 

This isn’t Heaven.
This isn’t Hell.
This isn’t anything you could have imagined. 
Death wasn’t the end.
Death wasn’t the answer.
Death was just the beginning.
So what do you do?
So what do you do?
Do you listen to the voice inside your head telling you just to let go?
Or do you still fight, still love, still feel the passion that won’t let you rest?
Oblivion’s the easy way out.
Life after death is hard.
Choose.
You have Eternity to weigh the consequences.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION™
It’s not about death.
It’s about what comes after.

Rage, rage, against the dying of the light   

Do not go gentle into that good night.

-Dylan Thomas

Death:  
What is it? 

What masks  
does it wear?    

What shall  
we say of it?  
What can be said  

for certain?

Why does  
death hold such  
lasting  
fascination? 

There are  
so many  
questions, and so  
few answers. 

For what  
could be more  
mysterious? What  
subject more  

incomprehensible?

How to  
speak of that which  

cannot be shared? 

The living are as shallow  

as they are witless. 

They ask the questions  

but don’t want the answers.

They are as bound by  
lies as they are by truth.  
But soon this will one will  
no longer be bound by either.

Motivated by nothing they 

can name, these killers have 

done their will. But the 

demons have fled, and now 

the puppets stand confused.

How easy the birth into death, 

as compared to the birth into 

life. First there is pain, then 

there is nothing. Agony, torture, 

relief. It is over. Praise Charon 

that I am here in time.

Always am I struck by how they 
fumble like newborn babes – by 
the look in their faces as they 
first behold the shell in which 
they so long resided.

Well, you thirsted for the 
knowledge, and now you have 
the truth of it.

It’s really not that bewildering; 
you’ve just got to bring things…

… into perspective.  

Welcome to reality, Larva. It  

just takes a little getting used to,  

seeing the death in things. Seeing life’s true form.

Death surrounds us, 
constantly threatening and 
eventually overwhelming us. 
It cannot be ignored or 
forgotten.

The stench of death taints 
everything we say and do. 
The suffering of the human 
condition is described by 
the despair of purpose 
and the angst of spiritual 
malaise. Life is so often 
devoid of meaning or 
significance.

Life does not last long; it 
is but a spark in the dead, 
black night. Welcoming us at 
the terminus of life, Death 
awaits us ever patient.

Death is a rebirth. It is 
a stepping over, a passage 
through the Shroud. It 
is not an ending, but a 
beginning. It is a rite of 
passage, the end of one 
journey and the beginning 
of another.

The fear, the loathing, 
the terror, the peace, the 
salvation, the ecstasy, the 
pain, and the oblivion. That 
is death. Death is all, and 
it is nothing.

Don’t let your terror rule you.  

There’s naught I can do if you let your shadow rule 

you. If you slip through the cracks, 

 I cannot hoist you back up.

Alas, much weighs upon you, dark child, and Oblivion cannot be delayed. The nightmares pull you down...

Into the Tempest.  

This is the whirlpool  

at the rim of reality,  

a roiling sea of curses,  

and hatred. 

 This is the void,  

and nothing  

is real here.  

Know that here  

imagination creates 

its own form.

Where are you now, boy? 
Will you find your way?

Will the path be barred? 
You know of transcendence, but you are not ready for it. 
The guardian blocks the way.  
Its crimson torch has warned others.

Spectres. Blighted creatures. 
They carry with them the stench of Oblivion. 
They are the bottom crawlers and feed upon the hopeless.

They’re getting to know you. They embrace your nightmares and fill them up. 
They awaken the Shadow asleep within you. 
They seek to conquer and consume you.

But I will not allow it, 
I have need of you. And, if I must, I will pay the price.

The hangman’s fee. 
This Doomshade can be bought; it owes me that. 
Stand back, demon spawn, for I claim this soul as mine. Now come with me.

And they initiate their own 

with these rituals...

...their own games, their own entertainments. They fight each other in death 

 because they cannot leave behind the pain of life.

...rituals of hazing and punishment. Some buy Drones to savage, to 

relieve themselves of misery by inflicting it upon others. Be glad that 

you are not one of them...

R I G I D 

E M B R A C E

These wretches will take what they can from you. They’ll steal all the 

relics you’ve brought with you and the last oboli in your purse.  

They have their own cruel code here...

When it comes to death, we all possess a ramshackle of 
hope, faith, fear, desire, and denial. Our minds conjure up 
a unique vision, images drawn from dusty folklore, kinetic 
pop culture, and the annals of personal experience.  
The mask of Death is whatever we make it to be.

Like beauty, death rests in the eye of the beholder. 

But call it what you will, the truth of it cannot be denied, 
just as it cannot be thwarted.

For some, death is as horrible as it is undeniable – a 
scourge and a devil. For others it is less terrifying and 
more palatable – annoying but irrelevant. To a few it is a 
benevolent god – an entity to be understood and respected.  
For many, death has become anthropomorphized, no more 
than concept or tool. Some of us pretend it doesn’t matter, 
but in the end it’s the only relationship we possess that 
doesn’t die. 

Death is always with us.

They war down here — legion and host, gang and cohort, cult and clique. 

Grim battles fought by both maneuver and bluff. Machines stolen from 

junk heaps, cobbled together with twine and prayer. Fearful nevertheless.

They fight over haunts and relics, insults and honor. And most especially 

over the newly dead. Larvae such as you are the heart of this grim 

commerce.

Masks that protect. Masks that 

conceal. Masks that hide. 

I wonder... who is being duped more? 

But enough illusions. How about a 

dose of truth?

... for even their leaders are hardly what they seem. 

They, too, wear masks...

This is the heart of the 
Hierarchy’s nest, the place 
where the condemned must stand

Unload them roughly or gently; 
it does not matter. Most 
shall be hauled off 
to the pits of Stygia.

Their warriors are the dead of 
many wars. They fear nothing.

Struggle they might, but these 
Thralls cannot resist. They  

will be judged this day.

To the living this old courthouse is 
a museum, but the dead still put it 
to its original purpose.

Some are already 
judged — the 
failed refuse, 
the beggar  

Thralls

See that man up 

there? Does he not 

look familiar? Think 

back to those old 

grainy photographs  

in your family  

album. That’s your 

father’s father, four 

times back. He’s your 

blood; he’s behind 

all this. If only he 

knew who you were.

You can see his 
tender mercies

The thousands of things undone, the millions of roads less 
traveled, the longing and regrets: they do not die with the 
body. Instead they linger on and take on lives of their own. 
They become ghosts. Sometimes the longings are so profound 
that their essence remains trapped between this world and the 
next, held back by misery and pain. 

This is the denial of death. 

The only thing holding us back is fear – fear that we aren’t 
ready, that we won’t survive the trip, fear of the unknown. 

We all pray that the anguish of life does not exist beyond 
death, but at the same time we fear the unknown Oblivion. Our 
fear of death can turn life into a nightmare. We fail to enjoy 
life because of our fear of death.

We watch our dreams slip away from us, and our cowardice 
haunts us to the end of our days and beyond. The icy touch of 
fear sits on our shoulders, but seldom do we realize what it is 
we fear. For death hides itself well. 

The cycle of fear isn’t over when we die; it just begins all over 
again. The pain doesn’t stop, and no answers are given. Mortal 
anguish is replaced by the immortal. The wheels turn ever on.

The meat of the body is gone, worm meal in an empty grave, 
but the essence remains. The spirit clings to its past, never 
quite trusting or strong enough to let go. It’s the path to 
Transcendence. Once unfinished tasks are completed and fetters 
to reality are loosened, it can pass on.

The irony is that death, even in death, can’t be escaped. And 
neither can the fear. 

So deal with it.

And you can see 
his judgment, 
how it is 
swift.

This is the great escape.

W her e is the  Wa iling Wall? They  wa il towa r d a n u n feeling  heaven.  B ut  the  sk y  offer s  no  r ewa r d  her e.

They a r e the B or n Aga in — D o you  r ecog n ize h im? Fr om  T V ?

These Her etic s a r e in ec stac y. They believe h is pr om ises.

Repent, ye sin ner s — A Necr opolis of the dead, still  a fra id of  dy ing

Can you stand to look at what 
you once were? To look into  
the eyes of those you left  
behind? Can you stand to  
return home?

Our sister’s eyes reveal much... she knows more than 
any child should know... and she is beyond your help 
now. Her sister keeps her awake...

Wraiths are the screamers, trapped by their own pasts, by their 
own memories, by their very consciousness. They are, therefore 
they feel. 

They remain because they must, because they cannot let go. They 
have some grating seed of meaning left to perform, express, 
excise. They still have something to say. There are as many 
reasons for why they remain as there are places for them to 
go. All existence is expression, and the dead are all poets, 
starving for enough meaning to survive. 

They are bound by a tragic sense of a life unfulfilled, by 
unsaid words breaking in their hearts – by a life cut short by 
Fate. Some are driven by bitterness and rage; others, by ideals 
they champion beyond the grave. Some still long for meaning and 
fulfillment ever denied them in life. 

Many are the products of violent, cruel and sudden deaths. The 
end comes by surprise, leaving no chance to resolve a lifetime 
of half-told stories. They are bound to their lost lives, and are 
likely to remain in the shadows for long. 

They shall not rest.

She is 
experienced at what she 
does, enough to attract an 
audience. In her line of 
work she is never  
short of cash.

Mother dearest. She still hasn’t 
kicked the habit. These are the 
people you left behind. Are 
you proud of them? Are you 
anguished?
Don’t think that this journey is 
done. We have more stops and 
yet more pain to reap.

...for the City of the Dead. The penitent has made the leap and received his prayer. 
Only he’s gotten more than he asked. The scavengers always find the dead; that is their purpose.

This shall be your cohort, and this place your haunt. 
We are more at home in such forgotten places; here we do not bump into them.

Do you not see how death makes a mockery of our bodies?  
We become as twisted without as we are within. And yet we cling to these shadows

wherein it is easier for us to draw our unliving breath.  
We deny Oblivion her need, yet we fail to live with what is left to us.

You must learn to be one of them; embrace their ways. 
Look past their faces, for their faces are only masks

Some masks are more grotesque than others. Judge not the Restless by appearances. 
They are circumstantial. These are not privileged, but they will protect your and provide you with a home. 
Now come... let me show you a lower breed...

This is the Kiss of Death. You see 
now who I am. I am  
the Incarnation of Death 
— a Ferryman, but also a Reaper. 
I have chosen you. 
Someday you must carry my load 
and sweep this scythe.

It is time to say farewell. 
Your friends are here  
to send you off,  
with a Viking funeral no less. 
Better to be buried with your 
ship than without it.

Plunge. Into the blackest night.

Dare I tell you who you are? 
Dare I indeed? I shall say this,  
do not forget it. 
Your name is Kirk.

Where are the Answers? 

Does existence hold purpose and meaning? Or is eternal Oblivion the only truth? 

At one time we thought we had all the answers. The truth was clear, the explanations 
complete. The priests spoke their words, shouting down from on high, and the gathered 
host listened. Not all, but most. Enough. But that was before…

But God is dead, His altars overturned. Death has no name in this gilded age. Rationality provides no 
answers, just explanations, and cannot speak of such things. 

What lies beyond this place, none can say. Transcendence? Who dares hope?

But to confront death we must find within ourselves the seed of Thanatos, the wish 
for death. You must confront the scourge, face it nose forward. Some do not seek 
Transcendence; indeed, they dread it. Out of terror they cling to the trappings of life and 
remain bound to this world while existing in the next. This is the coward’s way. 

Transcendence of any sort requires passage through the Void, the soul of Oblivion. The 
journey is most perilous, and few survive it intact. The inner Void of the Shadow must 
be challenged, defeated and embraced. Nihilism must be denied, fear spurned, passion 
wrought, and life at last truly lived. Those who have not faced their Shadows, who have 
not fought, overcome, and exalted, are in the end consumed. Oblivion awaits those who 
refuse to live. 

Those who deny Oblivion for too long are eventually eaten by it. The Shadow thrives on 
angst and pain and fear.

 To forget is to die…to die truly and finally. 

Face Old Man Death, look him in the eyes, and say – I do not go gently.

Farewell, my lover, my child. You’ve much to see. Your journey into death has just begun.

Book One

umans  have  always  told  ghost  stories. 
From the first stirrings of civilization as 
our ancestors huddled around campfires, 
to  the  mannered  spectres  of  English 
Christmastime  tradition,  to  the  found-
footage ghost hunting “documentaries” of 
today, we’ve always been fascinated with 
death and the possibility that there might be something that 
comes after. We’ve found a million ways to tell those stories, 
from the reassuring to the terrifying to the humorous, but 
in all of them, we’ve looked to the other side of the veil in 
hopes of finding someone there.

Wraith: The Oblivion is another way for us to tell ghost 
stories, only these aren’t told around that paleolithic campfire 
or by a single teller. The stories of Wraith are simultaneously 
written and told collectively by groups of players and their 
Storytellers. Sit down to play Wraith and you’re helping to 
write the next chapter in a tale that belongs to you and your 
friends, a ghost story that no one’s heard before. 
Because in Wraith, you play the ghosts.
This book is the how-to guide for telling those stories. It 
has all the settings, rules, and tools a Storyteller and players 
need to tell their tale within the framework of the game. Here 
is everything a player needs to become a wraith, a ghost with 
unfinished business, whose passions tie them to the land of 
the living. Here’s the world they explore, the means to map 
out all their defeats and victories and adventures. 

And that’s the key to Wraith: not “winning” or “losing,” 
because in a game like Wraith those concepts don’t apply. 
If you’ve played roleplaying games before, you already know 
this; if you haven’t, get yourself ready for a new type of game 
experience, where the journey, not the arbitrary destination, 
is what matters. It may sound a little strange, but it’s nothing 
you haven’t done before. It’s just that this time, rather than 
playing cops and robbers, you’ll be someone else, someone 
who’s crossed over and isn’t ready to let go.

You’ll be the star of your own ghost story.
So, let’s get started. It’s time to dive into the Underworld 
and see what’s waiting there. Time to learn about the ancient 
empire of the dead, and the tragic legacy of the mighty ghost 
known as Charon. Time to take up arms against the raven-
ing servants of Oblivion, or to walk the mean streets of your 
hometown and haunt those who wronged you in life. Time 
to see what this book has to offer, and make it your own.

A Little History

wenty years ago, the first edition of Wraith 
put the tools for telling those stories in 
people’s hands. It offered rules for playing 
one  of  the  Restless  Dead,  and  outlined 
the vast, terrifying world they inhabited 
postmortem.  Since  that  initial  edition, 
Wraith  has  seen  a  lot  of  changes.  The 

Chapter 1:  Introductionsetting  was  explored  and  expanded.  Rules  were  added  and 
revised. Games were played, stories were told, and ultimately, 
the world — or at least the version familiar to players of Wraith 
in its classic form — ended.

But the whole point of ghost stories is that the end isn’t always 
the end. Sometimes it’s just the beginning. And so, two decades 
on, Wraith was reborn in this new, expanded, and updated edition. 
If this is your introduction to the world of Wraith, everything 
you need to play is right here. There’s no need to worry about 
content from older editions or catching up. If you played Wraith 
in one of its earlier incarnations, you will probably notice certain 
changes  —  new  rules  designed  to  streamline  or  correct  older 
ones, adjustments to the setting to make it more cohesive, and 
others — but at its heart, Wraith remains Wraith. 

Storytelling and Roleplaying

umans are storytelling creatures. We see a 
flash of lightning, and we create the story of 
angry Zeus on Olympus tossing thunderbolts 
in his rage. Telling stories, whether it’s in 
the thousand pages of an epic novel or 140 
characters at a time, is part of who we are 
and what we instinctively do. 
And in telling stories, we take on the roles of the characters 
in those stories. We put on masks and assume voices not our 
own. We become the heroes and villains, the noble allies and 
the innocent bystanders. We become part of the stories we tell.
Wraith is part of that storytelling tradition, albeit not in 
the traditional method of tale-teller and audience. A game of 
Wraith does have a Storyteller, someone who sets the stage and 
guides the action, but the story doesn’t belong to them alone. 
Each player also contributes by taking up a role, or as we call 
it, playing a character. What that character says and does also 
helps shape the story, making sure it’s told — and heard — by 
everyone playing.

The flipside of the storytelling experience is the roleplaying 
one. Wraith is a roleplaying game in the classic sense, less about 
leveling up than it is about the opportunity to play someone 
else  and  experience  what  it’s  like  being  in  their  skin  (or,  in 
this case, ectoplasm). On that level, it’s no different from the 
games we played as kids, pretending to be superheroes or giant 
monsters or whatever we wanted to be. The only difference is 
rules: The roles we played on the swingset or jungle gym were 
bounded only by our imaginations and the recess bell. Wraith, 
on the other hand, has specific rules to help shape the action 
and move it along. The rules set up the boundaries of the story 
and the world, letting you know what you can and can’t do, 
and how to do what your character wants to try. They provide 
a means for resolving conflicts and describing challenges. As 
kids, we argued “Got you!” “Did not!” “Did too!” when we hit 
a moment of conflict in the stories we were telling. In Wraith, 
we check the rules and roll the appropriate dice, if needed, to 
accomplish the same thing.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

All of the rules you’ll need to play Wraith are located in Chapter 
Three. Those are the basics. The others that you’ll find elsewhere 
within — whether we’re talking about the ghostly powers called 
Arcanoi or how to do a shootout with spectral bullets — are the 
specifics that give the story, for lack of a better word, life.

Wraith, in its basic form, is played by everyone sitting down at 
a table, real or virtual, and going through a chapter of the ongoing 
campaign together. While there’s no official upper limit for the 
number of players you can have in a game, more than a half dozen 
tends to get unwieldy. Throw in the fact that you can’t always 
get  everyone  in  the  group  together  for  every  session,  meaning 
Storytellers will have to cover for characters whose players aren’t 
there, and it’s best to keep things simpler, and smaller.

How to Use This Book:

his  book  is  divided  into  13  chapters  and 
an  appendix,  each  of  which  defines  and 
describes one particular aspect of the game. 
It’s  important  to  remember  that  what’s 
contained  in  these  chapters  is  a  starting 
point, not the be all and end all. It’s your 
game,  and  you  should  always  feel  free  to 
adapt the elements of Wraith that work best for you and your 
game. In addition, in several places you’ll find alternate ways of 
handling things like Shadowguiding and Harrowings, to allow for 
a variety of play styles. There’s no “right” answer, just a variety 
of tools you can use to make your game what you want it to be.
Chapter One: An Introduction — The basics of Wraith 

and a first step into the world of the Restless Dead.

Chapter Two: The Underworld — A look at the world 
of Wraith, from the lands of the living to the deepest heart of 
Oblivion and the society of the dead.

Chapter Three: Rules — A walk through the rules that 

define Wraith and all its systems.

Chapter Four: Character Creation — How to create a 

character for Wraith, from first concept to finishing touches.

Chapter Five: Traits and Guilds — Detailed writeups of 
the various character traits and powers that go into a wraith 
character, as well as an introduction to the Guilds who practice 
the various ghostly Arcanoi.

Chapter Six: The Shadow — A guide to the dark side of 
every wraith’s personality, both the concept and how to build 
one. Also included are rules and techniques for Harrowings.

Chapter Seven: Storytelling — Advice and techniques for 
running Wraith games, from gothic horror to undead adventure 
to horror comedy.

Chapter Eight: Systems — The nuts and bolts of gameplay, 
from traveling between levels of the Underworld to experience 
points and everything in between.

Chapter Nine: Drama — A reference for the common 
structures and actions of a Wraith game, from scene composition 
to rules for combat.

Chapter Ten: Spectres — A guide to Spectres (wraiths 
who have succumbed to Oblivion) and other, more dangerous 
denizens of the Underworld.

Chapter 11: The Risen — Rules and concepts for playing 
and Storytelling Risen, wraiths who’ve climbed back into their 
bodies and been set loose in the Skinlands.

Chapter  12:  The  World  of  Darkness  —  Mediums, 
vampires,  ghost  hunters,  werewolves  and  more,  how  they 
interact with the Restless Dead, and how to integrate them 
into a chronicle.

Chapter 13: The Dark Kingdoms — Stygia isn’t the only 

place the dead go when they cross over. 

Appendix: Orpheus — A guide to integrating the world 
of Orpheus — living mortals who infiltrate the Underworld 
— into Wraith.

Roles
The Storyteller

very story needs a Storyteller, and the ones 
you create collectively playing Wraith are 
no exception. The Storyteller is equal parts 
director,  deity,  and  casting  agent  for  the 
game.  It’s  their  responsibility  to  craft  the 
outline of the game narrative, to prepare the 
material the players are going to encounter, 
and to take the parts of everyone else in the world — living 
and dead — that the players’ characters will encounter. They 
have to be ready to improvise to meet the challenge of what the 
players might do, and to play a dozen parts in a dozen minutes if 
necessary in order to populate the slice of the afterlife in which 
their campaign takes place.

But most importantly, a Storyteller’s role is to make sure 
that  everyone  is  having  fun.  That  doesn’t  mean  catering  to 
everyone’s whims and giving each character exactly what they 
want. Nor does it mean bowing to every player request to make 
sure that everyone goes home happy. Rather, it means telling 
a story that each of the players feels like they’re an integral 
part of. It means making sure that everyone is involved — if 
not at every single moment — and comfortable. And it means 
understanding that the story being told belongs to everyone — 
Storyteller and players alike — so that players don’t run amok 
and Storytellers don’t railroad players down a plot track they 
have no interest in following. 

In more practical terms, the Storyteller is also the arbiter 
of the rules of the game. It’s the Storyteller who decides what 
rolls are made when, and when it’s good to fudge the results a 
little in order to make for better drama. It’s also the Storyteller’s 
role to enforce the rules of the world, to ensure that the playing 
field is level for everyone. As such, it’s important for aspiring 
Storytellers to be at least reasonably familiar with the contents of 
this book, especially the basics of the world and the core systems

suchlike. That doesn’t mean needing to memorize every word 
— the book is, after all, designed as a reference for play — but 
it does mean knowing how to keep the game running smoothly, 
and being willing to double-check on things you don’t know.

Storytelling  Wraith  can  be  challenging.  It  can  also  be 
incredibly rewarding. Bringing the world of the dead to life for 
you and your players can make for play sessions that are enjoyable, 
moving, and emotionally powerful. And at the end of each session, 
you’ll have a story that belongs to you and your players alone.
For more on the Storyteller’s role, see Chapter Seven.

The Player

No Storyteller can function without players, the actors in the 
drama they create together. Players each take one major (and one 
minor — more on that later) part in the world, creating a player 
character to serve as their avatar in the Underworld. This character 
is a wraith, one of the Restless Dead, and it’s how they choose to 
interact with the story: a collection of traits, skills, powers, and 
narrative elements that make for a unique personality. When play 
starts, the player puts on the guise of their character, reacting 
as they would in a sort of improvisational theater supplemented 
with rules to describe actions and interactions. It’s the player 
who decides what their character does and doesn’t do, and who 
interacts with the other players as part of the group. Every word 
the wraith says and every action they take comes from the player.
But there’s a twist. Each wraith also has a dark side, called 
The  Shadow.  And  each  player,  in  addition  to  playing  their 
wraith, also takes a turn playing another character’s Shadow. 
There’ll be more on this later in the book, but this style of play, 
called Shadowguiding, provides a unique play experience, and 
the chance to take on multiple roles during a single campaign.
Ultimately,  it’s  the  player’s  responsibility  to  play  —  to 
interact with the Storyteller and the other players. That doesn’t 
mean being in the spotlight at every single moment, but it does 
mean being involved, active, and aware of the rules and the 
ongoing story. Got that, and you’re good to go.

Because really, what’s better than telling a story with your 

friends?

Character

As noted above, playing Wraith means making a character. 
Wraith characters are ghosts, members of the Restless Dead who 
have unfinished business on Earth or in the hereafter. It is the 
player’s job to figure out, with some help from the Storyteller 
and maybe the other players, who their unique character is. 
That means both coming up with a name and a backstory (for 
example: “Bob was a firefighter who was killed while rescuing 
a small child from a fiery death”), and following the rules of 
character creation to build your character’s capabilities according 
to the rules. That allows you to know what your wraith can and 
can’t do, while also helping you figure out who they are, how’d 
they react to things, and what they hope to achieve.

The more fully fleshed out a Wraith character is, the easier 
it is to play them. Beyond the dots on the character sheet that 
say how strong they are, it’s useful to know what really makes 
them tick. Where are they from? What did they do for a living? 
Did they leave family or loved ones behind when they passed 
on? The more questions like that you can answer, the more 
real your character becomes, and the easier it is to play them 
through the ever-changing scenario of a Wraith campaign.

Winners and Losers

Nobody wins a game of Wraith. Nobody loses, either, at 
least not in the traditional sense. Characters may triumph or 
fall, but the story goes on to the next chapter. The cast may 
change along the way as players decide a particular character’s 
story has come to an end, but that doesn’t mean the player’s 
role ends as well. Even if a character is destroyed, that’s just 
an opportunity to take on a new role and try new adventures.
Which is another way of saying that playing Wraith means 
setting aside old ideas of what you’re getting out of a game. It’s 
the experience that matters, whether that’s helping fend off a 
wave of Spectres or coming to grips with one of the things that’s 
keeping your character from moving on. You can win fights or 
lose them; you can also “win” without rolling dice or facing a 
single enemy, simply by playing a scene in a way that’s rewarding 
to you and the people you’re playing with. Success is in telling 
a satisfying story. Everything else is just details. 

Playing Aids

There are very few physical requirements for playing Wraith. 
You’ll  need  enough  ten-sided  dice  for  the  group,  as  well  as 
pencils and printed character sheets if you’re going hardcopy. 
Beyond that, it’s all set dressing. Use whatever works to make 
your game more enjoyable and get you and your fellow players 
in the mood, though you should draw the line at props that 
make other players uncomfortable. Spooky music, lit candles, 
clanking chains, letters and old newspaper clippings and more, 
all of these can enhance a game and make the experience more 
immersive. Just remember that the props should always be there 
in the service of the story, and not the other way around.

In this chapter and the ones that follow, there will be a 
great many specific (and sometimes capitalized) terms used to 
describe elements of Wraith. A complete glossary of these terms 
is at the end of this chapter.

and doing, you get to say and do it yourself, removing a layer 
between you and your character. 

LARPing  Wraith  can  be  a  little  tricky  —  no  one  has 
figured out a way to walk through walls, for example — which 
means  adapting  rules  or  using  rules  sets  like  the  ones  in 
Mind’s Eye Theatre. At the same time, live-action play can 
offer an enjoyable variation on the Wraith experience, with 
the possibility of larger games, more emergent gameplay, and 
character cosplay. The specific rules you use matter less than 
making sure everyone has a good time.

The Basics
What Is a Wraith?

verybody dies with unfinished business. For 
most people, it’s not enough to keep them 
from moving on to whatever’s next, be it 
Heaven, Hell, another incarnation, or the 
eternal void that is Oblivion. But for a few, 
the pull of things left undone is enough to 
keep them tied, however tenuously, to this 

existence. These are the Restless Dead.

These are wraiths.
Simply  put,  wraiths  are  the  spirits  of  the  dead  who,  for 
whatever reason, have not moved on from the trappings of their 
lives. Some cling to the things, places, and people that they 
love. These things, called Fetters, bind them to the lands of the 
living and anchor them against the insatiable pull of Oblivion. 
Others have come to terms with their ghostly existence and 
have continued to dwell in the Underworld long after all the 
countries they once dwelt in have crumbled to dust. 

Suspended between life and death, wraiths must deal with 
the challenges of their new existence. They may choose to stay 
close to the lands of the living, interacting with the so-called 
Skinlands and haunting those who yet draw breath. Others move 
into the deeper Underworld, taking a part in — or taking up 
arms against — Stygia, the ancient empire of the dead.

In Wraith: The Oblivion, you play the part of a wraith, one 
of these restless spirits who still has work to do. Caught between 
the relentless gravity of Oblivion, the perilous existence of a 
wraith in the empire of the dead, and the ever-more-distant 
lands of the living, you must find a way to carry on.

The Underworld

A breath away but vast beyond human comprehension, the 
lands of the dead are collectively called The Underworld. Stygia, 
the Tempest, and the Shadowlands are where most wraiths spend 
the bulk of their existences, but the Far Shores, the Labyrinth, 
and the Void are also part of the so-called Deadlands. 

Sitting across the Underworld from Stygia, the Far Shores 
are  an  endless  archipelago  of  islands.  Some  wraiths  believe 
paradise can be found here, or Hell; explorers who’ve ventured 

THE CORE RULES OF PLAY
Certain boundaries should not be crossed, whether 
you’re sitting at the game table or LARPing in 
full  costumed  splendor.  Wraith  games  are  for 
everyone playing them, which means:

No Touching — Always respect other players’ 
boundaries. Getting physical crosses a line, even 
if you’re just trying to demonstrate the move your 
character is trying to make. Tabletop or LARP, 
respect other players’ space.

Know When to Stop — Emotional bound-
aries are just as important as physical ones, and 
Wraith can touch on some dark material. Be will-
ing to stop play and step back a bit, or abandon a 
plotline if it’s causing someone distress. 

No Weapons — Weapons can make for glori-
ous pieces of costuming, but they can also cause 
accidents or get misunderstood by bystanders (if, 
say, you’re LARPing in a public space). Props are 
fine,  but  the  real  thing  potentially  presents  too 
many disruptions.

Respect the People Who Aren’t Playing — If 
you’re in a public space, whether it’s a table in a 
game store or a LARP in a coffeehouse, try to be 
aware and respectful of the people around you. 
They may not know what you’re doing, so overen-
thusiastic declarations of intent to cause in-game 
mayhem may accidentally produce out-of-game 
consequences. And be willing to explain what 
you’re doing to curious passersby. Who knows, 
you might get yourself another player that way.

that far say they’ve found both, lorded over by would-be gods 
and devils. In truth, no one knows what the Far Shores hold, 
but the empire has forbidden journeying there.

Howling forever is the Tempest, the eternal storm where 
Spectres  roam  free  and  Ferrymen  silently  pole  their  rafts  to 
unknown  purpose.  Rare  islands  of  stability  exist  within  the 
endless winds; Stygia is built on one, and other Dark Kingdoms 
are known to stand against the storm as well. There are also 
safe paths, called Byways, through the storm. Their locations 
are known to only a few, and they are jealously guarded.

At the heart of the storm is a monstrous, constantly shifting 
Labyrinth.  This  is  where  Spectres  dwell  and  the  monstrous 
Neverborn  slumber,  dreaming  of  destruction.  Every  horrific 
landscape imaginable can be found here, along with some that 
defy imagination. And at the very center of the Labyrinth is 
the  mouth  of  the  Void,  the  sucking  maw  of  Oblivion  made 
manifest and deadly. 

INTRODUCTION

19

Not  every  Byway  leads  down.  Some  instead  take  the 
traveler to the Shadowlands, a layer of reality that sits atop 
the Skinlands of the living like a translucent blanket. Full of 
memories and echoes given form — destroyed buildings and 
ancient roads — it is where many ghosts with strong Fetters still 
dwell. The Shroud, a membrane of fear and disbelief, separates 
the  Shadowlands  from  the  Skinlands.  Where  it  grows  thin, 
wraiths  can  affect  the  living  more  easily  and  places  acquire 
reputations for being haunted. 

Of course, this doesn’t match any faith’s view of the afterlife. 
Stygia is neither Heaven nor Hell, though many of its denizens 
joke  that  it  just  might  be  Purgatory.  Most  humans  who  die 
never appear in the Underworld. What happens to them, the 
Restless Dead do not know. 

But despite its horrors and excesses, most wraiths readily 
concede  it’s  better  than  the  visible  alternative.  And  so  the 
streets of Stygia are full of the Restless Dead, born of every age 
from ancient Athens to the modern day, all holding the line 
against Oblivion in their own way, and for as long as it takes.

Wraith Characteristics

Being one of the Restless Dead isn’t all bad. You may be 
on the wrong side of the Shroud, but every wraith does possess 
certain abilities as a byproduct of their ghostly nature:

Insubstantiality  —  The  basic  element  of  the  ghostly 
condition, being insubstantial is both a blessing and a curse. 
On the one hand, it allows wraiths to walk through walls, let 
bullets, fists, and speeding cars pass right through them, and 
otherwise laugh off the perils of the physical world. On the other 
hand, being unable to touch anything makes it that much more 
difficult for wraiths to affect the lands of the living. 

Deathsight — Being dead literally affects one’s outlook. Being 
dead, wraiths see the world as broken down and dying. Plants 
look withered, humans have a corpse-like pallor, and buildings 
look like they’re about to crumble. It’s a result of wraiths being 
able to instinctively sense how much something has been tainted 
by the touch of Oblivion. The more ramshackle it — or they — 
appear, the more heavily it’s been affected. On the more practical 
side, this also allows wraiths to see an object’s weak points, and 
to assess the general health of a living being. 

Lifesight — Just as they can see death, wraiths can also see 
life. Every wraith is capable of seeing the auras around living 
beings, the swirling shells of color that change from moment to 
moment according to their health, mood, and state of mind. With 
a little practice, wraiths can use this ability to get a reading on 
what one of the Quick is likely to do next, and if they’re lying.
Sharpened Senses — The Restless have incredibly sharp 
senses. They can pick up the faintest scents, hear whispered 
conversations, and pick out the tiniest details when they set 

20

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

their minds to it. On the other hand, loud noises, bright lights, 
and other forms of sensory overload can temporarily overwhelm 
or even harm them. 

The Passion and the Horror

The Shadow

The devil on the shoulder, the imp of the perverse, the little 
voice in the back of your head telling you to do the thing you 
really shouldn’t — for wraiths, that voice is all too real. It’s called 
the Shadow, and it has a will of its own. Every wraith’s worst 
enemy lives inside their mind, constantly urging them down the 
path to Oblivion. The Shadow is a part of a wraith — the part 
bent on self-destruction — and it maintains an independent, 
malign existence inside the wraith’s head. 

Selfish,  sadistic,  and  seductive,  the  Shadow  will  bribe, 
cajole, threaten and occasionally take control, all in the interest 
of edging the wraith one step closer to the eternal precipice. 
They can offer power and assistance, using their unique gifts, 
called Thorns. But that assistance always comes at a price, and 
that price is always too high.

There is no conflict a wraith faces as deadly, as vicious, and 
as relentless as the one they fight alone against their Shadow. 
The Shadow is an enemy who can never be vanquished, and 
who knows the wraith’s darkest secrets and hidden weaknesses 
intimately. Psyche and Shadow are locked in combat for all 
eternity, and the greatest triumphs and most crushing defeats a 
wraith can face take place on the battlefield of their own soul.
More information about the Shadow can be found in Chapter Six.

Oblivion

The ultimate enemy for all of the Restless Dead is, simply 
put, Oblivion. It is the ultimate force of negation, the destruction 
of all things. It taints everything it touches. It fuels the Shadow 
and marshals legions of Spectres — wraiths who have given 
in to its blandishments — as the soldiers in its neverending 
war on all of reality. Most wraiths believe that Oblivion is the 
inevitable end of the road, which is why they cling so tightly to 
the Fetters that anchor them against Oblivion’s pull. But even 
those Fetters can fade or break, and untold millions of wraiths 
have been swallowed by the Void over the centuries.

Transcendence

There are those among the Restless, however, who hold that 
there is another way. Transcendence, an ascent to a higher state 
of being, is their hope and their watchword, and they struggle 
endlessly toward it. Of course, just as among the living, there 
are disagreements among the Restless as to how to achieve this 
state. A thousand and one paths to Transcendence have been 
described, but how many actually lead there, no one knows.

Regardless,  Transcendence  is  a  beacon  of  hope  in  the 
Underworld,  a  counterweight  to  the  omnipresent  darkness 
of Oblivion. And it is the stories of Transcendence, as much 
as the walls of the citadels and the tug of earthly Fetters, that 
encourage wraiths to keep resisting Oblivion.

Those two words define Wraith more than any other. Every 
wraith is driven by passion. It is what allows them to carry on in 
the face of Oblivion. Without the powerful drive to do something 
—  protect  a  loved  one,  fight  injustice,  wreak  vengeance  on 
enemies — a wraith is just a shell. Passion is what drives a wraith 
to act, and in acting, stay the hand of Oblivion.

But Wraith is a game of dualities. The flip side to passion’s 
coin is horror. Wraiths are dead, and they dwell in an Underworld 
capable of eternal torment and cruelty. Monsters older than 
the universe lurk in the corridors of the Labyrinth, and every 
one of the Restless has to deal with the demon living in their 
own head. The faint light of the possibility of Transcendence 
merely  allows  the  horrors  of  the  Underworld  to  cast  longer, 
deeper shadows.

Passion and horror, hope and fear, action and destruction — 
these dichotomies collide in Wraith. Passion without horror to 
overcome is wasted, while horror that does not inspire passion 
is weak. Where the two intersect and are intertwined forever, 
that is where you will find the Restless Dead.

carry Spectres and other, less identifiable things on their 
winds,  and  are  generally  triggered  by  horrific  events  in 
the Skinlands.

Mitty: A wraith whose main regret is not having done anything 

with their life. The Hierarchy is full of them.

Labyrinth,  whose  discoveries  set  the  stage  for  much  of 
Stygia’s development.

Nihils: Tears in the fabric of reality, temporary or permanent.

any wraith nearby when they open. Some, but not all, lead 
directly to the Labyrinth. 

Oblivion:  The  corrupting  hunger  of  entropy  to  devour  all 
things. It manifests in the Underworld as the Void, which 
is located at the heart of the Labyrinth. Also known as The

Obolus: The base unit of Stygian currency, forged out of one soul. 
Onyx Tower: The palace of the lost Emperor Charon, abandoned 

since his battle with Gorool.

Pathos: The energy of pure emotion, which wraiths feed upon 

and use to fuel their existences.

Quick, The: One of the living.
Reaper: A wraith who removes an Enfant’s Caul.
Relic: The ghost of an object, made out of plasm. 
Renegades: A catch-all term for wraiths who oppose Stygia.

City,” which is scavenged from the destroyed monuments 
of history and sits in the middle of the Tempest.

Tempest,  The:  The  endless  storm  that  rages  through  the 
Underworld. It separates the Shadowlands from the Far

from the Shadowlands to the Far Shores and encompassing 

Stygia and the other Dark Kingdoms, the Labyrinth, the

Void, The: The abyss at the center of the Labyrinth. 
Wraith: Also known as the Restless, a ghost with such strong 
attachments to the land of the living that she is bound to 
this level of existence. 

Source Material

host stories provide a particularly rich vein of 
inspiration for Wraith. From the classics — 
think Hamlet and Macbeth, not to mention 
Dickens,  and  Saul’s  biblical  visit  to  the 
Witch of Endor to summon up the shade 
of the prophet Samuel — to more recent 
hauntings like The Blair Witch Project and 
Ghost Hunters, there’s plenty of ghostly material to choose from. 
Here are some that may be particularly useful.

INTRODUCTION

23

he world of Wraith is not our world, though 
to  the  casual  observer  they  may  look 
remarkably similar. But a closer look shows 
the subtle differences, the deeper shadows 
and lurking darkness that defines the place 
where the Restless Dead walk. There’s still 
beauty in this world, still love and faith and 
hope that can inspire a soul even beyond the grave. But at the 
same time, it is a world of pain and fear and terror, a version of 
our world as we are afraid it might be. The light of the human 
spirit still burns brightly, but the shadows it casts are darker and 
longer, and highlight decay rather than hiding it.

Perhaps this is due to the metaphysical nearness of the so-
called Shadowlands, the part of the Underworld that drapes over 
the lands of the living like a spectral cloak. Surely the proximity 
of the lands of the dead to the realm of the living must have 
some chilling effect. Then again, the world as seen through the 
eyes of a wraith has never been a pretty place. It is truly a World 
of Darkness, one in which the flares of passion and defiance rise 
up, shine brightly, and then all too often are snuffed out.

This chapter describes, in detail, the world of Wraith. 
It covers everything from the basic metaphysics of ghostly 
existence to the history of Stygia, empire of the dead, to the 
peculiar  geography  of  the  Underworld.  Anything  a  well-
educated wraith needs to know is here.

Geography and Metaphysics
The Skinlands

n ghostly parlance, the lands of the living 
are known as the Skinlands. You or I would 
find ourselves largely at home there; the 
geography is the same, as is the (official) 
history,  the  content  of  the  pop  charts 
and the name of a given street sign. But 
because  this  is  the  World  of  Darkness, 
there’s an edge to it that is sometimes absent here. Winds 
blow colder and dirtier. Skyscrapers are both more ornate 
and more impenetrable to those who don’t belong inside. 
Cities are more crowded and closer to the brink; streets are 
more mazelike, with fewer lights and more dead ends. Even 
more than in our world, the citadels of the rich are clean 
and  elegant  and  somehow  removed  from  the  workaday 
reality others must deal with. And there is a subtle dread 
that  permeates  everything,  an  unspoken  expectation  that 
something is always about to go wrong.

The world of Wraith tilts heavily toward the gothic 
side of the gothic punk equation. Cathedrals boast more 
gargoyles  scowling  along  their  rooflines  and  architecture 

Chapter 2:  Settingsuggests the 19th century as much as the 21st. Bureaucracies 
are larger, more inefficient, and more impersonal. The sounds 
of excess rise from the gardens of the lucky few, while outside 
the shadows grow longer and colder every day.

But that’s not to dismiss the punk aspect as well. Coun-
terculture is vibrant and sometimes violent, throwing bricks 
through  the  roseate  windows  of  cathedrals  that  tower  over 
old neighborhoods. The streets are unsafe and anarchy reigns 
everywhere it isn’t forcibly clubbed back into the underground. 
While many who dwell in the Skinlands choose lives of quiet 
desperation,  there  are  always  those  who  are  determined  to 
burn bright and fast, reveling in every sensation the world 
has to offer.

It is a haunted world, and a dangerous one, both for the 
living and the dead. Wraiths can cross over into the Skinlands 
from the Underworld by use of powers called Arcanoi, but by 
and large they can only do so briefly. Even to attempt to do 
so is dangerous, for the laws of Stygia forbid contact with the 
world of the living, and other dangers lurk as well. Some places 
in the Skinlands are more easily breached by the dead than 
others. They often acquire reputations as haunted, and are 
usually abandoned by all but the desperate and the foolhardy.
Meanwhile, the living go about their business unaware of 
the world that moves alongside their own. And on those rare 
occasions when they are made aware of its existence, they do 
their best to forget what they’ve seen.

The Shroud and the Fog

The realms of the dead are separated from the Skinlands 
by a thin membrane of reality known as the Shroud. Invisible, 
and yet largely impenetrable, it allows the Restless to see the 
world of the living but prevents them from interacting with 
it. Stygian metaphysicists argue over what exactly comprises 
the Shroud, whether it be fear or disbelief or something far 
stranger, but what is known is that the Shroud was not always 
there. Before it existed, the living and the dead walked freely 
with one another, but as time passed and societies grew more 
fearful, the Shroud arose.

The Shroud is not always of a uniform thickness. In some 
places, particularly those where wraiths have violated Charon’s 
law and repeatedly crossed the Shroud, it is worn thin. Places 
where the Shroud is worn down in this way are often claimed 
as Haunts by enterprising wraiths, who take advantage of the 
ease of Skinlands interaction as best they can.

The Fog, on the other hand, exists solely in the minds of the 
living. It’s the term wraiths use for the defense mechanism that 
prevents humans from recognizing and remembering evidence 
of ghostly activity. Born from the innate fear of death, the Fog 
is the little voice telling you that it must have been the wind 
pushing that door open, that the ghostly reflection you saw in 
a mirror was just a trick of the light, and that there’s no pos-
sible way you could have seen blood dripping from the walls. 

Not everyone is susceptible to the Fog. Children and animals 
by and large are immune to its effects, perhaps because they 
don’t comprehend or fear death. Cats in particular are known 
for watching wraiths through the Shroud, and for reacting in 
unexpected ways to their presence in the Skinlands.

The Underworld

he  Underworld  is  the  collective  term  for 
all  of  the  realms  of  the  dead,  from  the 
Shadowlands that border on the lands of the 
living to the hellish depths of the Labyrinth, 
indescribably  far  away.  The  Underworld 
doesn’t  exist  as  a  singular  place.  Rather, 
it’s best thought of as a sort of onion-like 
metaphysical structure, with layers within layers that somehow 
keep getting bigger the further in you go. Scratch the surface of 
the Shadowlands and underneath you’ll find the roiling eternal 
storm of the Tempest. Go deep into the Tempest and you’ll find 
islands of stability — Stygia and the other kingdoms of the dead 
and eventually, the legendary Far Shores. Dive into the heart of 
the Tempest and you’ll find the monstrous, ever-changing maze 
called the Labyrinth that serves as a home to the uncounted 
armies of Spectres. And at the center of the Labyrinth is the 
maw  of  Oblivion  itself.  All  these  are  considered  part  of  the 
Underworld, though each offers unique attributes and dangers.
Gaze Upon My Works

The scenery in the Underworld can rarely be described 
as “beautiful.” It is the resting place for all of history’s ghosts; 
the torn-down buildings and shattered monuments all come 
to rest here, to be scavenged by the Restless Dead. Nothing 
grows here save the rare, stunted trees that line the banks of 
the Great River, and scenes of overwhelming horror can erupt 
at any moment. And yet it is also a world that wraiths cling to 
with unparalleled ferocity, one that can be fired by the strength 
of eternal love or defiant hope. Even in the desolation of the 
Shadowlands or the whirling chaos of the Tempest, there can 
be beauty.

Oblivion

At  its  most  basic  level,  Oblivion  is  the  force  of  passive 
destruction in the universe. It is the gaping maw of entropy, 
waiting patiently to devour everything in due time. Those who 
pass into the Void are gone forever, absorbed into the long dark 
and removed from this plane of existence.

But a little Oblivion goes a long way, and in the Underworld, 
it’s a far more vital force than one might expect. Not content 
to simply wait for time to bring it sustenance, it reaches out 
through its agents to hasten the inevitable decline of creation. 
It is Oblivion’s touch that turns wraiths into Shadow-Eaten 
Spectres, and that gives voice and power to the Shadow inside 
every  wraith’s  mind.  It’s  Oblivion  that  fuels  the  nightmare 

26

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

monstrosities of the Labyrinth and that sucks the material of its 
twisted walls out of the Tempest. And it is Oblivion that belches 
forth Maelstroms, the savage storms that scour the Underworld 
and devour the weak and unlucky. Sooner or later, all things 
must fall to Oblivion, but it would prefer sooner.

Physically, Oblivion manifests as the Void, the ultimate 
emptiness. The so-called Mouth of the Void, the gateway to this 
ever-expanding nothingness, rests at the heart of the Labyrinth. If 
there can be said to be an “up” and a “down” in the Underworld, 
the Mouth of the Void rests at its very lowest point. Nothing 
that enters its impenetrable darkness ever returns.

Surrounding  the  Mouth  of  the  Void  like  a  particularly 
warped seashell around a particularly unpleasant mollusk is the 
Labyrinth, the unending maze of passages stocked with horrors 
and home to countless Spectres. It’s impossible to say how large 
the Labyrinth is, as it is constantly shifting in size and even the 
few  stable  landmarks  are  subject  to  sudden  dislocation.  The 
flotsam of reality drifts down here, broken relics and abandoned 
Artifacts and Shadow-Eaten souls who have no more use for 
the light. Ancient Spectres, the so-called Neverborn, slumber 
uneasily in vast temples carved out by their spectral servants, 
while the laws of physics reverse themselves on a whim from 
corridor to corridor. Few wraiths venture here voluntarily, and 
fewer still return.

History of the Dark Kingdom of Iron

o those who existed and struggled through 
the  birth  and  continued  existence  of  the 
western  world’s  lands  of  the  dead,  a  few 
great moments of that journey are painted 
in vivid detail. They are the highlights of 
a long, and often brutal, battle to prolong 
existence  beyond  death  and  reach  the 
acceptance of themselves that allows wraiths to move on to a 
hoped-for higher realm of being. As with any history or great 
piece  of  artwork,  not  every  detail  is  portrayed  or  examined 
to the nth degree. Some mysteries (and even some outright 
exaggerations or hidden truths) remain, for to know a thing 
so well that it loses all wonder is to destroy whatever value it 
once had. This, then, is the usually agreed-upon basic history 
of this shadowed realm.

A Time Before Time 

There was a time before time began, a time before dark and 
light were divided, when living and dead existed separated only 
by a gossamer veil. The living could pass into the shadows and 
speak with the dead — to hear their wisdom or to bear mes-
sages from the dead to those they left behind. In like manner 
the dead could find their way back into the world of the living 
to visit loved ones or enemies without any hindrance to their 
return. Though not alive, they could interact with the living 

world in small ways. Stories are told of living heroes who made 
that crossing and returned to tell of their journeys. 

In  that  long  and  shadowed  time,  the  lands  of  the  dead 
remained ill-defined at best. The souls in the lands of the dead 
wandered through a hazy landscape composed of misremembered 
dreams and hopes, of foggy, dim memories and terrifying fears. 
Many sought some way to return to the world of the living or 
to move on and find peace and contentment in some recogniz-
able afterlife.

The Sundering

None know how long it was, or what might have caused 
such a thing to happen, but a great convulsion shook the earth, 
tearing a rift between the world of the living and that of the dead. 
This catastrophe forced the two realms apart, erecting a barrier 
called  the  Shroud  between  them.  This  barrier  permanently 
separated the realms of the living and the dead, allowing only 
the souls of the newly dead to cross. The lands of the living, or 
as the Restless Dead called them, the Quick, became known 
as the Skinlands. The vast and uncharted world on the other 
side of the Shroud, the realm of the dead, was the Underworld. 

Oblivion

At one time, Oblivion was not a ravenous corrupter. Rather, 
it was the manifestation of passive destruction, the void into 
which all things eventually fell when their time came. It did 
not seek out prey, as it did not need to. In time, all things came 
to it, dying in order to make room for the new. It was, in this 
pure incarnation, an essential part of the cycle of life and death. 
And  with  the  shock  that  separated  the  living  from  the 

dead, all of that suddenly changed. 

Once, wraiths had roamed a world made up of memories 
and dreams, occasionally drifting away when they no longer 
had a sufficient sense of self to continue. But with the rising 
of the Shroud, Oblivion awoke, and it was hungry. Reaching 
out, it stirred a sleeping part of every wraith’s mind, the vicious, 
selfish, despairing heart of darkness in every soul, and gave it 
voice. The Shadow now tore at wraiths from within their souls, 
urging them down the endless slope to Oblivion and tormenting 
them if they resisted. 
The Labyrinth

Oblivion also birthed gruesome and loathsome children 
— twisted and filled with hatred — and loosed these monsters 
on the Underworld. These monstrous beings were known as 
Malfeans, and they gnawed endless, twisted tunnels in the very 
fabric of reality that underpinned the afterlife, carving it into 
a mind-blasting Labyrinth. This maze became their prison, an 
ever-shifting nest that became home to all the foulness and 
Shadow-Eaten  of  the  Underworld.  And  at  its  heart  was  the 
maw of Oblivion, always ravenous.

The Lady of Fate

Amid the chaos and upheaval that shook the Underworld, 
a great hope emerged for the Restless Dead. The Lady of Fate 
stood before the fearful, trembling masses of souls and prophesied 
that a great leader would rise up in the Underworld. He would 
journey down the River of Death and guide souls who had made 
it through the rift to the safety of the Far Shores, where they 
might find eternal shelter from Oblivion. Hearing her, many 
wraiths took heart and felt a renewed will to resist the whispers 
of their Shadows and the pull of the Void. 

While this was her first act in defining the shape of the 
Underworld, it would hardly be the Lady of Fate’s last. She is 
perhaps the single most influential wraith in all of creation, the 
wise advisor who foretold Charon’s coming and counseled him 
even when his hubris led him astray. While others have faded 
with the centuries, she endures and, in her own way, watches 
over what she helped create. 

Charon 

Finally, from the dead of Mycenae, the one of whom the 
Lady  of  Fate  had  spoken  arose.  Traveler  and  guide,  he  was 
welcomed into the Underworld by the Lady herself. She gave 
him a boat woven of the reeds that lined the River of Death, 
encouraging him to sail its course and learn its mysteries — the 
secret inlets and tiny coves, wide bays and narrow passages, how 
it flowed and eddied and where it led. And when he knew it 
such that he and the river were almost as one, he could then 
return to guide other souls in their journey toward the prom-
ised Far Shores. There, they might find peace and safety from 
Oblivion and its servants. 

Charon  fulfilled  his  charge,  spending  many  years  alone 
exploring the great river. He traced its paths and tributaries 
through strange and otherworldly places, until he finally came 
to a wide delta where the river opened upon the great expanse 
of the Sunless Sea. There he found the river choked with spirits 
more numerous than grains of sand, stranded and abandoned 

A WORD ON THE FAR SHORES AND TRANSCENDENCE
Until the Lady of Fate spoke of these con-
cepts, many of the dead had never heard of them. 
All knew that some who died never came to the 
Underworld at all, but went on to a reward or 
punishment elsewhere or were then reborn. Now, 
however, those destinations had a name — the Far 
Shores. These were places to where the Restless 
Dead could journey in order to find their final 
reward. There, wraiths could find Transcendence, 
a way for those diverted to the Underworld to let go 
of whatever tied them to their Restless existence 
and travel onward —  just like the perfected souls 
that never arrived in the land of the dead at all.

PAYMENT FOR THE DEAD

In the beginning, as they had nothing else 
with  which  to  pay  the  tithe,  the  dead  might 
bargain  with  their  services  for  a  time.  Fearing 
that the longer they waited to make the crossing, 
however, the greater the chance they might fall 
to despair, some managed to contact those in the 
Skinlands and ask them to send payment onward 
as grave goods to render the tithe instead. 

Eventually,  the  idea  of  the  payment  for 
Charon (and later, the Ferrymen) prompted those 
left  behind  to  put  a  coin  over  each  eye  of  the 
person who died in order to pay for their crossing.

as they waited for passage across the unknown depths of the 
vast, dark ocean. 

At the river’s mouth the delta spread out into reedy marshes 
and a great, craggy island rose from the sea. That dangerous and 
forbidding promontory was named the Isle of Sorrows, its coast 
far too forbidding for any craft to land upon it.
The Lady’s Tasks and Charon’s Payment

Once  again,  the  Lady  of  Fate  intervened  on  Charon’s 
behalf, appearing to him and guiding him safely to a hidden 
landing on the isle. There she spoke to him of things to come. 
She told him that he would provide guidance and light to the 
great masses of the wandering dead. In return for his efforts, 
he would receive a tithe from the dead he assisted, payment 
for his aid in the crossing over the sunless waters. 

Charon went to the wandering dead and told them of the 
Lady’s vision. Inspired by his words, they made him their leader 
by acclamation. In return, he taught them how to make their 
own boats like his, woven from the reeds that carpeted the river 
delta. Many built their crafts and sailed across the Sunless Sea, 
seeking eternal rest on the Far Shores. But not all could make 
those journeys for themselves.
The Ferrymen

The Lady spoke of those among the wanderers who still 
had Fetters that bound them to the world of the living. These, 
she called the Restless. She foretold that they would come to 
Charon and learn from him the ways of the Underworld, so 
that they might endure and resist Oblivion until they might 
find peace. Some among the Restless who learned those arts 
chose not to follow Charon, but those who did became known 
as Ferrymen. The Ferrymen pledged themselves to help Charon 
carry souls down the river and across the Sunless Sea.

Upon the rocky tor of the Isle of Sorrows, the Ferrymen 
met to exchange ideas and information. They swore a further 
oath to Charon and their brethren to protect the travelers in 

28

their charge and to defend the Quick from the depredations of 
the Restless who refused Charon’s teachings.

Nhudri

Soon  after  the  Ferrymen  formalized  their  group,  many 
grotesque Spectres rushed forth from the Labyrinth, screaming 
their defiance and hatred. The Ferrymen met the assault and 
sheltered their passengers from these horrors, ensuring that the 
souls in their care would reach the Sunless Sea.

In response to the eruption, several Ferrymen crossed the 
sea to establish the safest route for carrying souls to the tranquil-
ity they sought. As their travels illuminated the way for others 
to follow, they became known as the Shining Ones. Though 
saddened by their departure, Charon knew their efforts would 
hasten the passage to eternal rest for those who came after.
The First Descent 

Once again, the Lady of Fate appeared to Charon, convinc-
ing him to descend into the Labyrinth to confront Oblivion 
directly. Heeding her words, he traveled to the Veinous Stair, 
so named for the bloody, veined marble steps that pulsed with 
Oblivion’s wrath. Armed with a lantern and scythe, Charon 
entered the great maze, bearing the only light in the utter dark-
ness. No Ferryman followed, but all heard the sounds of great 
battle emanating from the maw of the Labyrinth and wondered 
about the fate of their leader.

Emerging from the Labyrinth at last, Charon brought with 
him a smith wraith named Nhudri, who had been a prisoner of 
Oblivion. Long experienced in forgecraft, Nhudri knew how to 
create items using the souls of the dead as his materials. Seeing 
the value in this, both to create needed items and to keep weak 
souls from falling to Oblivion by using them thus, Charon gave 
Nhudri the responsibility for and the power to use his shaping 
abilities in the Shadowlands. 
The Shining Ones Return

When  Charon  returned  from  the  Labyrinth,  he  sailed 
down the River of Death to the Isle of Sorrows. There he used 
a  great  horn  to  summon  the  Ferrymen  to  him,  telling  them 
of his journey and his confrontation within the darkness. He 
emphasized that Oblivion was growing and described a terrible 
pit where the souls of those who were weak or unprotected and 
of the Restless who refused the call to become Ferrymen were 
trapped and then thrown down into the Void below.

Charon expressed disappointment with the Ferrymen that 
they had not been vigilant enough to prevent this, and they 
responded by redoubling their efforts. Many spread across the 
Underworld, seeking a way to better fight Oblivion and safeguard

SOULFORGING

When  Nhudri  followed  Charon  from  the 
Labyrinth, he brought with him a hellish forge 
called Kyklos. Upon this forge Nhudri created 
items and objects made from the souls of other 
wraiths.  Most  common  among  these  were  the 
coins called oboli, which fueled the trade of Stygia. 
Though Charon felt reservations concerning the 
enslavement of souls, he realized that Nhudri’s tal-
ent might save them all from falling to Oblivion. 

To create his works, Nhudri took wraiths and 
plunged portions of their Corpus into the blazing 
hellflames of Kyklos until they became malleable. 
Despite the agonized shrieks and frenzied writhing 
of the victims as they were twisted and deformed, 
the master (who would become known as the Lord 
High Artificer) took up his great hammer, beat-
ing and shaping them into the items he wished 
to make. With fire-hardened hands, whispered 
incantations, and his indomitable will he bound 
their souls into these objects and trapped them 
there in permanent shapes, known as Soulsteel. 
Thus began the art of Soulforging.

the souls in their keeping. Soon after the Ferrymen departed 
on their mission, the Shining Ones returned to tell of their 
finding the Far Shores. There, they said, wondrous Halls of the 
Dead existed. These housed fallen warriors, great thinkers, and 
virtuous souls of all sorts who feasted together and found the 
peace they had struggled to achieve in life. 

Taking the charts they provided to him, Charon set sail 
across the Sunless Sea to the Far Shores to see for himself what 
lay there. He was gone for many years, and the Ferrymen main-
tained their watch and guarded against Oblivion in his absence.

The Founding of the Empire and Building of Stygia

Charon’s return from the Far Shores coincided with the 
rise of the Roman Republic in the Skinlands. He bore with him 
seven signs, gifted to him by the Shining Ones who stayed across 
the Sunless Sea, taking the realms there under their protection. 
By these signs, Charon was acknowledged to have power over 
the dead. It was given to him and him alone to be their sole 
magistrate, to mete out judgment and to decide the fate of all 
souls in (and yet to come to) the Shadowlands.

He took the seven signs and placed them into a huge iron 
tablet, which he set up in the Shadowlands. By their author-
ity he created the cornerstone for a new city to be the center 
of civilization in the Underworld. He took the ghosts of the 
strongest stones from great cities that had gone before — from 
Memphis  and  Babylon,  Jericho,  Sparta  and  Athens  —  to 

construct a fortress on the Isle of Sorrows. In the center of his 
new city, atop the highest point of its seven peaks, he raised 
a towering lighthouse. It shone forth as a beacon of hope and 
safety for all souls, and as a monument to Charon for the great 
deeds he had accomplished. This grand, new city, founded upon 
seven hills on the Isle of Sorrows, was called Stygia.

The Republic of Stygia 

As the acknowledged leader of the Restless and bearer of 
the Shining Ones’ mandate to be their judge, Charon instituted 
the first government of the Restless Dead. Formed using the 
model of the Roman Republic, so eagerly described by the newly 
dead, the Republic of Stygia had a Senate that held seven seats, 
which Charon filled with his most trusted lieutenants. Each 
senator was granted control over a different part of the land 
of the dead, with Charon taking the humble title of Consul. 

As  their  first  act,  the  Senate  granted  lands  to  Shining 
Ones  near  the  docks  of  the  Sunless  Sea.  There,  they  might 
build temples to act as refuges for the dead waiting to journey 
to the Far Shores. 

They also received emissaries from other, faraway kingdoms 
that ruled over their dead as Stygia ruled over the European 
ones. These were known as Dark Kingdoms — that of Asia, 
which the Stygians called the Dark Kingdom of Jade, and that 
of Africa, which they dubbed the Dark Kingdom of Ivory. In 
turn, these ambassadors dubbed Stygia the Dark Kingdom of 
Iron. Charon and the Senate met frequently with the Ivory 
Queen, ruler of the African Underworld, and with ministers 
of the Jade Emperor, discussing common needs, problems, and 
negotiations among them.
The Golden Age

In  the  Skinlands,  Rome  became  a  great  empire  under 
the Caesars. In like fashion, Stygia grew into a Republic with 
Charon at the helm. From its beginnings as a tiny outpost to its 
incarnation as a massive citadel built to defy Oblivion, Stygia 
matured into a just, strong republic over the next few centuries. 
Those times became known as Stygia’s Golden Age.

As decreed by the Lady of Fate, Charon took a tithe from 
all  of  the  dead  who  entered  the  Shadowlands.  He  gave  the 
tithes to Nhudri for the smith to create the first weapons and 
armor forged in Stygia, gear that would be given to those who 
would defend the city. Nhudri then created three very special 
and important projects with the tithe-ore he smelted: Siklos 
— Charon’s blade which he used as his rod of office, Lumen 
—  Charon’s  lantern  used  to  illumine  the  central  beacon  at 
the heart of the city, and the Masks of the Senators. When he 
created the masks, he took from each a small piece to create 
Charon’s mask. The last was a symbolic gesture, to show the 
Senators and all the dead that Charon was a part of them and 
they, in turn, a part of him.

Charon enlisted Nhudri’s help in a further grand project, 
the building of a network of roads that cut through the Tempest 

30

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

and led to the Sunless Sea. As Oblivion grew and fractured the 
Shadowlands  with  its  Spectres,  Charon  fought  it  by  creating 
the roadways webbing the realm to provide secure passage from 
all corners of the Underworld. As Rome’s legions spread in the 
Skinlands, Charon directed Nhudri to follow them — to Britain, 
Gaul, Thrace, Jerusalem, Damascus, Iberia and Egypt — to all 
the lands Rome conquered and made parts of their empire. Ro-
man foot soldiers who died in the battles to conquer these far-off 
places became soldiers in the Stygian ranks. 
Lux Veritatis

The Lady of Fate impressed upon Charon the idea that 
Oblivion must be fought on every front, not just on the field 
of battle, but also with the mind and heart. With that as his 
goal, Charon made his second pronouncement as Consul: Lux 
Veritatis,  or  the  Light  of  Truth.  By  it,  Stygia  undertook  the 
collection and preservation of humanity’s greatest works. All 
were bidden to collect the finest art and sculpture, the great-
est  works  and  thoughts  and  philosophies  of  mankind,  and 
beautiful treasures wherever they might be found. These were 
brought to the imperial city, archived and stored deep beneath 
the Senate in vaults made especially for the purpose. By this 
doctrine, Charon hoped to preserve the beauty and wisdom of 
the ages so that they might be an inspiration to all within the 
Republic. They might be lost to the living, but the dead would 
never feel their lack
The Decline 

The Republic and its great city of Stygia were the Under-
world’s mirror to the grandeur that was Rome. It served as the 
waypoint and guarantor for all those seeking Transcendence and 
protection against Oblivion. Yet as Rome declined, its attackers 
and malcontents fell and arrived in Stygia. There, they refused 
to accept defeat or to bow to Charon’s rule, instead spreading 
out along the Byways and attacking Ferrymen and their charges.
This left many innocent souls to fend for themselves against 
the  Spectres,  who  found  them  easy  prey.  These  malcontent 
scavengers  became  known  as  the  Renegades.  In  response, 
Charon instituted a band of cavalry called Equitaes. These death 
knights were empowered to escort the Ferrymen’s caravans of 
souls and to patrol the thoroughfares, clearing them of both 
Spectres and wolfs-heads. 

Despite these efforts, discontent was growing among the 
dead. When Rome fell into decrepitude, that great empire also 
faced a new challenge in the form of the followers of Christ. 
Stygia followed the pattern, finding itself stretched thin govern-
ing and protecting the countless souls in their care.

The followers of Christ among the Restless, calling them-
selves Fishers, came to the edge of the Sunless Sea and made 
their  own  vessels  from  flotsam  they  collected  there.  They 
turned down the Ferrymen’s offer of guidance and set off for 
a place they called “Paradise.” This Far Shore was not known 
to Charon or any of the Ferrymen, though the Fishers seemed 
certain they would find it. 

THE STEEDS OF THE SHADOWLANDS

Though animal souls do not normally come 
to the Shadowlands, Charon found and bent to 
his will the great black stallions found along the 
fens of the River of Death. Tamed in antiquity by 
Charon, they have served for hundreds of years 
as mounts for the Deathlords and the Equitaes. 
They do not eat or sleep, and nobody knows how 
they sustain themselves. What is known is that 
they are swift beyond telling, fierce in combat, 
and utterly loyal to their chosen rider.

 At least one wraith scholar claims that the 
horses sprang from earthly horses of noted fame 
— horses like Alexander the Great’s Bucephalus, 
an enormous, black stallion noted for his bravery 
and  fierceness,  and  Caligula’s  horse  Incitatus 
that the emperor threatened to make a Roman 
consul. Whether this hypothesis holds truth is 
still a matter of some debate, but what is known 
is this: There are still wild horses running free 
along the river’s banks, and with Charon gone, 
woe betide any who tries to tame them. 

The Fall of the Republic

In the Skinlands, Rome teetered on the brink, buffeted by 
increasing social pressures, mad rulers, and invading barbarians. 
In like manner the unrest in the Shadowlands took the form of 
increasing numbers of Spectres fanning out across every corner 
of the Underworld, leaving destruction, hatred and the siren 
call to Oblivion in their wake. They crossed over into the world 
of the living and turned to Skinriding the barbarian tribes as 
they attacked Rome and its holdings. Upon their deaths, the 
barbarians  arrived  in  the  Shadowlands  and  continued  their 
assaults against what they saw as another Rome — Stygia. 

They swarmed against the city as they had once invaded 
Rome. Roaring behind them came armies of Spectres, ferociously 
attacking all they encountered. In response, Equitaes were sum-
moned to defend Stygia and the Ferrymen took up arms against 
the marauders. Charon took up Siklos, taking the field of battle 
with his Legionnaires, cutting wide swaths through the enemy 
ranks. Though they turned aside the invaders, many Legion-
naires were lost and the Spectres settled into a siege of Stygia.
At just such a point of conflict, in the year 476 AD, Rome 
finally fell. Great temples, government buildings, and places of 
learning were razed or burned, the people killed, beaten down 
or enslaved. These buildings and the Restless who filled them 
suddenly  appeared  in  the  Shadowlands,  creating  even  more 
chaos and stressing the abilities of the Ferrymen to ferry all the 

SETTING

new souls to safety and the Far Shores. There were simply too 
many new arrivals, and too many soldiers and Ferrymen had 
been lost in the struggle to protect Stygia.

The First Great Maelstrom

Madness ruled the Underworld as the battles raged. At the 
height of the pressure a great bellowing sound roared forth from 
deep within the Labyrinth. At Charon’s command, his sentries 
rang huge warning gongs to alert the dead to coming disaster. 
Vainly,  Stygia  tried  to  prepare  as  the  First  Great  Maelstrom 
broke upon them like a fiery hurricane. Howling, scouring winds 
accompanied wave upon wave of fiery tsunami. The isle itself 
cracked and boiled, tearing great rents into the very stone and 
shaking structures to their core. 

The storm, the first to earn the name “Great Maelstrom,” 
left Stygia in shambles. On the coattails of the great storm, 
Spectres attacked the Isle of Sorrows and none were able to 
prevent them from breaching the walls. What was not already 
broken, burnt, or smashed into rubble the Spectres burned and 
pillaged. Razing monuments, temples, and mansions alike, they 
ran amok as the city fell around them. They even ransacked 
Charon’s palace, the Onyx Tower. 

Charon was not there to confront them, as he had taken 
the field with his Ferrymen to drive back the hellish forces of 
Oblivion. By the sheerest margin, Stygia’s defenders triumphed. 
Yet their victory rang hollow. 

The cruel destruction wrought by the storm left massive 
pyres in the broken husk of the once-glorious city. The River 
of Death lay choked and dammed, its polluted waters overflow-
ing its banks. The roads that had once webbed all points of the 
Shadowlands to departure points on the Sunless Sea lay cracked 
and broken, their lengths smeared with acrid refuse vomited up 
by the storm. The Ferrymen were all but destroyed, the Senate 
crushed, and the Restless Dead left huddling like frightened 
children awaiting further attacks. The Republic was gone.
Resurrection

Surrounded by the remains of the great dream of Stygia, 
Charon once again took up the task of rebuilding. He swore he 
would renew the city, creating a stronger, more brilliant Stygia 
than the first. He would take the dead bones of his Republic 
and construct a mightier citadel where the Restless would find 
safety and peace. Rising above the despair, he and his lieuten-
ants took up the broken and battered stones of the old Stygia. 
They created a new citadel of hope patterned after new empires 
from the living world. But they built upon the foundations of 
the old Republic, in keeping with the words of the Lady of Fate.
From the Caesars, Charon took the idea of calling himself 
emperor. His seven remaining senators were now called Death-
lords. Each Deathlord was made the steward of a different group 
of souls. Souls were sent to each Deathlord according to the 
manner of their deaths, and that master was given authority 
over them. Thus, different Deathlords oversaw the elderly, the 

sick, the victims of violence, those slain by nature, and those 
caught up in war. These became the Legions — each made up 
of the souls sharing a particular kind of death. Seven of the 
Legions were led by the Deathlord to whom they were given. 
The Lady of Fate led the eighth. Each Deathlord wore a mask 
to symbolize their new role; instead of an individual wraith, 
each  was  now  the  guardian  of  many,  the  walking  symbol  of 
how they had entered the afterlife.

In time, “Deathlord” became the title of the job rather than 
a specific individual. Some Deathlords are centuries old; others 
have changed with new wraiths taking over from a previous 
one. To most wraiths, however, it is the office — and the Legion 
that serves it — that matters. 
The Ferrymen Rebel

Not all were enthralled with Charon’s new title. The Fer-
rymen were outraged that he would put on such airs as to call 
himself an emperor and refused to serve him any longer. Many, 
angry at the loss of their brethren on the battlefield and feeling 
that Charon had truly overstepped his authority as first among 
many resigned their commissions. They refused outright to ferry 
souls to the new Deathlords. 

THE CITY OF DIS

This city is the home and headquarters of the 
Ferrymen. Found within the Tempest, Dis’ origins 
are hidden even from the Boatmen’s Society. The 
Ferrymen  took  the  city  and  fortified  it  against 
Maelstroms. Digging deeper into the Labyrinth 
where it rested, the Ferrymen and their servants 
created hidden tunnels and rooms, then created 
thick Stygian steel doors to bar the way into the 
Labyrinth.  Three  times  those  doors  have  been 
breached  by  enemies  from  below,  but  the  city 
has not fallen to them.

As  the  Boatmen  reclaim  relics  and  arcane 
Artifacts, many of the hidden rooms act as stor-
age for these treasures. Others serve as private 
chambers  for  the  Boatmen  in  residence.  Some 
rooms  are  used  to  initiate  new  Ferrymen  into 
their duties and responsibilities. And more serve 
as forges where robes, lanterns, weapons, and reed 
boats are created from Moliated Spectres for the 
Ferrymen’s use.

It is almost impossible to enter the hidden 
pathways into and through Dis without the con-
sent of the Boatmen’s Society. Innumerable traps 
and diversions dissuade the curious and the hostile 
from easily gaining entrance. This ancient city is 
the sole outpost between the chaotic Tempest and 
the area claimed by Oblivion’s servants.

32

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Furious at what he saw as a repudiation of the Ferrymen’s 
oaths, Charon retaliated by banishing them from the Isle of Sor-
rows and stripping them of their claims and awards. He decreed 
that their names be stricken from all records. He felt that if they 
would not perform their duties, then they would be thrown out to 
fend for themselves alone. Some joined the Renegades, who had 
always refused Charon’s leadership, some left for the Far Shores; 
many, sadly having lost their purpose, surrendered to Oblivion. 
Seeking to stave off further losses, the great and wise among the 
Ferrymen banded together to claim a new city, making it a place 
of refuge where those who bore the lantern and scythe might find 
new purpose. They called this place “Dis.”

Rebuilding

Over  the  decades,  Stygia  was  slowly  rebuilt.  The  task 
was  interrupted  time  and  again  by  wild,  destructive  storms 
— remnants of the Great Maelstrom that refused to die, and 
periodically  sought  out  Stygia  as  if  guided  there.  Renegades 
built their own hamlets along the river and continually tore 
up the roads or spread discontent. Malicious wraiths pierced 
the Shroud in numerous places and appeared to mortals in the 
guises of demons and devils, demanding tribute and sacrifices. 
Nonetheless, Stygia battled on. 

After centuries of strife, the last of the Spectres vomited up 
by the first Great Maelstrom were destroyed or forced back into 

the Labyrinth. With the surcease of conflict for the moment, 
Charon  stood  forth  to  honor  those  brave  Restless  who  had 
performed their duties and remained firm against the Shadow-
Eaten and the collapse of the Republic. Praising all, including 
those Ferrymen and Equitaes who did not desert Stygia when 
its walls were breached, Charon instituted the Imperial Order 
of the Sickle. Many souls joined the ranks of the militia, hoping 
to one day become members of the prestigious new Order. Even 
today, some members of each Legion may be granted a place 
in the Order for conspicuous bravery, great leadership, or great 
work done to increase their Legion’s success and standing. Aside 
from a coveted place in the Chronicles of the History of the Dark 
Kingdom of Iron, the award confers a few small rewards and minor 
treasures on its holders.

With the brief peace, the dead set about repairing the roads 
and  buildings  destroyed  by  the  Maelstrom.  They  rebuilt  the 
Onyx Tower. As newly dead souls provided a greater workforce 
(not to mention more raw materials for the forge), Nhudri and 
his  apprentices  created  new  structures,  including  a  sea  wall 
around the Isle of Sorrows that would stand against any storm. 
The Fishers Return and the Treaty of Paradise

While  Stygia  was  still  rebuilding,  the  Fishers  returned. 
Their golden ship, used to transport wraiths to the Far Shore 
they called Paradise, was seen just off the Isle of Sorrows. They 

SETTING

33

took on hopeful passengers, then built a magnificent temple 
on one of the hills of the isle itself. Finally, they approached 
Charon,  demanding  that  he  tithe  to  their  temple.  Though 
he heard them out, Charon refused. Arguing that he served 
the Lady of Fate and the whole land of the dead and not any 
particular Far Shore, he made a counterproposal. 

His proposal was accepted and became known as the Treaty 
of  Paradise.  It  called  for  the  Fishers  to  tithe  the  relics  they 
collected, and in return Charon promised to give all incoming 
wraiths who sought Paradise into the Fishers’ care. The treaty 
ushered in a new era of cooperation and order in Stygia, as the 
number of Fishers was ever-growing.
The Hierarchy

In the lands of the Quick, the Crusades caused many 
thousands of wraiths — both Christian and Muslim — to 
enter  the  Shadowlands  from  the  battlefields  and  besieged 
towns as well as from the sickness and starvation that ac-
company war. Though many attempted to continue the wars 
of their living days, they were quickly taught the nature of 
their new state. Most elected to join Nhudri and his follow-
ers in repairing roads, or signed on with the Stygian militia, 
finding common ground with former foes in battling against 
Spectres or Renegades.

As life in the Skinlands changed, Charon remade Stygia 
to reflect the Kingdoms of Europe. He founded the Hierarchy, 
with Charon and his Deathlords at the top. The Legions and 
the  Eqitaes,  now  called  Knights,  were  just  below  that  level, 
along with the Ferrymen who remained loyal to Charon. The 
lowest place was reserved for the equivalent of serfs — wraiths 
called Thralls, who were bound with Stygian steel chains and 
used as slaves or as payment among the higher classes.
The Founding of the Guilds

At this time, many of the ancient organizations of like-
minded wraiths coalesced into Guilds, societies modeled on the 
trade guilds of the living. These Guilds sought to protect and 
grow the knowledge of their particular powers, called Arcanoi, 
and to find ways those powers could be marketed to the populace 
of the city. Hand in hand with that went the responsibility to 
prevent abuses of said powers. Each Guild developed its rites 
and rituals, and many wraiths with any demonstrable power 
signed on, even if the inner circles remained restricted to the 
chosen  few.  Charon  later  claimed  credit  for  organizing  the 
Guilds, a grievance that was remembered when the Guilds later 
revolted. Regardless, the Guilds took a place just below that of 
the Knights and Legions in Wraith society.

During this time, however, discontent continued among 
some of the wraiths who resented Charon, his Hierarchy and 
the Guilds seeking to curtail their free use of their talents. 
These penetrated the Shroud time and again, appearing to 
mortals as demons or devils and demanding tribute or sacri-
fices. To provide legal recourse to stop such practices, Charon 
instituted the Dictum Mortuum.

The Second Great Maelstrom

In the year 1347, the lands of Europe were laid to waste by 
the Black Death, a plague so foul and deadly that entire villages 
and towns were wiped out. Souls began to cross the Shroud in 
such great numbers that the Shadowlands could scarcely hold 
them.  These  miserable  wraiths  massed  together,  the  weep-
ing lesions that were the sign of the plague scarring king and 
commoner alike. Such devastation heralded the arrival of the 
Second Great Maelstorm.

Unlike during the first great storm, Stygia held on. Charon 
and the Hierarchy appeared to the new wraiths, giving them 
assurances that they would fulfill their accustomed roles in the 
Shadowlands as they had while living. Adrift and terrified, the 
huddled masses acquiesced, and Stygia’s numbers were bolstered 
in time for the city’s hour of need.

The true mettle of Nhudri’s work was made clear when 
the great seawall held against the Great Maelstrom’s fury. The 
roads did not crack or burn and the Knights, the Legions, and 
the Fishers’ Crusader-Knights cut down the Spectres that were 
unleashed both quickly and decisively.

So many new wraiths had entered the land of the dead, 
though, that Charon began a census of all his subjects. He then 
took tithes from all to help fund the demands placed on Stygia 
by the unprecedented influx.
The Fishers Revolt 

The leader of the Fishers, known as the Archbishop, was 
gravely angered by the tithe. He met with Charon and demanded 
that the emperor reduce the tithe he asked from the Fishers, 

THE DICTUM MORTUUM: THE CODE OF THE DEAD
In  the  wake  of  the  wraithly  abuses  during 
the so-called Dark Ages, Charon created a code 
formalizing  the  separation  between  living  and 
dead. These laws dictated that no wraith was to 
penetrate the Shroud under any circumstances. 
There was to be no contact with the living, no 
attempt to impart what the future might hold for 
them or to harass or threaten those still living in 
any way. Finally, wraiths were forbidden to suggest 
or compel the Quick to take a life, whether their 
own or any other to facilitate passing over into 
the land of the dead.

As one might expect, the Dictum Mortuum 
was immediately honored more in the breach than 
in the observance. To this day, the Legions spend 
an inordinate amount of wraithpower policing 
Dictum Mortuum violations, pursuing everyone 
from heartbroken wraiths seeking to reach out to 
their loved ones to hardened poltergeists-for-hire.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

since they now represented the largest single group of wraiths 
in  Stygia.  They  had  become  so  powerful  that  they  not  only 
commanded their own temple in the outskirts of Stygia, but 
their own Crusader-Knights and Death-Bishops. 

Charon knew they represented a threat to himself and his 
Hierarchy and that they had not been entirely truthful when 
recruiting wraiths to their ranks. Rather than reducing the de-
mand, Charon ordered that the Crusader-Knights be disbanded 
and doubled the tithe on the Fishers.

For months the Fishers’ temple stood dark, with bands of 
Crusader-Knights  patrolling  its  grounds  and  defying  Charon’s 
order to disband. Then, as if by some unseen signal, as one they 
formed up and mounted a lightning raid on the Onyx Tower 
itself. The palace guard was warned of their coming by one of the 
Crusaders, who saw his own companions’ actions as arrogant and 
treasonous. The fully prepared palace knights had fortified the 
tower and overthrew the Fisher troops, stripping them of their 
mounts and placing those they routed in chains. The rebels were 
taken to the great lighthouse, where their chains were set alight. 
The prisoners’ bodies burned there for all to see for seven days.
Victorius, Charon and his forces entered the great temple. 
There they found untold stores of treasures that the Fishers had 
promised  to  tithe  unto  Charon  but  had  instead  hoarded  for 
themselves. The direct violation of the Treaty of Paradise greatly 
angered Charon, and he sent his most trusted Knights to the 
Far Shores to speak with the Shining Ones who dwelled there.
The Great Evacuation

Charon issued an order that all Shining Ones who resided 
on the Isle of Sorrows were to depart for the Far Shores with 
the next tide. They were no longer welcome in Stygia. At the 
sounding of the great gong signaling the changing of the tide, 
all the Shining Ones set forth in any skiff, raft, or ship they 
could commandeer, taking with them as much as they could 
carry. Silhouetted by the flames that devoured their temples, 
Charon watched the rag-tag fleet until it vanished out of sight. 
Heretics 

The  Knights  that  Charon  sent  across  the  sea  returned, 
bringing the most horrible news Charon could imagine. The 
Far Shores as Charon remembered them were tranquil realms 
where wraiths who crossed the Sunless Sea could find Tran-
scendence. Now the Knights reported that the Shining Ones 
had abandoned their duties and the words of Charon and the 
Lady of Fate and were forcing continual obedience from those 
who were under them. Many souls were bound in torment or 
herded into pens and ignored. For centuries, the wraiths trapped 
there  had  been  denied  Transcendence  by  the  ones  Charon 
trusted to help them. Many of the Shining Ones were some of 
the first Ferrymen who betrayed him and the souls they were 
supposed to protect for their own greed and power. Depressed 
and bitter, Charon retired to his chambers and was not seen for 
weeks. Many feared he had fallen to Oblivion from the blow.

The Proclamation of Reason

After  weeks  of  deliberation,  Charon  appeared  on  his 
balcony. He spoke not to the Deathlords, but to the citizenry 
of Stygia, delivering the Proclamation of Reason. It declared 
that the Shining Ones had broken their compact to shepherd 
souls to Transcendence, abusing and tormenting those in their 
care and no longer standing against Oblivion. Further, they had 
lied to, deceived, and enticed souls to join their ranks to foster 
their own power and as such, they and their ilk were henceforth 
damned for all eternity. He named them as Heretics, who led 
souls away from the true light, and proclaimed Stygia would 
no longer give them audience, safe passage, or any assistance. 
From that day forward he pledged that Stygia would seek to 
bring about their eradication. 
The Council of Inquisitors

To  enforce  his  decree,  Charon  formed  the  Magisterium 
Veritatus, or Council of Inquisitors. Taking as their model the 
Catholic Church’s Inquisition in Europe, its members and agents 
were sent out to root out and destroy any pockets of Heretics 
and  their  influences.  The  militant  branch  of  the  Council 
took the name the Order of the Unlidded Eye to remind all of 
their eternal and unsleeping vigilance in their duties. To the 
populace, however, they became known as the Grim Riders as 
they patrolled the roads and the River of Death searching for 
incautious Heretics.

Charon did not forbid individual souls from trying to find 
their own way to the Far Shores, nor were these seekers held 
as Heretics for doing so. But without maps or guides, they had 
little chance of making it across the Sunless Sea.
Stygia Besieged

Surrounded on all sides by unrest and enemies, Stygia took 
on the atmosphere of a city under siege. Renegades lived beyond 
the city walls and harassed the few Ferrymen still performing 
their duties. Heretics whispered their doctrines in the ears of 
wraiths already distrustful of Charon’s new policies. Fearing the 
Inquisition’s  ever-watchful  eye,  neighbors  turned  in  friends, 
kin, and anyone else whom they thought suspicious, branding 
them Heretics and throwing them to the Grim Riders to keep 
themselves above suspicion. 

Only those who were foolhardy or crazed ventured from 
the city. Soul-trade slowed to a crawl and no ships left port 
for the Far Shores. Soul upon soul crowded into the dubi-
ous safety of Stygia’s walls, packing in so tightly as to line 
the walls with cowering wraiths. From this pressure-cooker 
atmosphere arose events known as the Three Abominations. 
One began from outside the city, the next was internal, and 
the last was far away, yet so horrid it scarred the souls not 
only of those who took part, but also of those who merely 
heard of it.

SETTING

35

The First Abomination: The Looting of the Artifacts

Early  in  the  16th  century,  Renegades  massed  along  the 
river delta and stormed Stygia’s walls. Charon and his Knights 
met the assault, but the panic that overtook the city allowed 
the attackers to breach the Onyx Tower and raid its Artifacts, 
among them the Spear of Longinus, the lance reputedly used 
to pierce Christ’s side at his death. Many great treasures, stored 
in the tower under the practice of Lux Veritatis and considered 
to be the property of all the souls of Stygia, were looted and 
carried away. Their value as great works of art and truth, and 
their ability to inspire and impassion those who looked upon 
them, lay trampled under the greed to own treasures with no 
thought to their purpose of enlightening the populace. All would 
have been lost if the Knights had not made the ultimate effort; 
many of their best and most trusted sacrificed themselves to 
thwart the Renegades, and pushed them out of the tower and 
beyond the city’s walls.
The Second Abomination: The Breaking of the Guilds

The second abomination came from within Stygia’s walls. 
Reading the unrest and fear of the populace in the wake of the 
assault, certain Guildmasters revolted and attempted to wrest 
control of Stygia from Charon and his Deathlords. In the year 
1598, the Guilds struck. Despite uniting themselves in the at-
tempt, the always quarrelsome and jealous Guilds ultimately 
failed to coordinate and fell to Charon’s forces. Scores of Guild-
wraiths were destroyed. Included among the fallen were Nhudri’s 
original three apprentices, wraiths who had helped to build the 
roads of the empire. It is said that Nhudri no longer plied the 
forges quite so willingly after that loss, but only Nhudri and 
Charon knew the truth of it.
The Third Abomination: The Flaying of Obsidian

In the Land of the Quick, Europeans began an age of ex-
ploration. Mariners sailed across the Atlantic to the new world, 
finding new lands and discovering new races. They returned to 
their homelands with rich and exotic gifts, which whetted the 
appetites of Europe’s monarchs and peoples for more.

Charon and his Deathlords heard the stories of these ex-
plorations and sent emissaries across the Tempest, where they 
found a whole new kingdom, a Dark Kingdom of Obsidian as 
Stygia was a Dark Kingdom of Iron. Ruling the wraiths in the 
new world was a leader named Ix Chel.

The official story holds that Heretics and Renegades fleeing 
the Inquisition came to those foreign lands skinriding crews 
from Iberian ports. It is doubtful that no Stygian wraiths joined 
them, as pressures in the Dark Kingdom of Iron continued to 
build. The crews housing the skinriders fell into hate and fear 
of these strange new people and the wraiths within descended 
upon the Obsidian lands. 

Their Shadows grew uncontrollable as they made war upon 
the Obsidian wraiths. But it was the wraiths themselves, and not 

their Shadows, that commanded the devastation and murder. 
There followed decades of savage violence, piling slaughter and 
desecration atop larceny and pillaging. Reports of the savagery 
unleashed on the Obsidian wraiths finally reached Charon and 
the Deathlords. But before they could gather a force to cross the 
Tempest, the violence stopped. All was silence. Ix Chel and his 
people had been massacred, hurled into Oblivion by the invaders. 
Their kingdom was totally destroyed in this third abomination, 
which became known as the Flaying.

Emissaries returned with horrified stories of the utter an-
nihilation of an entire kingdom from the Shadowlands. The 
Heretics had committed their most heinous crime, obliterating 
an entire world. 

The Third Great Maelstrom

The Three Abominations built one upon another until the 
Shadowlands could take no more. The earth itself screamed as 
it cracked and shook. Lightning blazed across the skies, striking 
where it willed. Storms of fire and whirlwinds of ice raged across 
the land, all borne on a wind that howled of despair. The Third 
Great Maelstrom had been born, and its righteous wrath made 
those that came before it seem like the lightest of summer rains. 
From the maw of Oblivion, great stinking clouds of grave 
dust billowed forth, covering Stygia, choking the Great River, 
and plunging the city into darkness. The maddened Tempest 
overflowed everywhere, separating Stygia from the rest of the 
Shadowlands.

The  empire  was  torn  and  all  but  swallowed  up  when  a 
brilliant nephwrack general named Coldheart led divisions of 
Spectres up from the Labyrinth. They feasted on the hatred 
and  fear  fostered  by  Renegade,  Heretic,  and  Hierarch  alike 
and swarmed the River of Death, leaving behind a fear-choked, 
impassable  river  that  even  the  bravest  Ferrymen  dared  not 
travel  alone.  Though  the  surviving  paths  were  cracked  and 
stained with the atrocities, greed, and cruelty the wraiths of 
the kingdom had wrought, Ferrymen chose to sojourn down 
the roads that were left, called by their duty. The landscape 
they traveled in was dark and stinking, oily with the effluvia 
and slime of the Tempest. 

In the wake of the Maelstrom, the Shroud thickened and 
grew. Wraiths seeking to cross it were rebuffed, and the Dictum 
Mortuum suddenly became more than just a joke.
Renewal and Industry

Once again taking his cue from the advances in the Land of 
the Living, Charon emerged from the Onyx Tower and moved 
among the wraiths of Stygia, bolstering optimism and expressing 
the desire to recover and rise to greatness once again. To gain 
advantages over Stygia’s enemies, Charon ordered that every 
freewraith — those bound to Charon since the demands he made 
after the second abomination — be allowed to carry swords made 
of soulsteel. They were symbols of these wraiths’ allegiance and 
also weapons to fight Oblivion wherever it was found.

36

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

In  addition,  he  personally  scoured  the  streets  of  Stygia 
searching for and taking into custody layabouts, wastrels, and 
those without strong Passions. As they were undistinguished 
in life, so he would make them in death. 

Industry swept Europe and as it did, Charon bound these 
wraiths and made Thralls of them, slaves to labor in mining 
the death ore of the Veinous Stair. These materials were sent 
to Kyklos to be forged into machinery for the empire. When 
those Thralls were too worn out to continue serving, he kept 
them from Oblivion’s grasp by having them forged into neces-
sary items.

Many felt that Charon’s cavalier actions in enslaving the 
weak was a heinous and callous act. And so it was. His reason-
ing for doing so was to keep them from being taken by Spectres 
or dragged to Oblivion where their souls would strengthen the 
enemy’s darkness rather than serve Stygia, but many were not 
convinced by this logic. Still, fed by the forges, the Stygian 
economy roared to life and prosperity. 
The First Necropolis

The  Third  Great  Maelstrom  changed  the  lands  around 
Stygia forever. The River of Death, once a swift-flowing stream, 
now ran sluggishly, choked and impassable. The grand bridges 

that had linked Stygia with the far parts of the Shadowlands 
lay twisted and broken. Charon saw the need for cities to be 
founded outside of Stygia. Here the influx of new souls could 
be gathered to shield them from the horrors lurking within the 
Tempest. Further, another city would give Stygia some relief 
from its unmanageable numbers engorging and pushing against 
its distended walls. 

Charon approached the Legions to build a City of the Dead 
on the borders of the lands of the living, a Necropolis which 
would be a protected place for newly arriving Restless. They 
responded by constructing the first Necropolis, located in the 
burgeoning city of London. Heretics and Renegades attempted 
to destroy the fledgling city, but their forays against the Legions 
proved useless. The powerful Legions fiercely routed all attacks, 
swatting away those fools who sought to harm the Necropolis. 
The Citadel soon became the bastion of the empire and other 
cities grew and took shape: Rome, Paris, then spreading across 
the whole of the Shadowlands.

The Fifth Legion was tasked with creating a Necropolis in 
the New World. Their efforts yielded New Amsterdam where 
they again fought off Heretic, Renegade and whatever foul trash 
was left from the Third Maelstrom. Other Legionnaires came 
to cleanse the Shadowlands nearby and founded Necropoli at

Philadelphia and Boston. Others soon followed. As they grew, 
the Necropoli became clearing houses for souls. 
The Age of Industry

The souls collected in the Necropoli were herded onto great 
transports and sent to the Deathlords, who divided and claimed 
them according to the manner in which they died. As science 
and industry informed life in the Skinlands, the Shadowlands 
profited when great thinkers, scientists, and industrialists died 
and brought their talents to Stygia. The City’s façade changed 
again as it opened to engines and wheeled transports, to “boom 
sticks” and other discoveries.

Great  iron  ships,  used  to  carry  cargos  of  souls  from  the 
Necropoli  to  Stygia,  were  built  at  new  ports  on  the  Isle  of 
Sorrows.  What  were  once  the  temples  of  the  Shining  Ones 
became industrial foundries, turning out the behemoth vessels 
at a phenomenal rate.

As industry became the new way of life in the lands of the 
Quick, the people changed. Many forsook the faiths of their 
fathers and the craftsmanship and artistry of creation for new 
deities and doctrines: science, reason, mass production, and the 
mightiest — money. These people died without strong Passions. 
Their shades passed through the Shroud and flitted aimlessly 
through the Shadowlands, easy targets for Oblivion’s minions. 
Soon the Veinous Stair swarmed with these newly taken 
Thralls laboring to mine the death ore there. From dull, meaning-
less existences, the Thralls were condemned to dull, meaningless 
annihilation. And when their usefulness was done, the forges 
glowed as their drained Corpora were smelted.

Each advancement of Stygia was also costly as the Shroud 
thickened and thickened again, becoming largely impenetrable. 
Wraiths now existed as virtual prisoners, unable to visit the 
Skinlands. Charon visited the few portals to the Land of the 
Quick where he caught new wraiths, whose strong ties to the 
world above gave them the ability to break the Shroud. These he 
immediately made into members of the Hierarchy in Necropoli 
where their ties would be protected.
The Fading

Charon decided to travel the Shadowlands to see for himself 
how things fared. But as he reached the realm separated from 
Stygia  by  the  Tempest  he  began  to  fade.  The  great  Charon 
was discorporating. Realizing the danger, he quickly returned 
to Stygia. He told no one of this except a very few loyal In-
quisitors. Those, he charged with finding out the cause. While 
they searched, other highly placed Hierarchs found themselves 
similarly confined. Deathlords, Legionnaires, and even Ferrymen 
began fading as they neared the Shadowlands. 

True  to  their  mission,  the  Inquisitors  found  the  cause: 
Charon’s Fetters had been destroyed, as had those of the other 
highly placed officials. Mighty though he was, Charon could 
not even visit the Shadowlands or watch over those he was 
sworn to protect. 

38

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The  Deathlords  immediately  began  squabbling  among 
themselves. Each accused another of conspiracy, of deliberately 
destroying the other’s Fetters to weaken him. Every Deathlord 
feared the others, bickering and desperately hoarding whatever 
each had, fighting to become more powerful. The Legionnaires, 
frustrated  at  it  all,  blamed  the  Heretics  and  Renegades  and 
began brutal pogroms to annihilate them.
The Second Descent

In what became known as the Second Descent, Charon, 
mighty Emperor of Stygia, locked himself away from his sub-
jects, retiring into the solitude of the Onyx Tower. He issued 
no statements or commands, nor did he respond to the citizens 
who gathered outside his home night and day to implore him 
to return. In his absence, the Deathlords became the rulers of 
the empire. They cooperated enough to claim right of rule over 
the Necropoli, which continued to supply souls to Stygia, but 
for most purposes became self-autonomous cities.

Without Charon’s direct leadership, the Deathlords acted 
as petty tyrants. They seemed unwilling or unable to form an 
effective government. They squabbled and wasted opportuni-
ties. They changed their minds to reflect whatever whim took 
their  fancy.  Worse,  they  became  hucksters,  bargaining  and 
promising Transcendence just to gain more souls on their side, 
though there was already a system to divide the souls fairly. 
Stygia began to rot from the inside as wraiths lost their sense 
of meaning and continuity.
The Great Influx 

August 1, 1914. The countries of Europe started a great war 
that would become known as World War I. The Citadels of the 
Shadowlands received whole divisions of soldiers and victims 
whose bodies were scarred and torn by bayonets, choked by 
mustard gas, or riddled with machine gun fire. They spoke of 
deathfields called Galipoli or Ypres or the Somme.

Herded onto “railed carriages,” the new Restless journeyed 
from the Necropoli of France and the Low Countries to Stygia. 
The Hierarchy processed this constant flow as best they could, 
though the walls of Stygia could hold no more. Great bridges 
were constructed, long structures of Stygian iron that rose above 
the city’s walls to reach the Iron Hills. There enormous towers 
were erected to house the new Restless. They became massive 
barracks of the dead.

The Fourth Great Maelstrom

The  shock  of  those  newly  dead  along  with  the  hellish 
influx of so many Restless caused another titanic Maelstrom, 
the  fourth.  The  hell  winds  of  Oblivion  whipped  across  the 
Shadowlands. During the storm, the Deathlords fled to their 
Citadels, huddling and hiding from its fury. 

Great hailstones and torrents of effluvia-filled rain lashed 
Stygia, the Necropoli, and the new towers and bridges. Screams 
of Spectres who rode the demon winds froze hearts and drove 
some insane. But the city held. When all was over, those emerg-

THE DOOMSLAYERS

Aside  from  hunting  down  Spectres,  the 
Doomslayers took up other duties as well, from 
mapping out the Labyrinth to watching for signs 
of a higher-up member of the Hierarchy falling to 
his Shadow or being replaced by a doppelganger. 
Some even say that they are searching for ways 
to  reverse  or  redeem  Spectres  from  Oblivion’s 
venom.

Though they have suffered downturns, they 
have  also  known  great  triumphs  in  their  chal-
lenges as explorers of the Labyrinth and Spectre 
hunters.  Such  an  existence  is  very  demanding 
both physically and mentally, as their constant 
readiness  and  closeness  to  Oblivion’s  creatures 
forces them to contend with their own potent 
Shadows on a daily basis. They are always aware 
that if they are unlucky or careless, they might 
even become the very creatures they hunt. There 
are currently five divisions of Doomslayers, each 
with its own special missions. 

ing from whatever shelter they had found discovered that the 
fury of the winds lashed the towers and structures of Stygia, 
polishing them to a mirror-like brilliance.
Necropoli Invaded and the Great Depression

Stygia survived the Maelstrom, but the Necropoli did not 
fare as well. Spectres following in the wake of the winds located 
the new roads to the various Citadels in the Shadowlands. They 
managed to infiltrate them, moving among the populace. Once 
inside, they smashed through the Shroud to Skinride mortals in 
many cities of the Quick. Spectres infested New York, Chicago, 
and other large cities where they gleefully encouraged crime 
and murder. 

Whole sections of mortal cities played host to the battles 
among Spectres as they sought to kill off their rivals or gain 
more influence. Massacres of whole families occurred. Some 
even battled in their human “skins,” killing one another and 
being  killed  so  they  could  experience  the  death  and  misery 
they caused.

Further causing chaos in the Skinlands was the collapse 
of the merchant houses of Europe and America as bank after 
bank went under in the years following World War I. The lands 
were thrown down into the Great Depression, which forced 
bankruptcy on the rich, destitution on the working class and 
destruction on the truly needy. People lost their cars and houses, 
whole families were broken apart as desperate people sought 
any work they could get. Misery and hunger stalked the land 
and, as if in mockery of the Great Maelstrom, great dust storms

stripped the land of its vitality. Spectres cackled and capered 
at the sorrows they had wrought.
Charon Emerges

At last, Charon emerged from his self-imposed exile. He 
studied the state of the empire and noted the chaos and destruc-
tion wrought by the Maelstrom. He was especially troubled 
by the Spectres, who still ran amok in the Necropoli and in 
the mortal world. Calling together a group of independent 
wraiths who had helped defend Stygia from the Maelstrom 
and  any  other  that  would  agree  to  hunt  down  and  destroy 
Spectres, he formed them into a group called the Doomslayers. 
Their mission gave them the recognition of the Hierarchy, 
though they were not an official part of it. Charon proposed 
that they become bounty hunters, hunting down and killing 
Spectres wherever they were found and bringing back proof 
of their demise. 
World War II and The War of the Dead

Though the Doomslayers and others were doing their best 
to curtail the spectral hordes, those evil beings still wormed their 
way into the politics and lives of the Quick. Spectres tinkered 
with  their  invisible  influences  and  whispered  lies,  spewing 
hatred  and  violence  into  the  ears  of  malcontents  across  the 
earth. The fragile peace enforced by the victors of the Great 
War tottered on the precipice. 

In the lands of the living, one called Hitler rose to promi-
nence by playing upon his peoples’ insecurities, wounded pride 
and distrust, even hatred, of outsiders and those whose practices 
they abhorred. For too long the rest of Europe looked on and 
none stood forth to stop his aggression. Finally, Hitler plunged 
Germany into another all-consuming war as the Spectres danced 
and clapped at the new slaughter to come.

Again the battlefields filled with thousands upon thousands 
of dead, their souls as newly minted wraiths swallowed up by the 
Necropoli and sent on their way to Stygia. Again, the wounds 
upon them, whether from bullet or grenade, showed the manner 
of their deaths. Those who did not fight also arrived — torn, 
blown apart, raped, starved, or smashed almost into pulp by the 
bombs dropped on their cities. 

As bad as the civilian dead seemed, sent to their doom by 
the exigencies of war, even that was not the worst. First as a 
trickle and then a torrent, the wraiths of the people of Abraham 
inundated the Shadowlands. People arrived naked, their death 
marks proclaiming them as victims of poisoning or asphyxia-
tion. Along with them came those Hitler also deemed unfit: 
Romani, homosexuals, intellectuals, the mentally ill, physically 
disabled, and clergy, as well as many Soviet prisoners of war. 
Not only men, but women, children, grandparents, newborn 
babes — all arrived with shaved heads, and while those who 
were  processed  at  the  Nazi  death  camps  and  immediately 
killed were mostly able, others arrived with bellies distended 
on stick-like figures from long starvation, their bodies marked 
with numbered tattoos and worked to exhaustion. All bore a 

stench that could not be mistaken for anything else, the sickly 
sweet stink of burnt meat. 

War blazed across the Pacific as well as Europe. Attacks 
were made upon certain Necropoli and in retaliation Charon 
launched enormous warships made of Stygian iron that sailed 
the Tempest and clashed with the jade ships of the Dark King-
dom of Jade. The Tempest became choked with the bodies of 
these ships in a contest to lay claim to the Stygian souls who 
died thousands of miles from their homelands. Such reclaimed 
victims were delivered to the great city and Charon’s care. Ships 
clashed and burned, and shells screamed through the skies of 
the Tempest as each side sought to conquer the other. 

The Fifth Great Maelstrom

The Second World War raged for many years across Europe, 
Africa, and Asia. It ended finally when the United States created 
a new weapon that wrought destruction on the building blocks 
of matter itself. Though the people in charge claimed that the 
new weapon would be used to save their soldiers’ lives, many 
believed that having created such a horror, those responsible 
were too fascinated by its possibilities not to see what it could do.
Accordingly,  the  new  atomic  bombs  were  used  on  two 
Japanese cities: Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When they exploded, 
the concussion, roar, and shock penetrated even through the 
Shroud and into the Shadowlands. Flames like those caused 
by  a  million  suns  burst  over  the  underworld  for  the  briefest 
moment, blinding all who saw them. 

The Labyrinth itself screamed like a wounded beast and split 
open. In doing so, it vomited forth the Fifth Great Maelstrom, 
far greater than any that had come before. The storm thundered 
across the skies, releasing blistering heat and pressure so intense 
that any caught in the blast were blown straight to Oblivion.
Thousands of smaller Maelstroms were loosed in its wake. 
These spread across the Shadowlands, sucking souls into the 
darkness below and making travel impossible, whether by ship 
or rail or road. The Necropoli became outposts cut off from 
one another and from Stygia as swarms of Spectres attacked 
the Citadels. They became islands, harboring any wraiths they 
could find and desperately fighting for survival. Many fell; none 
were unscathed.
Gorool and the Third Descent

As the Fifth Great Maelstrom responded to the perversion 
of life by shaking loose the Labyrinth itself, it released a horrid 
and deadly creature from its bowels. An ancient Malfean known 
as Gorool arose from the depths of the Tempest. Its beastly fangs 
and claws, great strength, and lashing tail smashed Charon’s 
warships to splinters, breaking them like children’s toys as it 
devoured entire crews. 

Charon called upon the Deathlords and Necropoli for help 
in bringing the giant down before it could destroy the whole of 
Stygia, but not one came. None would leave his seat of power 
and risk it being taken over by another. In the end, and in his

WHENCE GOROOL?

There are those in Stygia who have grown 
obsessed with the mystery of Gorool’s appearance. 
Currently popular among them is the theory that 
Gorool was actually Charon’s Shadow, excised 
from him by the Pardoners and given a new and 
independent existence in the Labyrinth. Others 
hold that the beast was the Shadow of the entire 
Dark Kingdom of Iron, the many sins of its long 
existence coming home to roost. And there are 
those  with  even  wilder  theories.  If  there  is  an 
answer to this conundrum, it lies deep within the 
Labyrinth, and no Helldiver has yet discovered it.

last act as Emperor of the Dark Kingdom of Iron, Charon stood 
alone, as he had always from the first moment he had been 
chosen by the Lady of Fate.

Putting aside his mask, he took up his great blade, Siklos. 
He stepped into his reed boat, as he had done so many centuries 
before,  to  face  the  beast  alone.  He  sailed  into  the  Weeping 
Bay, challenged the Malfean and attacked. Back and forth the 
battle raged, until Charon drew the baleful form of the beast 
away from Stygia and its people. In deeper water, they fought 
to a standstill, neither able to best the other. Then Charon, 

fearing that he would weaken before his enemy did, opened a 
great whirlpool. He flung his tiny boat and himself down into it 
with the horrid beast following after him. This became known 
as Charon’s Third Descent.

The whirlpool closed over the two of them. Neither Charon 
nor Gorool emerged from that place in the Sunless Sea where 
they had gone down into the depths.
Aftermath

In the wake of the loss of Charon, Stygia mourned. And 
while Stygia mourned, the Deathlords moved to consolidate 
their power. Speaking as one, they told the populace that they 
would uphold the virtues Charon espoused while seeking to 
avoid the mistakes he made. They praised his valor and love 
for Stygia, while making it clear they remembered his missteps 
as well. And they ended their declaration, their words echoing 
from  behind  their  masks,  with  a  statement  of  purpose:  that 
Stygia would continue. 

Then, they immediately went back to scheming against 

one another.

And as wars and revolutions, plagues and mass murders 
rocked the decades after the second World War, the Deathlords 
took in the souls they regarded as theirs, built up their Legions, 
and  kept  watchful  eyes  on  their  neighbors.  For  the  average 
wraith, it was a time of relative peace and prosperity. But every so 
often the Maelstrom winds blow, or a Necropolis falls, and they 
are reminded that Oblivion does not give up its prey so easily.

Souls and Memories:  
The Economics of the Underworld

retty much everything in the Underworld is 
made of one of two things: souls or memories. 
The bulk of the raw materials are memories, 
relics of destroyed items from the Skinlands 
that made their way across the Shroud and were 
scavenged to feed Stygia’s insatiable appetite. 
Chunks of buildings, cars (wrecked and usable), 
torn-up rail lines, and the asphalt from abandoned highways, all of 
these find their way to the Underworld and, in capable hands, are 
put to use. There’s a reason wraithly architecture looks like it’s made 
from bits and bobs haphazardly welded together; that’s because it 
is. Look at the walls of a Citadel and you might see brick from a 
beloved schoolhouse cheek-by-jowl with concrete buttresses from an 
imploded stadium and steel girders from an old shipyard left to rust. 
But while they may be common materials, they’re not neces-
sarily the strongest, which is why the economy of Stygia really 
runs on something else: souls. Through a process discovered 
by Nhudri, the Great Smith, souls can be transformed by the 
application of hammer and soulfire into inert objects, the raw 
materials of everything from construction to cash. The currency 
of Stygia, the obolus, is a heavy, slate-gray coin made from a 
single soul, melted down and reforged. Souls are not only the 
population of Stygia, they are also its dearest resource, and as 
long as wraiths hunger for the items that can be made from 
them, the forges are always clamoring for more.

To  meet  this  need,  different  wraiths  take  different  ap-
proaches. Some try to bring in Spectres, reasoning that it’s better 
to impress these tainted souls into the fight against Oblivion 
than to allow them to succumb to it. Others hunt Drones, the 
mindless remains of wraiths who stayed too long in their Cauls, 
and turn those in for bounties. Plasmics are always fair game, 
though those who go fishing in the Tempest are as likely to 
end up devoured as they are to come home in triumph. The 
courts of Stygia add to the pile; traitors and criminals are often 
sentenced to the forge, and if later evidence exculpates a since-
forged wraith, it’s too late to do anything about it. 

But the bulk of souls that are fed to the forges come from 
aggressive and amoral Reapers called Harvesters, who hunt down 
newborn wraiths for the express purposes of transforming them 
into material wealth one way or another. Slavery is a booming 
business in the Underworld, based not on color or creed, but on 
the simple proposition that the strong enslave the weak simply 
because they can. Wraiths unlucky enough to be caught by a 
Reaper of this sort are marched off to the Thrall markets or the 
soulforges, depending on where the best profit can be made.

It is a brutal, inhumane system, and yet it persists because 
no one chooses to do anything about it. There are a myriad of 
rationales: better those souls support the fight against Oblivion 

THE SMITHY

The art of soulforging was brought to Stygia 
by the great smith Nhudri, long ago. His appren-
tices in turn taught the art to others, eventually 
forming the Guild known as the Artificers. By 
and large, they have a monopoly on soulforging 
techniques, though here and there it’s possible to 
find someone who’s picked up the knack either 
through  illicit  instruction  or  other  means.  Of-
ficially, the Artificers, like all of the Guilds, are 
outlawed in Stygia, but the key role they play in 
the Stygian economy has granted them plenty of 
leeway for hiding in plain sight.

than eventually succumb to it, the practice is needed to defend 
against Oblivion’s ravages, soulforging literally crushes the Shadow 
out of a wraith — the list goes on. But regardless, the truth is 
that the system has been in place too long; too many wraiths are 
too heavily invested in it and there’s no easy substitute available. 
And so the forges will keep burning bright as they turn out the 
arms, armor, and other materiel Stygia needs to sustain itself.
Soulforging

The process by which material is soulforged is painfully 
simple. The Corpus of the subject is heated over soulfire crystals 
— crystal shards invested with Pathos by a master Usurer — until 
it softens and begins to melt, at which point the smith takes a 
hammer to it and begins to forge it into the desired shape. The 
process is repeated until the results are satisfactory to the forger. 
The end result is called soulsteel, and it is durable, tough, and 
holds an edge exceptionally well. 

Some smiths use only the hammer and tongs; others prefer 
to  cast  molten  plasm  into  molds.  But  regardless,  the  rule  of 
the Underworld is that a single soul can only be turned into a 
single item, except under certain extenuating circumstances. 
Artificers know the trick to pledging only a part of themselves 
to the forge; this is part of their initiation into the Guild, but 
the plasm they sacrifice can never grow back, and it is only the 
specialized knowledge of the Guild that allows them to do this at 
all. In the early days of Stygia, other wraiths were commanded 
to make the Tithe of the Dead, a sacrifice of part of their plasm 
to earn entry into the Underworld, but both this practice and 
the art by which these wraiths were only partially forged have 
both long since been lost. 

There remains a lively running debate about whether souls 
remain self-aware after they’ve been soulforged. It has been taken 
as an article of faith for centuries by the bulk of the Stygian 
population that they do not, and that the process eliminates 
any and all sentience. And yet, there are those who swear that 
this isn’t true. What is known is that soulforged items have an 
uncomfortable tendency to moan softly to themselves, often 
at the worst possible time.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

NHUDRI

Who or what Nhudri is remains a mystery, 
but modern Stygia would not exist without him. 
Every wraith in the Hierarchy knows the story 
of how Charon descended the Veinous Stair and 
brought forth Nhudri the Smith, who then taught 
the  secrets  of  soulforging  and  Stygian  steel  to 
his apprentices. However, beyond that the story 
gets fuzzy. While the official version has Charon 
releasing Nhudri from imprisonment, it’s never 
stated precisely who imprisoned him or how he 
got into the Labyrinth in the first place. Naturally, 
this led to an explosion of theorizing, conspiracy 
theories,  and  embellishments,  and  so-called 
“Nhudri ballads” (extended songs telling fanciful 
versions of the rescue) are popular pieces of any 
older Chanteur’s set 

Those who have met or served under Nhudri 
always describe him the same way: a huge, bald 
man with a shaggy beard and skin burned carbon 
black by soulfire. He wears simple garments and 
always carries with him his great hammer, which 
is so heavy that it requires multiple wraiths to 
lift it. Nhudri claims no nation as his own, and 
while  he  is  friendly  and  forthcoming  when  it 
comes to his work, he never discusses the time 
before  Charon  led  him  out  of  the  Labyrinth. 
Apprentices  know  better  than  to  ask,  or  they 
quickly become ex-apprentices. Nhudri himself 
remains  staunchly  apolitical,  and  he  has  not 
ventured  outside  his  forge  since  Charon’s  fall. 
He continues to take apprentices, and the great 
forges continue to churn out the armor, weapons, 
and other items that hold Stygia together. Busi-
ness is transacted in chambers far from the forge 
itself by polite but unsmiling apprentices, many of 
them unapologetically members of the Artificers 
Guild. Those who attempt to gain deeper access 
to the forges, perhaps in search of Nhudri himself, 
are caught and removed from the premises with 
vigor. Those who make it all the way in become 
new apprentices. 

What the forges produce is an endless variety of hard goods 
(softer items, like cushions, tend to be either relics or wraiths 
shapeshifted into item form through use of the Arcanos Moli-
ate). Swords, shields, girders, oboli, objets d’art, and more all 
come from the forges, as do the bones of many of the empire’s 
massive building projects. There’s not a strict one-to-one cor-
relation between the size of the Corpus forged and the size of 
the end product; the Law of Conservation of Mass holds no

sway in the Underworld. So a hulking plasmic could go into 
the forges and emerge as a delicately crafted ring, while a single 
Drone could be hammered into a massive girder. The limit in 
many cases is merely the smith’s imagination.

Relics and Artifacts

The  two  main  classes  of  items  in  the  Underworld  are 
relics and Artifacts. Relics come from the Skinlands. They’re 
the  ghosts  of  things  that  have  been  destroyed  or  have  been 
abandoned  or  rotted  away,  and  they  materialize  throughout 
the Shadowlands at the moment of their final destruction in 
the lands of the living. But mere destruction isn’t enough; they 
also need to have been invested with emotional significance — 
positive or negative — by someone. It’s that emotional fuel that 
provides the kick that turns a broken toy into an intact relic. 
This produces some odd disparities in the Underworld — there 
may be a billion broken cheap ballpoint pens in the world, but 
it’s the fancy models that were given as birthday presents and 
anniversary gifts that tend to pop up as relics. 

Artifacts are things created in the Underworld. They can 
include relics — indeed, many are based on them — but their 
function is a product of the afterlife. Anything that comes out 
of the forges is considered an Artifact, for example, as is a relic 
that’s been adapted to Underworld functional specs. The ghost 
of a pistol that only fired relic bullets would be considered itself 
a relic. That same pistol, retrofitted to fire infinite rounds while 
fueled by soulfire crystals, would be considered an Artifact.

Unless reinvested with emotional energy, relics eventually 
crumble  and  fade.  Sometimes  it’s  a  question  of  years,  some-
times of centuries, but they’re simply not made to last in the 
Underworld. Artifacts, on the other hand, tend to endure the 
ages exceptionally well, and thus are generally more desirable.

What Wraiths Want

What wraiths actually buy and sell is very different from 
what the living purchase. Wraiths don’t need food, their need for 
clothing is limited, and the real estate market among the dead 
is a very different thing once you no longer need bathrooms or 

RELIC HUNTING

Hunting relics is a common occupation in 
the Shadowlands. Wraiths stake out Skinlands 
locations that tend to produce frequent bounties 
— dangerous curves, incinerators and the like — 
in order to pounce on freshly translated relics. 
The strongest and most experienced relic hunters, 
often working in teams, tend to lay claim to the 
best  spots,  while  younger  and  less  experienced 
wraiths find themselves picking over less likely 
neighborhoods in the Necropolis — or outside 
its walls — in hopes of a lucky find.

kitchens. That being said, there are still items that wraiths want 
and will pay for. Instead of necessities, wraiths seek things that 
will either help preserve their existences or engage them as the 
long years roll past. Works of art and working firearms are both 
desirable to wraiths in a way that so much else can no longer be.
The most common exchanges among wraiths are swaps of 
service. They may seek one-time deals, measured in terms of 
the task that they want done or the length of time they want 
spent on a task — a bit of Moliation, some special Castigation 
attention in the wake of an unexpected upwelling of Spectres, 
or a suite of happy dreams. Or they may want an ongoing ar-
rangement — a year of Lifeweb help for servants or bodyguards 
at risk of losing fragile Fetters, a campaign of Pandemonium or 
Outrage-fueled attacks on enemies in the Skinlands. They all 
share the same general structure.

Beyond that, there are plenty of items that wraiths seek to 
possess. Relics and Artifacts are always sought after, sometimes 
for their usefulness and sometimes merely for aesthetic value or 
rarity. The cost of a functioning relic automobile, for example, 
is astronomical, while the relics of abandoned stuffed animals 
abound, making them as cheap as they are sought after. Weapons 
and armor are always useful, and those rare bits of high tech-
nology that make it through the Shroud are nearly priceless. 
Because of the haphazard nature of relic creation, the market 
value of items in Stygia can fluctuate wildly. What’s rarer than 
plasmics’ teeth one day can be part of a flood on the market the 
next if, say, a museum burns down. It’s all a matter of timing.
Oboli

Oboli are the only universally accepted coinage throughout 
Stygia. Different Necropoli may take different relic legal tender, 
and the trade in the ghosts of ancient currencies is ongoing, but 
for the day-to-day business of Stygia, oboli are preferred. The 
coins  themselves  are  heavy  for  their  size.  One  side  bears  the 
great seal of Stygia, the other an image of Charon’s Deathmask. 
Beyond that, they often bear the mark of the Necropolis and the 
forge where they were made, and in some cases the particular 
signature of the smith who forged them. They, more than other 
soulforged items, have a tendency to emit unnerving moans, and 
more than one wraith has sworn they felt the contents of their 
purse or moneybag move of their own accord. 

To possess an obolus is to make a statement. The fact that 
a wraith is able to devote a soul’s worth of material to coinage, 
rather than something more materially useful, says a great deal 
about that wraith’s wealth and power.

Unlike other soulforged items, it is possible to cut an obolus 
into fragments and pay for an item in that way. Interestingly 
enough, if left alone fragments of an obolus will inevitably flow 
together to create a new, complete coin. With Stygian prices 
as low as 1/32nd of an obolus, and some oboli having been in 
circulation for untold centuries, it’s impossible to guess how 
many souls have blended into new combinations over the years. 
And no one seems eager to find out.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

It is possible to reforge an obolus, whole or in pieces, into 
something  else,  but  it’s  inefficient.  Most  Artificers  will  lose 
at  least  half  the  soul  mass  to  sublimation  straight  into  the 
surrounding dark ether, and even experts will lose at least a 
quarter.  Given  the  choice,  any  Artificer  would  rather  make 
something else.

Not all wraiths wish to handle oboli, and the desire to avoid 
depending on the soulforges for anything that isn’t truly neces-
sary is common enough that few would-be buyers or sellers make 
a fuss about it. Forcing an unwilling trading partner to accept 
oboli is a naked exercise of power, with all the advantages and 
complications that gratuitous bullying generally brings.
Barter

With  oboli,  there  is  cash  available  to  Stygian  wraiths, 
but not much of it, compared to how many wraiths there are. 
So they have to make do as many living people do, with a 
system of credits and accounts that looks like barter but isn’t. 
Buyers and sellers keep track of what sellers would pay in oboli 
if they had them, and buyers know what many kinds of goods 
and services would be worth in oboli if they had them. Rel-
ics with frequently desired emotional resonances cost more 
than  ones  without.  Skilled  labor  —  whether  it’s  based  on 
knowledge brought from the Skinlands or on the use of handy 
Arcanoi — is worth more than the mere ability to move a 
load around. Wherever wraiths gather, some know what goods 
and services have cost in the past, there and elsewhere. They 
share information with each other to shape expectations of 
what prices should be now.

Wraiths who regularly engage in trade of any kind keep 
their ledgers in written form if they’re lucky enough to have ac-
cess to relic paper and pen, or with a wide variety of mnemonic 
devices if not. Some even arrange with skilled Masquers to turn 
some of their own Corpus into a variety of recording devices, 
their markers and debits on display for all to see. 

In practice, therefore, everything that might be for sale 
has a price, even if that price will seldom, if ever, be paid in 
hard currency.
The Art of the Deal

One of the basic rules for safe commerce in the Underworld 
is “have a witness.” In the words of another old saying among 
wraiths, “every deal between two is between four.” If two wraiths 
strike a bargain, their Shadows are both watching as well. Fur-
ther, one of the participants might actually be Shadow-ridden 
at the moment the deal is struck. Wraiths who can do so like to 
seek out a witness, either one with some means of recording key 
information or trained in the arts of accurate recall practiced 
in writing-poor societies. The witness is vulnerable to the same 
troubles other wraiths are, but it’s unlikely for three unrelated 
wraiths to hit them all at once.

Making a deal in private is, for most wraiths, an exercise 
in power. One of the participants is telling the other, “I’m in 
charge here, and you acknowledge that you are submitting to 
my terms. You don’t get the relief of any outsider interfering.” 
Where one wraith does have that power over another and wants 
to exercise it, buying and selling can happen anywhere at all. 
When neither participant can or wants to be so obviously 
the other’s boss, they make their deal someplace trustworthy 
witnesses gather. Many Necropoli have a city hall or some 
equivalent  building,  and  most  have  some  kind  of  officially 
recognized  marketplace  or  agora  where  wraiths  can  gather 
outdoors. Would-be witnesses come there, demonstrate their 
skills, and hope for the fees and prestige that come from ply-
ing their trade.
Stygian Steel

There’s one additional kind of durable material available to 
wraiths, valuable both when worked into goods and in its raw 
form. Stygian steel is an amalgam of exotic ingredients, very 
strong but very difficult to work with. It requires plasm harvested 
from dense clouds in the Tempest, where the gale winds render 
some plasm into a peculiar translucent gel, and rainbow-veined 
ore mined from the walls of the Veinous Stair or the Labyrinth’s 
endless tunnels. The metal that emerges when these elements 
are combined just right is a flat gunmetal gray when looked at 
directly, but shines with a silver light when seen at the edges 
of one’s field of view.

Stygian steel is both more ductile and more malleable than 
soulsteel. Once forged, it’s also easier to repair — the metal itself 
seems to sense efforts at restoring its shape and integrity and 
to cooperate with them. All of this makes it highly desirable 
for anything intended to last, from armor to weapons to the 
massive gates of the proudest Necropoli.

Since  they  last  indefinitely,  Stygian  steel  goods  keep 
circulating  through  Stygian  society.  A  wraith  who’s  made 
an unexpected windfall of tradable assets might get herself a 
particularly durable weapon or shield. A wraith with a special 
aptitude for rare Arcanos arts might cut a deal trading ongoing 
access to his specialty for an especially secure lockbox. It won’t 
happen in the normal course of events, but just as people in the 
Skinlands win lotteries and otherwise stumble into temporary 
(or even lasting) wealth, so it is in the Underworld.

Their  gains  may  be  at  risk  depending  on  the  attitude  of 
powerful wraiths in their vicinity. Some Anacreons think it’s 
just wrong for anyone but designated officials of the Hierarchy 
to hold anything so valuable. Independent, powerful wraiths may 
feel that commoners just don’t deserve such things, and that only 
the rich can properly appreciate or use them. A lucky, otherwise-
average wraith might well find himself enmeshed in conspiracies, 
chases, and unsolicited high adventure to keep possession of the 
valuable thing he thought he bought fair and square.

Metaphysics

f everyone died at peace with themselves 
and the world, feeling they’d done a good 
enough job wrapping up their life’s business, 
there’d be no wraiths. Wraiths exist because 
many of us die without that sort of resolution. 
They are, after all, the Restless Dead. And 
because they have that sort of unfinished 
business, they’re able to endure, granting themselves the haunted 
existence of a ghost beyond the Shroud. Relatively few mortals 
become wraiths. It is the rare soul that combines the drive and 
the rationale for resurrecting herself in this way. But while the 
numbers may not be great, they are steady, and the Underworld 
teems with the newly Restless. And properly fueled by Passions 
and anchored by Fetters, a wraith can seemingly endure eternally.
The Caul

A newly fledged wraith begins her existence in the Un-
derworld wrapped in an ectoplasmic sheath known as a Caul. 
Within the Caul, everything’s fuzzy, perception is limited, and 
movement is restricted. Wracked by the overwhelming emo-
tions of her new Passions, tormented by the voice of her nascent 
Shadow, and tugged on by both her Fetters and the fearsome 
gravity of Oblivion, she is experiencing the best and the worst 
of wraithly existence simultaneously as her soul is reshaped into 
one of the Restless Dead. 
The Corpus

A wraith’s body in the Underworld is called the Corpus. 
Rather than having complex biological systems, it’s made of 
a material called plasm that is, by and large, the raw stuff of 
the  afterlife.  In  the  right  hands  (such  as  those  belonging  to 
Masquers), plasm is endlessly mutable, allowing wraiths to be 
reshaped,  armored,  or  otherwise  remade.  Without  a  wraith’s 
guiding intelligence to hold it together, a Corpus can dissolve 
into a gooey puddle of clear, glistening plasm — or be soulforged 
into something more permanent and terrible. Wounded wraiths 
“bleed”  plasm,  but  the  Corpus  is  astonishingly  resilient  and 

THE BEGINNING
All  wraiths’  Cauls  appear  in  the  Shadow-
lands, the part of the Underworld closest to the 
lands of the living. Unless driven by extenuating 
circumstances — a Harrowing, the intervention 
of a Ferryman or Deathlord, setting foot on the 
Midnight Express — an Enfant is bound to the 
Shadowlands for a number of days equal to the 
rating of their strongest Fetter. The more potent 
the attachment, the longer it takes the wraith to 
be able to explore the deeper Underworld.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

heals easily from most wounds. And as an added bonus, when 
a wraith’s Corpus is destroyed, there’s still a chance of escape 
and return through the process of Harrowings.

The  original  appearance  a  wraith  presents  in  the  Un-
derworld is dependent largely on his deeply held conception 
of himself. As a result, most wraiths emerge from their Cauls 
looking  like  younger,  idealized  versions  of  themselves,  or  as 
more energetic versions of themselves as they died. This is not 
to say that every wraith comes out of the Caul looking like a 
champion bodybuilder, but rather that the wraith’s perception 
of himself, abetted and hindered by the Shadow, determines 
(within the rough boundaries of basic human anatomy) how the 
wraith appears to the rest of the Restless. What matters most 
is how the wraith feels they should appear — not a conscious 
choice, but a true one.
Reaping

The good news for the new wraith is that older wraiths want 
to help them, for certain values of “help.” The arrival of a new 
wraith leaves traces that careful observers can spot several dif-
ferent ways, including various Arcanoi. Wraiths already brought 
into the fold call the hunt for new wraiths Reaping, and there’s 
a healthy trade in bringing new souls into the Shadowlands. 
Reapers find a wraith still in her Caul and cut it apart, letting 
her emerge into the full reality of the Shadowlands. Once freed, 
she can sense, think, and feel fully, though it often takes some 
time to get over her disorientation.

The bad news is that many Reapers see the new arrivals 
as resources. Some of them only want Thralls, laborers bound 
as slaves or prisoners. Others want new souls as raw material 
for the soulforges. An Enfant who falls into the hands of one 
of these Reapers is in trouble from the get go, and unless she 
escapes, she may find her time in the Shadowlands to be nasty, 
brutish and short.

Other wraiths get more mentoring from their Reapers, and 
the Legions of the dead are constantly sending out parties of 
Reapers in hopes of bringing in fresh recruits. These new wraiths 
are treated relatively well — as long as they behave themselves.
Thralls

The official Stygian line is that Thralls are souls who are 
too weak to resist Oblivion on their own and thus they were 
pressed into service at Charon’s behest. Even this feeble ratio-
nalization has long since been abandoned. The trade in souls 
is too lucrative, and the need for raw materials is too great. 
Now, gangs of Reapers roam the Shadowlands, looking for new 
wraiths they can immediately clap into irons and then sell as 
Thralls.  More  enterprising  Reapers  will  ambush  travelers  or 
raid Renegade encampments in order to keep their coffles full 
and their pockets fuller. 

Anyone can be made into a Thrall. The Reapers do not 
discriminate by gender, race, age, Guild, Legion or anything 
else — it’s merely a question of opportunity and bad luck. Once 
the coffle is full, it’s off to the markets and the forges. “Lucky” 

REAPER’S CHAINS 
The obvious escape from Thralldom would 
seem to be to dive into a Harrowing, but even 
this route is denied them. One of Nhudri’s most 
ingenious — and diabolical — inventions, the 
Reaper’s Chains bind a wraith to the here and 
now so that they cannot use their Arcanoi and 
they cannot force themselves into a Harrowing. 
Any wraith attempting such a thing will wind up 
weakened,  battered,  and  weary,  but  still  firmly 
in  the  grip  of  their  chains.  Originally  created 
to hold only the most dangerous enemies of the 
empire,  the  chains  were  long  since  repurposed 
and the secret of their manufacture was spread 
far and wide.

Thralls are picked for hard labor, while others are earmarked 
for transmutation into soulsteel. 

Most Thralls are worked until they’re worn down. Unable to 
tend Passions and Fetters, they are ground down to near Drones, 
at which point they’re fed to the forges. This in turn generates 
a need for new Thralls, and the cycle continues.

There have been periodic movements to ban Thralldom 
in  Stygia.  Thus  far,  they  have  always  failed.  The  practice  is 
too profitable, and too many powerful wraiths benefit from it.
In a few instances, coffles of Thralls have worked together 
to strike down those who’d chained them, and escape. There 
are also gangs of Renegades who have no love for the chattel 
slavery Thralldom represents, and who strike at Reapers to free 
their cargos whenever they can.
Masks

Not every Hierarchy wraith wears a mask, but every wraith 
who wants to be someone within the Hierarchy does. Masks are 
many things to the Restless Dead: symbols of office, expressions 
of self, and in some cases, items of power. Charon’s mask was 
not merely ceremonial, nor are the Deathlords’ masks merely 
tokens of office. 

The richest and most powerful among the dead have masks 
made from Stygian steel, often inset with soulfire gems or tiny, 
precious Relics. Poorer or less powerful wraiths must settle for 
soulsteel, or even Relics. 

Initially, wraiths adopted masks with Charon’s encourage-
ment. He felt that the anonymity of masks would allow wraiths 
to speak freely in council, without fear of reprisal. Needless to 
say, this did not work out as planned.

Every Necropolis has a maskmaker in residence, either a 
Masquer, an Artificer, or a particularly clever craftsman. There 
are also bands of traveling maskmakers who move from Necropo-
lis to Necropolis, hawking their wares and taking commissions. 

SETTING

47

DRONES

Some  wraiths  never  make  it  out  of  their 
Cauls. They linger on, losing mental clarity and 
emotional intensity. If they aren’t devoured by 
passing  Spectres  or  creatures  who  hunt  in  the 
Shadowlands,  they  become  the  mindless  enti-
ties wraiths call Drones. These are the obsessed 
haunting figures of so many ghost stories, whose 
last shreds of willpower all focus on some single 
person, place, or thing that was important to them. 
They no longer remember why they’re drawn to 
it, only that they want it for themselves. If it’s 
destroyed, the Drone makes the long drop into 
Oblivion, never to return.

When ordering a mask, a wraith must be cautious. Commis-
sion a design too close to that of one’s superiors, and be accused 
of toadying flattery; ask for one too original and attract suspi-
cion. In addition, many masks are attached to the offices they 
represent. Most Anacreons’ masks are handed down from one 
holder of the title to the next, symbolizing the continuity of the 
Hierarchy. Individual wraiths may fall, but the whole endures.
Renegades  and  Heretics  also  have  been  known  to  wear 
masks, though for different reasons. Ritual masks are common 
among Heretic cults, while Renegades take great care to hide 
their identities. Their masks tend to be plain and functional, 
as opposed to the ever-more-ornate models worn by those in 
service to the Isle. 
Deathmarks

Every  wraith’s  Corpus  is  marked  with  indicators  of  her 
death and life. These Deathmarks are present on all wraiths, 
though the vain and the subversive do their best to Moliate 
them away. Caused by trauma and the use of certain Arcanoi, 
Deathmarks offer a roadmap of a wraith’s death and afterlife to 
any who know how to read them. 

Deathmarks are also good indicators of what Legion and 
Guild a wraith might belong to, which is why many wraiths 
strive to keep theirs hidden. Sometimes, the afterlife is easier 
if your whole story isn’t literally written on your face.
Psyche and Shadow

To be a wraith is to be divided. This is nothing entirely new: 
Every living person sometimes feels torn between rival goals, 
or impulsively does something he wouldn’t have chosen after 
a moment’s thought. Will, desire, hope, fear and everything 
else that influences choices of action add up to a messy churn-
ing stew of the soul. It gets more complicated and dangerous 
across  the  Shroud,  because  Oblivion’s  all-consuming  power 
can — and does — echo inside each ghostly soul without liv-
ing flesh to temper it. 

As a result, each wraith comprises two parts: Psyche and 
Shadow. Psychic siblings locked in eternal conflict within the 
same shell, one struggles to endure while the other seeks the 
path down to the Void.

The Psyche is the essence of a wraith: his memory, personal-
ity, and the drives that keep him connected to the Skinlands. 
It’s the Psyche who feels the Passions that keep him active and 
who’s drawn to the Fetters that sustain him when he’s in need. 
(See below for more about both of these.)

The  Shadow  is  also  the  essence  of  a  wraith:  his  self-
condemnation, and everything in him that yearns to destroy 
his own accomplishments and lash out at the world. It would 
be  very  convenient,  morally,  if  this  were  all  forced  on  the 
wraith by Oblivion and had nothing to do with who he is, but 
it doesn’t work that way. 

Oblivion calls to the urge toward destruction in everyone 
and  everything,  on  both  sides  of  the  Shroud.  When  a  soul 
crosses the Shroud and hears that call so much more strongly, 
it’s Oblivion that empowers part of the wraith, giving it the 
strength to develop an identity of its own. But Oblivion invents 
nothing. It gives power to what’s already there. Every person has 
some baser impulses, some drives anchored in fear, envy, and 
the like rather than in nobler feelings like hope and joy. The 
wraith was no sinless angel in life, and his whole self crosses 
into the afterlife, for good or for ill.

The Shadow is as self-aware as the Psyche, and it has its 
own reserve of spiritual power, called Angst. It can sense what 
the Psyche senses. It can talk directly to the Psyche, and make 
bargains with the Psyche, offering some of its power when the 
Psyche needs help. It can even attack the Psyche with its own 
powers, called Thorns, and use them to thwart and sabotage 
the Psyche’s plans.

Throughout  a  wraith’s  time  in  the  Underworld,  these 
two halves of their legacy and self compete for control. What 
distinguishes wraiths from Spectres is which half is winning 
overall. Wraiths experience moments where the Shadow takes 
control, but these stand out as not being the norm; most of the 
time, the Psyche is making the decisions. Spectres have lost the 
battle — sometimes in the very moment they cross the Shroud, 
sometimes later — and the Shadow is permanently in charge. 
They’re now part of Oblivion’s story, not their own.
Passions and Fetters

Together, Passions and Fetters sum up a wraith’s unfinished 
business with life, the things that allowed her soul to stick around 
postmortem. Emotions and attachments strong enough to defy 
death, more than anything else, are what matters in a wraith’s 
existence.  In  a  real  sense  they  help  define  her,  and  lay  the 
groundwork for much of what she may do as one of the Restless.
Passions are as they are named, the potent emotions and 
purposes that a wraith feels most strongly and that power her 
Restless existence. Acting in accordance with a wraith’s Pas-
sions generates the energy called Pathos that she calls upon to 

48

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

use many of her wraithly abilities. They are her, the reasons 
she  feels  compelled  to  continue  to  defy  death.  And  while  a 
Passion  may  be  focused  on  an  action  —  protecting  a  loved 
one or a beloved neighborhood, finding a killer, or seeing a 
long-standing injustice corrected — at the heart of each one is 
a singular emotion. The more the wraith acts on that emotion, 
the more Pathos she generates, granting her greater capability 
and flexibility of action.

Wraiths  thrive  on  intense  feelings,  and  not  necessarily 
just nice ones. If felt strongly enough, grief and rage play their 
part in keeping Oblivion at bay as much as love and joy do. A 
wraith who fails to express her Passions does so at their own 
risk, leaving her vulnerable to Oblivion and at risk of having 
those Passions atrophy into nothingness.

Fetters,  on  the  other  hand,  are  the  people,  places,  and 
things in the living world that a wraith remains attached to, 
the  anchors  that  hold  her  steady  against  Oblivion’s  endless 
pull. Where her Passions are the things she feels most strongly, 
her Fetters are the things she feels most strongly about. They 
may be things she loved in life: living relatives and loved ones, 
places where treasured events happened, or the tools she used 
in satisfying work. They may be hated reminders of old losses 
and failures that sustain her anger: the rival who took her place 
with a loved one who didn’t return her love, a monument to 
an enemy, the prison cell where she suffered. Some Fetters are 
big, obvious things in the living world, like human beings and 
cities. Others are small, like a beloved pen or piece of jewelry. 
The soul doesn’t care about physical scale, only about personal 
importance.

A wraith who’s been badly damaged returns to one of her 
Fetters for healing sleep. Being close to it renews her Corpus. 
Sensitive mortals may feel her presence; it’s the source of many 
experiences of being haunted without the fear ghosts usually 
bring. 

People change over time, and the Restless Dead are no 
exception. The intensity of their Passions and the degree of 
their commitment to their Fetters rise and fall in response to 
the events of their afterlives, because nothing is static in the 
Underworld. 

Wraiths’ Passions and Fetters can change in two basic ways:
• Resolution: The wraith reaches a point where she can 
let go peacefully of one of her old attachments, and does. This 
is risky, but she can succeed despite the hardships, and then 
is no longer defined in part by that feeling or thing. In game 
terms, she simply no longer has that Fetter. She is that much 
closer to Transcendence, if she wishes to pursue it.

• Destruction: Outside forces can attack a wraith’s Pas-
sions and Fetters, too. In times of severe overall injury or tar-
geted attack by Spectres, she may be pulled into a Harrowing 
specifically intended to grind down a feeling. Her Fetters can 
be attacked deliberately by knowing forces reaching up from 
the Underworld, and also by all the happenstance of existing 
in the Skinlands. A skyscraper may seem like an indestructible 

Fetter, but if an earthquake sends it tumbling down, it’s gone 
and the wraith feels the effects. A wraith pulled involuntarily 
away from a Passion or Fetter is left diminished and hurting, and 
vulnerable thereafter for lack of one of her  crucial resources.  
Occasionally, a wraith forms a brand-new Passion based on her 
experiences in the Underworld. Love for other wraiths, the de-
sire to fix an injustice in wraithly society, hatred for Oblivion’s 
minions — strongly felt emotions of all sorts can become part 
of a wraith’s very reason for continued existence. See p. 305 
for information on developing new Passions.
Catharsis and Harrowings

Inevitably, sometimes the Psyche weakens and the Shadow 
gains temporary control of the wraith’s Corpus. Wraiths call 
that time of domination by the Shadow “Catharsis.” It may last 
for just a few seconds, and seldom lasts more than a few hours, 
but there’s plenty of potential for mischief in even the briefest 
of takeovers. While it’s in charge, the Shadow is free to pursue 
its own driving Passions, and can use the Psyche’s powers along 
with its own. The wraith’s Corpus looks the same as always to 
other  wraiths  (though  some  Arcanoi  can  reveal  the  truth), 
making  it  hard  to  detect  that  somebody  new  is  temporarily 
in charge. Of course, when a wraith comes out of Catharsis, 
he has to deal with whatever deeds his Shadow committed in 
the interim. Sometimes the damage is apparent immediately; 
sometimes it takes days or even years for a Shadow scheme to 
pay off in disaster.

Far worse than a bout of Catharsis is a Harrowing. When a 
wraith suffers grievous damage to her Corpus, loses a Fetter or 
Passion, or runs out of Willpower, then she is instantly pulled 
down through a Nihil to the very depths of the Labyrinth. There, 
she’s confronted with a nightmare psychodrama concocted by 
her Shadow in conjunction with troupes of Spectres. Drawing 
on the wraith’s hidden fears and insecurities, the Harrowing 
presents her with a seemingly inescapable scenario. If, by dint 
of  intelligence,  persistence  and  determination,  she  unravels 
the puzzle of the Harrowing, she’s released back to the higher 
Underworld  little  the  worse  for  wear.  If  she  doesn’t,  then  a 
terrible price must be paid. And, in a few rare instances called 
Destruction Harrowings, the price of failure is dissolution as 
the wraith falls into the mouth of the Void. 

Stygia

raiths  spend  a  lot  of  their  existence  in 
empty places. The world is big, and there 
just aren’t as many wraiths relative to living 
people. Every Necropolis has its busy spots 
and  around  them  whole  neighborhoods 
where a wraith may be all alone, with only 
glimpses  across  the  Shroud  and  her  own 
Shadow. The depths of the Underworld are much bigger than 
the world, and have even more empty spaces, and there are

COMMON, THAT IS, DISRESPECTFUL USAGE

Wraiths are no more likely than the living to 
spend all their time being solemn and pedantic. 
They have to fill their waking hours, and with 
many options available to the living taken away 
from them. Many of Stygia’s residents indulge in 
the age-old pastime of mocking the terminology 
and titles of authorities over them. To wraiths not 
very enthusiastic about defense, Stygia doesn’t 
resemble a sickle but a banana. Whatever insult-
ing labels occur to the members of a troupe for 
the oh-so-serious business of Stygia are likely to 
have occurred to the wraiths there as well, and to 
work their way into conversation outside official 
circumstances.

countless places where there may be lots of exotic creatures or 
Spectres but very few wraiths.
Then there’s Stygia.
Stygia is the city of wraiths, at least in the Dark Kingdom of 
Iron. Ancient beyond comprehension and constantly inhabited 
by millions upon millions of wraiths, it sprawls for miles across 
its original island, shallows of the Sunless Sea, and nearby is-
lands. It is simultaneously altogether unlike any living city and 
deeply familiar in its parts, since it includes the memories of 
famous buildings, monuments, roads, and features from across 
the western world.

It is the capital of Charon’s venerable empire and it is the 
place to see and be seen among the dead. It’s home to wraiths in 
a way no other place can ever be. Sooner or later, the ambitious, 
the powerful, and the lost all find their way here. 

Stygia  rests  on  and  around  the  Isle  of  Sorrows,  a  stable 
point within the Sea of Shadows. It’s at the mouth of the River 
of Death, which flows through much of the Dark Kingdom of 
Iron, and stands just a few miles from the top of the Veinous 
Stair, which runs all the way down into the Labyrinth.

These are not things that could all be true of any place 
in the Skinlands. Rivers don’t flow through seas, for instance, 
except  in  the  form  of  currents  in  special  conditions.  In  the 
Underworld,  geography  is  more  accommodating.  The  River 
of Death partly flows from island to island like a current in a 
physical ocean, but it also descends through rapids, falls, and 
twists through multiple dimensions. Likewise, the sea around 
the  Veinous  Stair  is  sometimes  like  water,  sometimes  like  a 
howling wind, and sometimes turbulent in complex ways all 
its own. The Underworld keeps reminding its inhabitants that 
it’s not like where they came from.

Approaching the City

Almost all modern wraiths approach Stygia either by rail 
or by river. It’s certainly possible to fly in when there’s no storm 
blowing, but not encouraged. The city’s defenders always worry 
about what might come in airborne, and space for landing strips 
is  in  short  supply.  For  decades,  there  was  a  regular  zeppelin 
service along the river, but a series of four-bell Maelstroms in 
the late 1970s took care of that.
By River

Tributaries of the River of Death flow through the Shad-
owlands in whatever direction they need to, and not always 
consistently at that — river sections that reverse their flow are 
commonplace. They take on more consistent directions as they 
converge. The main channel of the river traces a continental-
scale arc like the shape of a sickle head — much like that of 
Stygia itself — starting at a northwest point, curving east and 
south, and finally flowing west as it empties out into the sea.

For the last several hundred miles of its length, the river is 
always at least a mile wide, with countless islands large and small 
dotting the expanse. The river flows deep, too. It has shoals that 
may rest just a few feet below the surface, but the main channel 
is always hundreds of feet deep, often thousands, and in many 
places it is apparently bottomless. The largest relic vessels ever 
known can safely sail it, along with soulsteel constructs larger 
than anything the Skinlands could ever support. Famous relic 
ships work the channel regularly, along with strange agglomera-
tions of a half-dozen relic vessels bolted together in ungainly 
fashion. The rafts of the Ferrymen also patrol the river’s course, 
and even the largest vessels will turn aside at the sight of the 
hood and lantern. 

The river is also home to some of the only living things in 
the Underworld, using the term loosely. Stands of withered and 
gnarled trees line the riverbank in clumps here and there, their 
long branches drooping down to almost touch the water. This 
is the only vegetation the river possesses, and few wraiths are 
brave enough to take saw or axe to them. Doing so is said to be 
bad luck, and more importantly, will incur the Ferrymen’s wrath.
Also seen along the banks of the river and up into the great 
chasm that is Horse-Noose Canyon are the last few of the wild 
horses Charon tamed and gave to his Equitaes. Fierce and wild-
eyed, they run in herds of up to 20 at a time. Approaching them 
is foolish, as their hooves are as hard as Stygian steel and they 
don’t take kindly to strangers. On rare occasions they can be 
seen swimming from one side of the river to the other, daring 
whatever plasmic predators lurk in the deeps to try their luck. 
Few, if any, ever do.

Docks surround the Isle of Sorrows, and also many of the 
smaller islands it’s now connected with. The docks are busy, 
but travelers have long waits for customs and inspections only 
in rare moments of crisis.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

By Rail

The Midnight Express is the most famous railway in the 
Underworld,  but  not  the  only  one.  Many  groups  of  wraiths 
build and maintain rail lines for all sorts of reasons, from simple 
ambition to a desire to continue doing what one did in life. 
Some are small-gauge routes intended only to carry a few people 
at a time, others are more rugged tracks intended to carry the 
heaviest cargos that wraiths prefer not to send by other means. 
Most of the time, these lines and the trains on them have 
little to do with each other. There’s plenty of room and more, 
due to simple space-twisting tricks that let crossing routes never 
directly intersect. The one area they come together is in the 
last few miles outside Stygia. Tracks of all styles and gauges rise, 
fall, and bend as necessary to line up in parallel on trestles built 
from ancient ruins and storm debris. They skim across the sea, 
100 feet above sea level, to arrive at the largest depot in the 
Dark Kingdom of Iron. Built largely from long-replaced pieces 
of  Grand  Central,  Union  Station,  Gare  de  Lyon,  and  many 
more, it has an immense Victorian grandeur that both welcomes 
wraiths to the island and warns them that they should be on 
their best behavior. 

The Lay of the Land (and Sea)

The Isle of Sorrows is shaped like the head of a giant sickle 
half-sunken in the Sea. (In fact, the isle has much the same 
shape as the main channel of the River of Death. Debates about 
whether that’s fate, coincidence, or someone’s plan keep idle 
wraiths busy.) The tip of the sickle lies to the northwest, and 
the blade curves east, then south, with a fragment of handle 
running off to the southwest. It’s eight miles in a straight line 
from the tip to the handle, and 15 miles along the curve; the 
arc of the island is generally three to five miles wide.

The River of Death flows in from the east to meet the broad 
curve of the isle. The isle here rises gently from the waterfront 
up to the crest. The enclosed bay has much steeper slopes, with 
many outright cliffs and heavy switchbacking required for all 
the routes coming up from the bay’s interior. To the southwest, 
marshy lowlands and haphazard channels cut through the sea 
to the Emerald Keep a few miles away. The Emerald Keep is the 
official last bulwark before the Veinous Stair; beyond it flow 
the tainted waters that swirl around the Stair.

Nearly every inch of the isle is covered in some sort of 
construction,  driven  by  the  pressure  of  wraith  population. 
Storms still happen as they always did, and plasm continues to 
accumulate  in  little  valleys  and  depressions  before  tumbling 
down well-worn channels to the sea. But now almost all the 
channels are paved and monitored, and there are only walled 
groves for the few remaining trees. Erosion is a fact of the Un-
derworld just like in the Skinlands, and over the centuries it’s 
cut dangerous paths through older layers of construction. Newly 
arrived and newly built structures require ever more elaborate 
bridges, buttresses, and support columns, driven ever deeper 
down into the isle’s foundations. And so the city presents as a 

layer cake of architectural style, skyscrapers pressing down on 
Art Deco façades built on top of castles and chateaus, which 
in turn squat on Roman ruins and Athenian temples. Students 
of history will constantly find marvels here, that is, if they’re 
not run over by foot traffic while they gawk.

Tradition says the isle has seven hills, with seven of the 
eight Deathlords choosing to build their Citadels there. (The 
Lady of Fate chose to put hers on the Isle of Eurydice, 20 miles 
offshore, and has kept it there ever since.) This isn’t exactly 
wrong. The center ridge of the island does rise and fall, and 
there clearly are distinct hills. But in truth, there are at least 
nine of them, or there were before two of them were devoured 
by construction. Nonetheless, the popular lore is well fixed by 
now, so seven hills it is.
Major Features

These are landmarks that the wraiths of Stygia use to orient 
themselves. “Go here and make a left,” “It’s halfway up the hill 
on this side of there”…these are the heres and theres of Stygia.
The Onyx Tower is the oldest surviving structure on the 
isle.  Charon  built  a  lighthouse  when  he  made  the  isle  his 
home, on the very highest point of land at the very tip of the 
scythe’s curve. It grew and grew over the centuries, with many 
other wraiths’ labor adding to Charon’s own work. The Onyx 
Tower itself has remained locked since Charon closed it up on 
his way to fight Gorool, but the lighthouse it’s part of remains 
active, and the many supporting buildings around its base are 
as busy as ever.

It is the Onyx Tower that most wraiths think of when they 
think of Stygia, and that’s with good reason. Gleaming black 
and  silver,  it  towers  over  even  the  Deathlords’  Citadels.  Its 
beacon can be seen to the very edges of the Sea of Shadows, 
and it has withstood countless Maelstroms with nary a scratch. 
Legend has it that the base of the Tower was built upon the 
relic pieces of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, and that every so 
often its light somehow pierces the Shroud to be seen by lost 
mariners in the Skinlands.

The Road of Lords runs at or near the crest of the isle’s 
center ridge, from the Onyx Tower all the way to the causeway 
that leads to the Emerald Keep. In early days, this was a very 
sharply sloping path, but it’s been progressively leveled with 
the  help  of  tunnels  and  bridges.  In  addition,  because  of  its 
prominent exposure to the forces of Underworld weather, it’s 
almost entirely enclosed beneath cantilevered ceilings, with 
windows that can be shuttered tightly during the worst storms. 
The road has junctions with short roads to each of the Citadels 
and a few other prominent features.

For much of its length, the official Road of Lords is ac-
companied  by  less  official,  less  maintained  roads  that  make 
their way across the terrain as best they can. The armed troops 
of the Legions have priority access to the Road of Lords, and 
there are always travelers who’d prefer not to have to yield to 
the armies on the march. In some places, the less formal and 

SETTING

51

direct roads keep to older, rougher ways; in others, they tunnel 
under or even pass along the top of the official route.

The Citadels occupy the best high ground, each one sepa-
rated from the next by at least a mile. From north (closest to 
the Onyx Tower) to south (farthest away), they are: the Seat 
of Shadows, home of the Iron Legion; the Seat of Dust, home 
of the Skeletal Legion; the Seat of Burning Waters, home of 
the Grim Legion; the Seat of Succor, home of the Penitent 
Legion; the Seat of Silence, home of the Silent Legion; the 
Seat of Golden Tears, home of the Legion of Paupers; and the 
Seat of Thorns, home of the Emerald Legion.

The Road of Steel runs around the whole island, resting 
on a retaining wall that keeps it five feet above sea level. Boat 
landing strips, dry docks, drainage ditches, and the like pass 
through the wall, and the Road of Steel rises over them on short 
bridges. As the name suggests, it’s made of soulsteel, though of 
a unique, silver-white kind seen nowhere else. Popular legend 
has that it’s the leftovers from a truly massive secret project 
Nhudri undertook for Charon shortly after arriving on the isle.
The Road of Steel is the widest route on the island, wide 
enough for infantry regiments to march in standard formation 
and for whole buildings to travel on their special platforms when 
it’s time to relocate. Warehouses and maritime businesses fill 
its landward edge as it circles the western bay, while its eastern 
curve hosts residential mansions, more warehouses, museums, 
temples, and a bit of everything else. Over time, ancient wraiths 
say, everything in Stygia sinks down or rises up far enough to 
butt into the Road of Steel.

The Road of Souls cuts across the Isle of Sorrows in an 
east-west line, rising from the bay up through the deepest pass 
in the center ridge, meeting the Road of Lords at that road’s 
lowest point, and descending to the eastern shore. It’s almost 
as wide as the Road of Steel, and graded as gently as possible to 
let heavy, awkward, and slow traffic make the trip in something 
like safety. The Seat of Burning Waters overlooks the Road of 
Souls from the north, and the Seat of Silence from the south.
The Road of Souls has two tiers for its whole length. The 
lower level is reserved for pedestrian traffic and small vehicles 
like pedicabs. The massive main level is open to the skies, and 
has patrols enforcing minimum size and weight requirements 
so that lesser traffic doesn’t get in the way.

The Sea of Souls is the official name of the bay, though 
almost  all  Stygians  simply  call  it  “the  bay.”  It’s  filled  with  a 
kind of soulforged liquid as distinctive as the Road of Steel’s 
material. The bay’s liquid is more viscous than the water-like 
plasm beyond, and slightly denser. Ships that sail on it can’t 
move very rapidly, but the viscosity helps hold them upright 
and steady for unloading in all conditions and provides extra 
protection against capsizing during storms. The popular story 
says the bay is what remains of the first epic project undertaken 
by  Nhudri’s  first  apprentices,  and  has  something  to  do  with 
anchoring the whole island. Stygian naval vessels patrol the 
bay endlessly, keeping a watchful eye for Spectres and other 
monstrosities in the waters below. Notable among them is the 

Jameson, a refurbished WWI battleship whose booming guns, 
augmented by Nhudri himself, can be heard above even the 
loudest Maelstrom winds.

The Seawall is a 100-foot-tall wall of pure black soulsteel 
surrounding the isle, with just a handful of gateways to allow 
ships to pass. In some places it’s within 100 feet of the shore; in 
others it’s up to half a mile away. It’s one continuous construc-
tion — the gates don’t run all the way to the seafloor, so when 
they’re closed the whole wall presents a unified defense and 
can be acted upon by Arcanoi that deal with single, though 
large, objects.

The Iron Hills is a cluster of eight islands not far beyond 
the  Seawall,  off  the  eastern  and  northern  shores  of  the  Isle 
of Sorrows. They used to be given over to luxury estates and 
preserves, but thanks to constant population pressure, Charon 
chose to incorporate them into Stygia proper early in the 20th 
century.  Networks  of  bridges  and  causeways  now  tie  them 
together with Stygia, though they’re still on their own when 
the Seawall closes.
The Ever-Drowning City

Stygian architecture extends far out to sea and far below 
surface level. The original Isle of Sorrows is now almost com-
pletely buried under the weight of many layers of construction. 
The Relic buildings that make up most of the city don’t actually 
fade out of existence, but they do weaken. They may crumble, 

AN ISLE OF LEGACIES

Nearly  every  building  on  Stygia  is  a  relic 
or Artifact. When Charon founded Stygia and 
wraiths first gathered there in large numbers, the 
ghosts of famous landmarks would drift through 
the Underworld by themselves as if drawn mag-
netically. As the population grew, and the Hier-
archy developed with it, deliberate city planning 
followed. The Deathlords and other prominent 
officials make their interest in this building or that 
known, and their underlings engage in whatever 
diplomacy it takes to make that happen.

For  Storytellers  and  players  alike,  this  is  a 
chance to customize the setting for your chronicle. 
If you have favorite old architecture that’s been 
lost to the living world, it can have a place in 
Stygia. Storytellers, when your players ask about 
this landmark or that, say “yes” and decide where 
it is rather than saying “no” unless you have some 
particularly good reason. Stygia is a city where 
the  continued  memorial  interest  of  the  living 
matters intensely, and if your players are showing 
interest, then it’s a safe bet that living people in 
the World of Darkness would be, too.

54

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

and they’re prone to subsiding. There’s a constant flow of new 
construction and new relic delivery because there must be — 
not  every  landmark  can  remain  useful  or  even  safe  century 
after century. Damaged old buildings slide or get pushed across 
the Road of Steel to sink down into the bay or sea, with new 
work  taking  their  place.  When  Maelstroms  blow,  landslides 
and earthquakes can knock buildings and even whole districts 
down, leaving more empty scars to fill with new arrivals once 
things settle down again.

In addition to the shed remains of the city’s older buildings, 
the surrounding seafloor is covered by buildings and miscel-
laneous debris that never quite made it to Stygia. There are 
buildings that tore apart while being transported and couldn’t 
be reassembled, which were then dumped into the sea. There 
are remains, sometimes very large ones, washed down the length 
of the River of Death until they bump into the shallows around 
Stygia. There are also ruins, which seem to push up from below 
without anyone in Stygia being responsible. Some of these can’t 
be identified, while others can and prove to have arrived from 
all over the Dark Kingdom of Iron’s wildest corners. 

The Districts

Much of Stygia is policed and managed by one of the Le-
gions, usually whichever has the closest Citadel. This doesn’t 
mean that the inhabitants all share a deathmark. There are 
too many wraiths on Stygia with too many concerns to make 
sorting like that viable. Wraiths go to whichever distract they 
can find work, entertainment, and a congenial place to slumber. 
Close to a Citadel, three-quarters or more of the wraiths passing 
by are likely to belong to that Legion. Downhill, around the 
shores, in the crowded valleys along the way, half or fewer of 
the wraiths in sight share their overseers’ deathmark.

Each  district  has  its  own  civil  patrol,  whose  officers  func-
tion as police, customs officers, and whatever responsibility the 
Deathlord in charge chooses to assign them. Depending on the 
Deathlord, anywhere from one to three quarters of the patrolling 
officers belong to the same Legion as the Deathlord, with the others 
recruited from the ranks of all the wraiths who prefer to dwell in 
the district. Patrollers provide most of their own equipment, with 
the exception of insignia. These insignia combine Legion symbols 
with a stylized rendering of the district’s map silhouette or some 
favorite landmark. The self-arming practice changes in times of 
Maelstrom  and  other  general  crises,  when  all  the  Deathlords, 
no matter what their other concerns, make sure their forces are 
properly armed and armored.
Lower Bay

The commercial heart of Stygia, Lower Bay runs the entire 
north-south length of the bay. It’s entirely given over to business. 
Some wraiths may make havens for themselves, but they do so 
secretly; as far as the police patrols are concerned, everybody 
goes somewhere else to slumber.

Lower Bay is evenly divided between relics from harbors 
throughout the Dark Kingdom of Iron and original construction 

out of local materials. The piers and warehouses here reach back 
to ancient Crete, and include some destroyed as recently as World 
War II. The soulforged buildings tend to look very much alike, 
and very little like the relics, since many of the harbormasters 
over the centuries have favored uniform construction as part of 
uniform policy about taxation and administration. The actual 
diversity of Lower Bay reflects the ongoing struggle for decision-
making authority among the current harbormaster, the Legions’ 
representatives in the district, and other prominent wraiths.
Upper Bay

Upper Bay also runs the entire length of the bay, starting where 
the slopes become too steep for most warehouses and heading up to 
the heights around the Road of Lords where there’s level enough 
ground to support more buildings. Most of this is sheer cliff face 
and slopes far too rugged to be worth anyone’s while to build on, 
but no place in Stygia can go altogether empty.

There  are  extensive  caves  at  half  a  dozen  points,  and 
smaller ones at many more. The largest of all is the Hermit-
age,  supervised  jointly  by  the  Penitent  and  Silent  Legions 
for those who wish to retreat from Underworld society safely. 
Expert Pardoners patrol the caves for signs of Shadow trouble 
and have the right to intervene when they deem it necessary, 
while otherwise leaving the hermits alone. 

Upper Bay is home to one of the largest relic wrecks in 
Stygia. Half a mile of Roman buildings destroyed in the fire 
during Nero’s reign used to rest on the west side of the Road 
of Lords. When the First Great Maelstrom broke, the entire 
stretch of hilltop came loose and toppled over. It skidded to a 
stop halfway down and has stayed there ever since, tilted 70 
degrees from horizontal. Fallen Rome, as it’s known, is a favor-
ite gathering place for wraiths with a talent for Argos, and for 
non-Argos-using climbers and daredevils. 

Also  found  here  is  a  massive  statue  known  as  Dominus 
Ex Anima. No one can recall who made it or when it first ap-
peared; as far as anyone can remember, it’s always been there. 
The  Dominus,  as  impertinent  wraiths  call  it,  is  made  from 
relic marble and bronze, clabbered together to make a massive 
figure who appears to be watching out over the bay itself. Some 
say the figure is Charon; others claim it is a prophecy of the 
one who will someday succeed Charon. In any case, even the 
cheekiest of wraiths show the sculpture a great deal of respect, 
as standing in the presence of its power and majesty can be a 
sobering experience. 
Riverside

Unlike most of the districts, Riverside isn’t a single con-
tinuous area. It’s the name given to all the parts of the western 
shore where Legion claims and interests don’t run all the way to 
the waterline. Some of these are small, rocky outcroppings that 
have been exploited since whatever tremor pushed them up, 
and most encompass just a few blocks of neglected, crumbling 
relics. Most of Riverside comprises places for wraiths to go when 

SETTING

55

they lack connections and haven’t had the personal luck or suc-
cess to buy their way into any of the available social networks.
The biggest exception to that generalization is the Library, 
just north of the east end of the Road of Souls. This area became 
neutral ground not because nobody wanted it, but because every-
body did, and the struggle for control was doing significant damage 
to the thing everyone was fighting for. At the heart of the Library 
is the Library of Alexandria, now buried deep beneath the Road 
of Steel by later arrivals. Today, the Library includes legacies as 
small as single-room libraries from Pompeii and as large as the 
great library of Constantinople. The Library extends almost half 
a mile inland, many stories underground, and includes piers far 
out into the sea and two spires just over half a mile tall, com-
bining relics, solidified dreams taken from modernist architects, 
and  more  of  Nhudri’s  unique  handiwork.  Cadres  of  librarians 
work the stacks, as they have steadily for centuries, inducting 
newcomers into their ways and protecting the valuable contents 
of the shelves and vaults. Every lost and loved book comes to 
the Library eventually, and espionage is constant as Deathlords, 
thieves, and even agents of rival kingdoms of the dead seek to 
“liberate” particularly valuable items for their own uses.

Also found in Riverside is the Fountain of Caroline, a prime 
spot for wraiths with grievances, manifestos, or prophecies to 
stand up and share their thoughts with Stygia. What might be 
considered treasonous talk elsewhere in the city is tolerated at 
Caroline’s by long tradition. And so ranters, poets, prophets, 

and revolutionaries all get their say so long as they stand at the 
foot of the fountain.
Onyx Point

This, as the few residents seldom tire of saying, is where it 
all began. This is where Charon built his first permanent shel-
ter, and where he set up his lighthouse. When Charon was in 
residence, this was one of the busiest places in Stygia, the Road 
of Lords carrying a constant traffic of officials, petitioners, and 
simple tourists. Now it’s much quieter, a simple park with a few 
benches scattered around it, alternately placed so wraiths may 
gaze up at the tower or out over the sea. The tower where Charon 
resided is still there, meticulously maintained by volunteers from 
each Legion in rotation, and the lighthouse operates as always, 
needing only a handful of Artificers to tend its soulcrystal glow. 
A  popular  legend  says  that  slumbering  here  makes 
Deathsight-fueled prophetic dreams more likely. It’s likely not 
true, but that doesn’t stop curious wraiths from trying it. The 
groundskeepers try to keep slumberers off the main routes and 
otherwise let them be.
Ironville

The Seat of Shadows, home of the Iron Legion and its Ashen 
Lady, rests on the northernmost of the “seven hills” along the 
Road of Lords, and it sets the tone for the whole district. Each 
“morning” it appears as a beautiful, darkly gleaming grove of 

56

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

soulsteel and Veinous Stair stone spires, rising almost as high as 
Charon’s own Onyx Tower. As the day passes, it seems to age 
and crumble, until it is a tangle of ruins punctuated by only a 
few usable halls and chambers. Then the day begins anew and 
it renews again. Many buildings in Ironville do the same, out 
of a shared emotional resonance.

Ironville has an earned reputation as one of the most con-
servative districts in Stygia. The Iron Legion, whose members 
died of old age and the march of time, is very deeply invested 
in conserving and protecting what already exists in the Shad-
owlands. Its engineers are among the Underworld’s best when 
it comes to restoring damaged relics and Artifacts; they often 
advise in the transportation of relic buildings bound for other 
districts, but prefer that their own landscape changes as little 
possible. 

Things get discarded more slowly in Ironville than else-
where. Buildings that have sunk into the sea or been buried 
by landslides are more likely to remain in use here. Elaborate 
connecting tunnels and canopies let wraiths keep going about 
their  affairs,  with  whatever  adaptations  the  fading  buildings 
may need. This suits many wraiths of other Legions who share 
a desire to not hastily lose any of the past they still have, and 
keeps Ironville well supplied with skilled crafters, scholars, and 
entertainers in styles gone by.

Tucked into Ironville is the House of Julio and Livia, which, 
behind an unassuming façade, is one of the largest and most 
reputable dealers in relics in all of Stygia. Keen-eyed hunters 
bring their wares here, and the vast subterranean storeroom 
contains  numerous  treasures  from  across  the  ages,  for  those 
sharp enough to spot them. 

Also found in the district is the winding lane colloquially 
known as Angela Agony Avenue, named for a local Pardoner 
who  was  known  for  the  extreme  strictness  with  which  she 
ministered  to  the  locals’  Shadows.  The  screaming  from  her 
workplace could be heard up and down the street, giving her 
and the thoroughfare their respective nicknames. 
The Spine

Next in line is the Seat of Dust, home of the Skeletal Legion 
and its Skeletal Lord. The Seat of Dust sits on one of the lowest 
of the seven hills and looms over its district much less than most 
Citadels. It still sets the tone, with its unique decoration. All 
its walls are covered with a fine white filigree, which evokes 
individual bones and elaborately posed skeletons. The Legion’s 
Artificers don’t care to share the secret of its making, but it’s 
widely understood that relic bones ground to powder played 
an important part. What is known for sure is that the Legion’s 
relic buyers offer the best prices for relic bones in any condition.
One way the Skeletal Lord distinguishes his Citadel from 
the others is his lack of accommodation for personal concerns. 
There are some Pardoners in residence, like everywhere else 
wraiths gather in large numbers. But the Seat of Dust is not 
a place for wraiths to go to get help dealing with their Pas-

sions and Fetters, or anything else concerning their individual 
existences. It’s all about business in the here and now. Partly, 
this is because of the nature of the Legion: Dying of disease or 
illness is likely to leave a wraith feeling less than sentimental 
about the old home up above. Partly it’s the temperament of 
the Skeletal Lord in particular.

The same general attitude prevails throughout the district. 
The Spine has more soulforged construction and fewer promi-
nent relics than the rest of Stygia. Its entertainers present fewer 
works of comedy and drama taken from the Skinlands, opting 
for  more  original  works  dealing  with  themes  of  Underworld 
history and philosophy. There’s inevitably trade in relics and 
Artifacts because wraiths share needs and wants regardless of 
ideology, but Spine merchants are most interested in discoveries 
from explorers willing to go out into the vast Tempest — and 
below — despite the Legions’ interest in discouraging amateur 
helldiving. The Spine provides many of Stygia’s best practitioners 
of Argos, their affinity for their here-and-now giving them an 
edge in sensing the constantly changing weather.

In public, the Skeletal Lord professes loyalty to Charon’s 
dictates, including the one suppressing dangerous cultic beliefs, 
and he means them… but in his own way. It’s an open secret 
that he believes himself to be, literally, Pestilence the horse-
man of the apocalypse from the Book of Revelation. The Spine 
is relatively welcoming to wraiths with heterodox views. Its 
patrols will interfere with too-public displays of banned belief 
but prefer to ignore private practice. This attitude contributes 
to  the  Spine  having  a  relatively  small  fraction  of  Skeletal 
deathmarked wraiths; unbelievers and dissenters from all the 
other Legions like to gather here.

The most prominent sign of this unusual attitude toward 
belief is the now-closed Temple of the Fishers. For 16 centuries, 
it was the preeminent gathering place for wraiths who retained 
some form of Christian faith. It was closed along with all the 
lesser temples when it turned out that the Fisher leaders were 
running  false  paradises  and  slave  states  out  among  the  Far 
Shores. Today, the Spine’s patrols discourage everything that 
suggests worship on temple grounds, but they don’t interfere 
with the tourists who come to see relic churches gathered from 
all across the Dark Kingdom and melded into a single edifice.
Also found in the domain of the Skeletal Lord is one of 
the  more  puzzling  and  notorious  spots  in  Stygia,  the  house 
known only as “Mog’s.” Named after the last wraith to dwell 
there (and emerge intact), it’s a nondescript house in a non-
descript neighborhood. However, something lurks beyond its 
door such that anyone who goes in does not come out. Experts 
have theorized it’s perhaps a Nihil, or that possibly some form 
of  plasmic  creature  is  trapped  inside,  but  no  one,  including 
a  squad  of  heavily  armed  centurions,  has  returned  from  the 
threshold to report on what they found. Instead, the Skeletal 
Lord had the door boarded up and the site placed under guard, 
but every so often an intrepid and foolish wraith finds a way 
in, if not a way out.

The Seat of Burning Waters, home of the Grim Legion and 
its Smiling Lord, is not a nice place even by Stygian standards. 
It takes its tone from the Smiling Lord’s throne room, where a 
flaming moat separates his seat from the rest of the chamber. 
Screams are more common in Stygia than many wraiths would 
like, but in that room, screams are constant as tormented souls 
char on their way to Oblivion. Fire and images of punishment 
loom throughout the Citadel, reminding everyone what’s at stake.
The Grim Legion, for the victims of violence, shares a dis-
tinctive problem with the Penitent Legion. In both cases, the 
deathmarks bring in perpetrators and their victims alike. Killers 
and the murdered both belong in Hangtown, as far as the forces 
behind  the  deathmarks  are  concerned,  and  the  Smiling  Lord 
doesn’t challenge fate in this regard. Every marked wraith has a 
place here. This creates constant friction, since few victims ever 
get comfortable (or want to try to) with the ones responsible for 
their deaths. To maintain civic order, the Grim Legion’s patrols 
in Hangtown promote a very elaborate, very careful etiquette, 
similar to the worried carefulness surrounding medieval knights. 
Offenses against the unwritten rules give the patrols an excuse 
to haul offenders away before the underlying tensions explode.
It works, more or less. There are few public outbreaks of 
violence in Hangtown. Wraiths who just can’t stand the charade 
are at liberty to move to other districts, or to join the Grim 
Legion’s many ventures that offer them chances to go ahead and 
vent their violent emotions elsewhere. There are always calls 
for Legionnaires willing to defend the walls of the Necropoli, 
for example, and a steady flow of Hangtown’s finest goes out 
to the Shadowlands. 

The one major outlet within Hangtown is entertainment. 
If it’s formally organized as sport, theater, or other recreation, 
and if its managers keep the violence contained, then just about 
anything  goes.  Revenge  tragedies  and  Grand  Guignol  plays 
(including ones organized on “be an actor for a day” lines that 
provide minimal coaching), gladiatorial bouts, extreme sports 
that allow contestants to interfere with each other — they all 
let some of the bloodlust out. Then the entertainment finishes 
and everyone goes back to their rigid politeness.

A more serious landmark within Hangtown is Michael V. 
Roberts’ Passage. Named for the soldier who singlehandedly 
held it against spectral hordes during the last Great Maelstrom, 
it is an otherwise-unassuming passageway that opens up to the 
open-air market of Malavis Square. Particularly sensitive wraiths 
claim traces of heroism still cling to the cobblestones of the 
passageway, and that if you listen carefully, you can hear the 
echoes of sword on sword and desperate combat.

Hangtown spreads around the Library. The Smiling Lord 
would love to control it, but learned long ago that he couldn’t 
fend off all challengers. The district patrols take care not to 
infringe on Library grounds — the Library patrols often choose 
not to share in Hangtown’s unique customs, and resist intrud-
ers vigorously.

The Seat of Succor, home of the Penitent Legion and the 
Laughing Lady, dominates the district of Sanctuary. The vaga-
ries of erosion and Maelstrom damage carved canyons that let 
wraiths almost everywhere in the district get a good look at the 
place, and an informal, but very strong, tradition discourages 
new construction that would block existing sight lines. It’s the 
least ornate of the Citadels, resembling nothing so much as a 
very large hospital or asylum. There are now no visible signs of 
the damage it suffered during the Grim Legion’s revolt in the 
Great War; the Laughing Lady simply oversaw its reconstruc-
tion on exactly the same principles as before.

The most unsettling feature of the Seat of Succor, for most 
visitors, is the voices. Unseen souls, or their echoes, or some 
other source altogether, fill the Seat with constant laughter, none 
of it actually happy. There are laughs that turn into screams, 
laughs that turn into tears, laughs that turn into shouting in 
unknown languages, and more. Wraiths whose duties require 
them to spend a lot of time here come away much more centered 
than they might have dreamed possible.

Like the Grim Legion, the Penitent Legion has the problem 
of dealing with perpetrators and victims who share a deathmark. 
The solution favored by the authorities in Sanctuary is exactly 
the  opposite  of  the  one  in  Hangtown:  they  encourage  con-
frontation, public and private, with all affected parties given a 
chance to air their grievances. In Sanctuary, long-time residents 
explain to newcomers, everything comes with recriminations. 
The officials in the Seat of Succor say that this tempers the 
whole Legion, along with anyone else who chooses to exist with 
this discipline, and keeps small challenges from becoming big 
crises. And if it has the side effect of keeping things unusually 
vigorous (“lively,” the locals say when they feel ironic), that’s 
just the cost of doing business.

Sanctuary has some impressive relics, including the largest 
continuous plot of undeveloped land in the city, parcels that 
used to be a favorite of Dionysian cults in southern Greece. It’s 
also known for having Stygia’s biggest circles of helldivers and 
their collections of stolen Angst stored in caves, basements, 
and other places the Sanctuary patrols aren’t likely to look. The 
residents include many wraiths unusually willing to talk about 
their experiences with damaged thinking, dark passions, and 
the personal fight against Oblivion, whether or not they are 
Penitent themselves. The district has a well-earned reputation 
for being the place for wraiths who struggle to survive to come 
and find both understanding and help.
Newtown

The Seat of Silence, home to the Silent Legion and its Quiet 
Lord, lives up to its name, on the outside. The Citadel shares 
the Legion’s overall mission, helping those who died because of 
suicide, despair, martyrdom, and other forms of self-destruction. 
All around the Citadel, a persistent quiet holds sway, and a 
dense fog often gathers on the hill no matter what the weather 

58

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

is like in the rest of Stygia. The Quiet Lord says this gives those 
considering time there a private realm in which to make their 
choice. It’s much noisier inside, as the sounds of constant grief 
fill every nook and cranny. Wraiths who come here for help 
must each mourn in their own way, through whatever stages or 
phases each one needs, until they’ve gotten to a point of calm 
where the Legion’s Castigators can help them establish a new 
foundation for life.

Newtown is second only to the Spine when it comes to 
favoring Underworld-based buildings and activities. The Spine 
is built around a harsh rejection of sentiment; Newtown rises 
around the belief that the old life still matters, but that new 
existence calls for new objects of desire. The district is home 
to experiments in architecture, Corpus presentation, and the 
design of all sorts of equipment, all starting with the principle 
that there’s no need to imitate Skinlands precedents anymore. 
Newtown is the place to go to see genuinely new things.

The long-term population of Newtown is lower than in 
the other east-side districts. The transient population is huge, 
however,  because  Newtown’s  experiments  in  design  include 
massive docks and airfields. A traveler to Stygia who hasn’t 
specified some other point of arrival is very likely to disembark 
in Newtown, and many wraiths with nothing else to do at the 
moment like to watch the crowds come and go.
Whilestown

The Seat of Thorns, home to the Emerald Legion and its 
Emerald Lord, would dominate its section of the Road of Lords 
like no other Citadel, if only it were visible. It’s a unique complex, 
making use of countless thousands of green crystals, gathered 
from the Labyrinth at great cost, to illuminate all its sides and 
angles. But the Emerald Lord has chosen to cover all the rest 
of its hilltop with a maze of briars — carefully bred from the 
riverside trees —  a full mile across; anyone who has business 
with the Seat of Thorns has to budget the time to maneuver the 
maze, even if they have an expert guide on hand. The Emerald 
Lord remembers what civil wars and Great Maelstroms are like 
and has decided to do everything he can to ensure that he and 
his Legion can survive whatever may come next.

Whilestown reflects the nature of the Emerald Legion, those 
who’ve died by happenstance, even in its name. The archetypal 
story of how a wraith ended up with Emerald deathmarks be-
gins, “One day, while I was just minding my own business….” 
Whilestown is the place wraiths gather to do something else 
with less fear of dying this time around. The Legion is large, but 
its presence in Stygia is relatively small, with most Legion activ-
ity happening elsewhere. The Emerald Lord seems comfortable 
with the idea of his district being Stygia’s “odds and ends” place.
If a wraith needs an Artificer as innovative as the ones in 
the Spine but more interested in mortal precedents, a scholar as 
informed as the Library’s but less likely to make an acquisitive 
lunge at rare manuscripts, someone with access to illicit stores 
of Angst without the tragic histories so common in Sanctuary, 
Whilestown is the place to come look. It acts as an escape valve 

for social pressures elsewhere on Stygia, since nobody excels 
at keeping diverse misfits together like the Emerald Legion.

There’s  an  informal  theme  of  unexpected  synthesis  in 
Whilestown relic and local construction. Legion forces work by 
seeking complements among people who had nothing in com-
mon and forging bonds between them, and they apply the same 
principle to urban design. Buildings fused together, or stacked 
on top of each other, or inserted one into another like a wedge 
dropped from above, all help Whilestown maintain the look 
that many visitors expect all of Stygia to have.

The same principle affects the way Whilestown wraiths 
do  business.  Almost  every  business  is  a  bit  of  this  and  a  bit 
of  that:  a  warehouse  block  and  a  dating/escort  service  with 
an index of wraiths with exotic Passions, a market square for 
vendors unable to afford their own permanent addresses and an 
outfitter specializing in Tempest-resilient gear for hermits and 
explorers, a jitney depot and an office of Pardoners who offer 
expert advice in religious practices both legal and otherwise. 
Some reflect a single wraith’s interests, while many emerge out 
of chance partnerships.
South End

The Seat of Golden Tears, home of the Legion of Paupers and 
the Beggar Lord, occupies the tallest of the seven hills and sets 
the tone for the whole southern end of Stygia. It’s a constantly 
shifting jumble of semi-independent buildings and fractions of 
buildings, which rise and fall, rotate, and move in response to 
unheard commands that follow no discernable routine. Of all 
the Citadels, it’s the one that makes guides most necessary, and 
even so, there’s no shortage of true tales of those who came up 
to the Citadel on business and were never seen again.

The Legion of Paupers takes in those whose deaths are in 
some way mysterious: those who have no memory of how they 
died, those who died in circumstances where they lost control 
but  don’t  fit  the  criteria  for  the  Penitent  Legion,  and  those 
who died in ways that make them eligible for several Legions 
at once. The Paupers get the wraiths that Deathlords’ repre-
sentatives in reaping grounds would otherwise fight over. The 
district of South End provides a similar function for the city of 
Stygia, taking in wraiths, relics, and other odds and ends that 
nobody else wanted to keep, but that nobody felt motivated 
enough to destroy. 

South End residents and patrols share an attitude about 
outsiders. It’s usually expressed as “If you’re just here to look 
around, goodbye.” The wraiths in this district take the oppor-
tunity to make something good out of others’ leavings seriously, 
but they’re making them for their own kind, not for the benefit 
of those who may well have done the original throwing away. 
Travelers who come to South End had better have a clear mis-
sion and a local contact if they want to avoid trouble.

There aren’t many grand relics on display in South End. 
Luxury, the residents point out in tones from whining to raging, 
is for those who don’t have to make do with others’ leftovers. 
The South End inheritance is more modest, and includes many 

SETTING

59

small remains whose purpose was misunderstood by later dis-
coverers: the “temple” that’s actually an ancient sewer system, 
the “cemetery” whose pillars were actually part of an elaborate 
ball game, the “royal library” that was actually a black-market 
warehouse that flooded just after receiving a big haul. When it 
comes to new construction, the district’s Arcanos masters love 
to make use of the rival flows of emotion and desire in objects 
subject to intense, but incompatible, understandings.

A particularly grim neighborhood landmark is a building 
with a blank façade that most wraiths go out of their way to 
avoid. It is a prison, where wraiths of particular interest to the 
Beggar Lord are held and questioned. There are rarely more 
than a few wraiths resident within the frowning confines at any 
given time; a place in what is known as Antonius Giovanni’s 
House is reserved for those few who really catch the Beggar 
Lord’s  attention.  The  fact  that  the  building  is  named  for  a 
vampire only adds to its sinister air; stories as to why this is swirl 
like dead leaves. Some say the vampire held the Beggar Lord 
himself captive at one point and the name is a reminder to the 
Deathlord that even the mightiest can be humbled. Others say 
Giovanni struck a deal with the Beggar Lord and instructed the 
questioners who work there in certain persuasive techniques. 

And there are those who say the vampire has incurred the Beggar 
Lord’s special ire, and that all that is done behind the walls is 
done in the interest of finding, and dealing with, the vampire. 
Iron Hills

For most of Stygia’s history, the Iron Hills hosted massive 
villas and the occasional business or commune that didn’t want 
to deal with district patrols. That formally changed early in the 
20th century, when Charon decreed that they were now directly 
the property of the Onyx Tower and would be developed to 
provide homes for the ever-swelling population. The existing 
residents received generous payments and vigorous shoves.

As soon as the Fourth Great Maelstrom settled down, Stygian 
architects and engineers went to work assembling relic bridges and 
new construction into massive causeways to cover the mile between 
the southernmost island and the nearest convenient points on the 
main island. The north route begins just below the Onyx Tower 
and makes a gradual curve to face northeast, while the south route 
starts at Riverside between Ironville and the Spine. Each route 
makes use of the one of the openings in the seawall. They can be 
safely closed in a matter of hours, or slammed shut for emergencies 
in minutes, at the cost of needed rebuilding later.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Half a million wraiths now reside on the Iron Hills, with 
more  arriving  all  the  time.  Their  residential  conditions  are 
almost always bad, using whatever relics others didn’t claim 
and whatever shelter can be cobbled together from the River of 
Death’s endless drift. What does work, to the surprise of many 
skeptical outsiders, are the social conditions.

Everyone  on  the  Iron  Hills  realizes  that  they  exist  in  a 
very fragile situation. Anything that required closing the sea-
wall would leave them on the wrong side, and there’s plenty 
of trouble that can do great harm without rising to that level. 
Charon gave them what support he could; the Deathlords don’t 
actively wish the Iron Hills any harm, it’s just that other places, 
starting with their own districts, get more attention. So the Iron 
Hills wraiths’ only reliable resource is each other. They’re where 
the true flotsam and jetsam of Stygia wash up: the disgraced, 
the destitute, the dreamers who don’t have anything to offer 
that the isle wants. And naturally, this cauldron of seekers and 
exiles  can  be  a  fertile  source  of  plots,  unexpected  alliances, 
and agents of outside powers. Spies and self-described freedom 
fighters  are  everywhere  here,  and  heretical  cults  thrive,  yet 
somehow the community always still manages to pull together 
and protect its own.

One of the most notorious haunts of self-styled revolution-
aries is the Brian Quinn Estates, an apartment building that 
burned to the ground in 1987 and was transported in its entirety 
to the Iron Hills. For some unknown reason, revolutionaries 
and Renegades always converge on it, and a half-dozen cabals 
are active within its walls at any given time. The authorities 
know this and raid the place on a semi-regular basis, but as soon 
as the heat is off a new batch settles in.

Also found in the Iron Hills is Nikink’s, a dive of a Pathos 
bar that’s got a reputation for accepting one and all, as long as 
they behave themselves. Guildwraiths rub elbows with high-
ranking Hierarchs and Heretics pass the time with would-be 
Inquisitors. Much of the unofficial business of the empire is 
conducted  in  its  cramped  and  crowded  rooms,  and  it’s  even 
rumored that one or two of the Deathlords regularly patronize 
the place. 

Less salubrious is a wrecked villa that, even in the cramped 
Iron Hills, is given a wide berth. Colloquially known as The 
House Aludian Thex Built, it belonged to a wealthy Artificer 
named  Nicholas  Vandemaele-Couchy,  who  had  an  arrange-
ment with the ancient vampire whose name adorned his home. 
The secret to Vandemaele-Couchy’s wealth lay in the regular 
deliveries of Enfants Thex provided across the centuries. The 
Artificer’s agents received the souls of those Thex dispatched at 
a regular Shadowlands rendezvous. In exchange for this bounty, 
Vandemaele-Couchy  made  certain  there  were  no  vengeful 
wraiths waiting for the ancient Lasombra on the other side of 
the Shroud, nor would there be any interference from those 
whose hatred of the vampire proved stronger than their fear of 
breaking the Dictum Mortuum.

Necropoli

A Necropolis is the standard term for a Hierarchy outpost 
in  the  Shadowlands,  usually  overlaying  some  mortal  city  or 
other. At the heart of the Necropolis is the Citadel, a fortified 
central redoubt made from the ghosts of destroyed buildings 
and hardened against Maelstroms and other spectral attacks. 
Normally they are found in desolate or decayed areas, but as 
waves of gentrification swept through cities, many Anacreons 
moved their operations to historic sites and the like that are 
less likely to become construction sites overnight.

Generally a Necropolis claims authority over the Shadow-
lands of an entire city, though there are rare cases of multiple 
Citadels springing up in particularly crowded areas. Back when 
Brooklyn was an independent city, it had its own Necropolis, 
but since it was absorbed into New York as one of the five bor-
oughs, there’s been constant bureaucratic warfare between the 
original New York Citadel and the Brooklyn one as to whether 
one has authority over the other.

All wraiths who are within a Necropolis’ borders are consid-
ered to be under the authority of that Necropolis and its ruling 
wraiths. Depending on the Necropolis’ size, some or all of the 
Legions may have a representative in place. The highest-ranking 
wraiths in a Necropolis hold the title of Anacreon, and it is the 
council of Anacreons that directs policy in times of peace and 
defense in times of war and Maelstrom. Of course, all Anacreons 
are not created equal, nor are all Necropoli, and the balance 
of power within a given city can shift based upon the Legion 
allegiances of its wraithly population or the political skills of the 
local Anacreons. Each Anacreon holds ultimate responsibility 
for the wraiths of their Legion within the Necropolis.

Every Necropolis is also garrisoned by armed and armored 
Legionnaires, ready to defend the Citadel at a moment’s notice 
against any threats. In theory, the territory of every Necropolis 
is walled, though as cities expand, overburdened Anacreons 
are  often  forced  to  pick  and  choose  which  sections  of  their 
city to protect.
Notable Necropoli
Edinburgh
Edinburgh is often called, without irony, the model Ne-
cropolis.  Laid  out  by  noted  architect  Sir  William  Bruce,  it 
features a central Citadel with equal quarters for each of the 
eight Legions, and a strong series of fortifications around the 
Necropolis perimeter that have withstood numerous spectral 
assaults.

The council of Anacreons in Edinburgh currently includes 
representatives from all eight of the Legions, with the Anacreon 
of Fate having only recently arrived as a replacement for their 
unfortunately Harrowed predecessor. Debate is often heated, 
but once a decision is reached on matters of policy, the Council 

SETTING

61

stands together to back it no matter what an individual’s opin-
ion might have been. Likewise, they move in lockstep when it 
comes to the interpretation of Stygian law, whether it be the 
persecution of too-obvious Guildwraiths or prescriptions on how 
newly arrived Enfants are to be treated. Those who violate the 
laws, regardless of personal status or connection, are sentenced 
to nights in the so-called “soul cages,” soulsteel contraptions 
that swing in the Niddry vaults below the city. The greater the 
crime, the longer the stay. And since there’s something down 
in those vaults that’s fond of ripping wraiths to shreds on odd 
occasions, most would prefer to avoid the experience. Repeat 
offenders don’t get a third chance, but instead are packed off 
straight to the forges.

The reason for this level of cooperation is simple: The city 
is built on an ancient volcano, and the old crater at Arthur’s 
Seat houses a Nihil that opens into the Labyrinth. Packs of 
Spectres make constant attempts to breach the city’s defenses, 
and  a  very  few  succeed.  With  such  an  existential  threat  on 
their  borders,  the  Anacreons  long  ago  recognized  that  they 
didn’t have time for partisan bickering. Each new addition to 
the Council is briefed on what her real duties are and where 
her real loyalties must lie — with the city, first and foremost, 
and devil take the words of a faraway Deathlord with no idea 
what might be about to bubble up into the street. 

The Citadel itself is set onto the lower volcanic hill of Castle 
Rock, at the end of the Royal Mile. In case of emergency or 
Maelstrom, there are prominently posted evacuation routes for 
wraiths posted around the city, and there are even occasional 
(and not always well attended) practice drills. 

Despite its reputation as being haunted (as well as a home 
of  other  high  strangeness),  Rosslyn  Chapel  has  been  placed 
strictly off-limits to the local wraith population. Why, none 
of the Anacreons will say, but what is known is that wraiths 
who sneak past the sentries and into the chapel itself rarely 
emerge  the  same  as  when  they  entered.  Some  are  prone  to 
strange manias, while others immediately flee the Necropolis for 
points unknown. None will speak of the experience inside the 
chapel except in the broadest possible terms, and they cannot 
be coerced into giving up its secrets. 

Los Angeles
If you want to see stars — dead ones, anyway — the Los 
Angeles Necropolis is where you should go. There’s no shortage 
of the famous, the almost famous, and the would-have-been 
famous working behind Citadel walls. Sharp-eyed visitors will 
recognize more than one movie star in the Necropolis, such as 
Fatty Arbuckle working side by side with Frances Farmer, or 
Howard Hughes negotiating with Bugsy Siegel over the alloca-
tion of soulsteel from the city’s forges to its Legions. Feasting 
on the Memoriam generated by their mortal success, the stars 
have risen to the top of the Necropolis pecking order, and a 
certain glitzy, glamorous veneer overlays the whole enterprise.
Underneath, of course, is the seedier side. Dealmakers and 
spin doctors, fixers and crooked agents, they’re the real grease 

that makes the Necropolis run. And then there are the movers 
and shakers, the land barons and hustlers who drew the maps of 
the city while they were alive and hunger for similar power now 
that they’re dead. The stars may have the name recognition, 
but operators like Pen Timbletom and Walt “Cabbie” Karmanik 
are the ones wraiths in the know respect and fear.

Ironically, the heart of the Los Angeles Necropolis is not 
actually located in Los Angeles proper. There’s simply no room 
for it there — there’s too many people and the real estate is too 
crowded to allow for it. Rather, the Citadel was built in the 
nearby community of Vernon, amongst warehouses and factories. 
The other interesting fact about the Los Angeles Necropolis 
is that it’s not actually run by the Legions. Instead, L.A. is a 
Guild town, with the Masquers ascendant. It’s an open secret 
among Guildwraiths that L.A. is where you go if you want to 
avoid getting hassled by Legionnaires, or if you want to practice 
your arts openly and without risk of being hauled off to the 
forges because of it. Diandra Coulson, head of the local chapter 
of the Masquers’ Guild, has worked hard to bend the power 
structure to his will, largely by co-opting potential rivals into 
the Guild structure and thus making his enemies into de facto 
allies. Those he can’t subvert he isolates; Althea Prescott, the 
Anacreon for the Penitent Legion, refused Coulson’s entreat-
ies and remains firmly non-Guild, but all four of the Overlords 
working for her gave in to Coulson’s blandishments, effectively 
neutralizing their boss. 

If Coulson does have a rival, it’s Harrison Gray Otis, a ris-
ing star in the Iron Legion who, in his breathing days, helped 
build Los Angeles into the metropolis it is today. Ruthless and 
deeply distrustful of the Guilds, Otis has the tacit backing of the 
Stygian elite to try to reclaim control of the city. His right-hand 
wraith, Ezekiel O’Brien, is notoriously cutthroat and ruthless, 
even by Los Angeles standards, and a visit from O’Brien is as 
feared as the ringing of the Maelstrom bells.

One unique element of the Los Angeles Necropolis is its 
trolleys. The ghostly cars serve all areas of the Necropolis, fol-
lowing over 1,000 miles of track laid down in their heyday in 
the Skinlands. Travel is free to any resident of the Necropolis; 
outsiders must pay a fee — or have a resident vouch for them. 
In the Skinlands, the city is home to innumerable oil wells, 
with the rigs pumping away day and night. Some even operate 
downtown, behind building facades designed to hide them from 
view. And where they have drilled down in the Skinlands, in 
the  Shadowlands  many  are  host  to  perpetually  open  Nihils 
that lead to the Tempest or, in some cases, the Labyrinth itself. 
Many — including the largest, at the La Brea tar pits — are 
guarded against the possibility of something untoward coming 
through, especially in case of a Maelstrom. But more and more 
are opening, and there aren’t enough Legionnaires to stand guard 
at all of them. Sooner or later, something will slip through.

Paris
Most Necropoli tower above the local Shadowlands, rising 
up to dominate the Underworld landscape. Not so in Paris, where 

62

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

the entirety of the Necropolis is located underground. Only 
a small portion of the famous Paris catacombs are open to 
the public; the rest are claimed by the dead as their own. 
Some have compared the Paris Necropolis to an anthill, 
with its miles of underground tunnels and endless waves 
of scurrying wraiths going about the city’s business. The 
denizens of Paris take the comparison with a wry smile, 
well aware that their “anthill” has withstood the worst the 
Great Maelstroms could throw at it far better than other 
cities — including Stygia.

The  Necropolis  is  ruled  by  Sébastien  Le  Prestre  de 
Vauban, the legendary Marshal of France and Anacreon 
of the Grim Legion. While all of the other Legions are 
represented in the ruling councils of Paris, it is de Vauban 
who has the final say on all matters of import. His troops, 
while  technically  outnumbered  by  the  representatives 
of other Legions, are elite, and take the forefront in any 
conflict. This includes any fights against Spectres and any 
internal strife, which de Vauban puts down ruthlessly and 
efficiently.

Perhaps his greatest contribution to the once-fractious 
Necropolis, however, is the modernization of its defenses. At 
the first hint of an incursion, the tunnels become a deathtrap 
for any hostile forces, be they wraith, Spectre or something 
worse. Spikes of plasm-rending Stygian steel emerge from 
the walls. Impassible barriers slam down, funneling attackers 
to choke points where they can be captured or destroyed 
en masse. It is a point of pride among the Parisian dead 
that no spectral assault has ever breached their Citadel, 
and they remain confident that none ever will.

Not everyone is happy with the current arrangement. 
A collective of wraiths, most dating to the days of the Paris 
Commune, have set up an alternative Necropolis on the 
grounds of the Pere Lachaise cemetery. They’ve attracted a 
somewhat sizable following, though it’s long on bureaucrats 
and short on soldiers. For his part, de Vauban is content 
to let the rabble-rousers congregate there, where he can 
keep an eye on the lot of them.

While the Necropolis proper is set up in the tunnels, 
there are outposts elsewhere in the city. Taking advantage 
of Paris’ history — and its booming tourist trade — the 
Hierarchy has fortified outposts at many of the city’s most 
famous sites. These are set up for the express purpose of 
collecting  Pathos  from  awestruck  visitors.  The  Louvre, 
Montmartre, the Eiffel Tower and more are endless sources 
of powerful emotion, and the Hierarchy prudently harvests 
as much of it as possible. These outposts are obvious targets 
for raiders, and each has a heavy complement of Legion-
naires attached to it. 

If there is one spot in Paris, however, that even de 
Vauban’s shock troops dare not go, it’s La Colonne Médici. 
Originally built as an observatory and apartment for her 
court astronomer by Catherine de Médici, the tower stands 
near the booming commercial district (for the living and 

SETTING

the dead) of Les Halles. It has, however, a sinister reputation 
that dates back the last days of the Valois dynasty, one that is 
well deserved. Spectres haunt the site, and every attempt to 
cleanse them from this place has met with disaster. At the heart 
of the tower sits the ghost of Cosme Ruggieri, once Catherine’s 
chief astrologer and advisor. Now, however, Ruggieri has been 
transformed into a powerful Shade, and he hungers to control 
far more of the city than he currently does. 

Philadelphia
The City of Brotherly Love is largely known for two things: 
being the site of the origins of the United States of America, and 
the one time local sports fans threw snowballs at a guy dressed like 
Santa Claus. Both of these elements infuse the city’s Necropolis, 
where a jury-rigged series of alliances keeps things simultaneously 
operational and on the brink of disaster.

The  main  Citadel,  and  the  home  to  Anacreons  of  the 
Emerald, Penitent, and Silent Legions, is built in the center 
of Eastern State Penitentiary. Once a functioning prison with 
an  experimental  design,  it’s  now  a  tourist  site  —  and  has  a 
reputation for being haunted. The three Legions based there 
formed an unlikely alliance, and serve as the central axis of 
power around which the Necropolis turns.

However, there’s a secondary, smaller Citadel in Fairmont 
Park, home to the Skeletal and Iron Legion representatives and 
their subordinates. Led by the wraith of the indomitable abo-
litionist (and now Anacreon of the Skeletal Legion) Lucretia 
Mott, this group seeks to end Thralldom within the Philadel-
phia  Necropolis.  A  fierce  pacifist  in  life,  post-mortem  Mott 
has no qualms about doing whatever it takes to achieve what 
she views as the greater good. As a result, the troops from this 
secondary Necropolis will occasionally raid Reapers inbound 
with freshly captured Enfants, freeing and recruiting the new 
souls to their cause. Generally, they have little trouble getting 
their point across.

The remaining Legions are slighter in numbers and maintain 
a strict neutrality when the others squabble. They count among 
their membership several of the so-called Founding Fathers, and 
can be found in a series of small fortifications around the central 
hub of Independence Mall. The strong emotional resonance from 
the founding of the country keeps these wraiths potent enough 
to ward off any attempts at coercion by the other factions, and 
it is through their offices that many of the deals necessary to 
keep the figurative lights on get struck.

Fragmented as it is, the Philadelphia Necropolis constantly 
seems to be on the edge of disaster, and yet somehow the vary-
ing factions always find a way to come together just in time 
to avert disaster. Whether it’s fending off a spectral incursion, 
acting to influence mortals to preserve historic buildings that 
serve as Fetters for many Philadelphia wraiths (only the barest 
pretense of obeying the Dictum Mortuum is shown here. When 
questioned about it by an Inquisitor of the Unlidded Eye, a lo-
cal Legionnaire named Morgan Cook said, simply, “Screw that, 
we got work to do.”), or resisting interference from any flavor 

of Stygian central authority, the local factions can be counted 
to cooperate when it counts. It’s the rest of the time that they 
bicker, squabble, and occasionally come to blows.

In a city with a fractured Citadel, it’s not surprising that the 
nature of the Necropolis is fractured as well. Some neighborhoods 
are safe and fortified against Maelstroms, others are no-man’s 
lands  where  Renegade  gangs  and  occasional  Spectres  roam. 
There’s also a strong Heretic presence in the city. Pennsylva-
nia’s original charter forbade religious discrimination, leading 
to  many  marginalized  religious  groups  settling  there  in  the 
colony’s early days. Many of these wraiths, rather than journey 
to the Far Shores, have remained in Philadelphia, particularly 
those of the Quaker faith. As for the Renegades, the Benjamin 
Rush House hosts the largest gang, a collection of victims of 
the yellow fever epidemic of 1793 who’ve split off from the 
Skeletal Legion over a refusal to take orders from Mott. Led 
by firebrand orator James McGregor, they stubbornly cling to 
their independence and remain a constant thorn in Mott’s side.

Rome
Rome might not be the oldest of the European Necropoli, 
but it’s certainly among the largest and most prestigious. Huge 
chunks of the architecture of Stygia were pulled from the Shad-
owlands of Rome and its environs, granting the isle a classical 
majesty that even today informs its architecture and layout. 

With  its  preservation  of  so  many  Roman-era  treasures, 
however, Rome also offers wraiths of a certain age something 
not many places can: secure Fetters going back millennia. In 
practical  terms,  this  means  that  the  city’s  politics  are  domi-
nated by wraiths who were contemporaries of Julius Caesar or 
Claudius. This in turn means that those in charge in the city 
wield almost unheard-of power, as few wraiths of their age can 
endure the Shadowlands for long. Younger wraiths looking to 
climb the ladder have only two options: Make powerful friends, 
or wait a very long time.

The  flip  side  of  having  very  old  wraiths  in  charge  of  a 
Necropolis  is  that  they  have  very  long  memories,  and  the 
elder wraiths of Rome remember the sack of the city as if it 
were yesterday. As such, they remain eternally vigilant against 
even the slightest threats to the city, and they will act swiftly 
and decisively to neutralize them. And if they get it wrong and 
accidentally take out an innocent or three, that’s just the cost 
of doing business.

While all eight Legions are represented in the main Cita-
del, the real core of power rests with the representatives of the 
Grim Legion. Made up of a hard core of generals and military 
personnel going all the way back to Caesar’s legions, they are 
ruthless, disciplined, and in lockstep as to how to handle the 
city’s problems. The Anacreon is the venerable and brilliant 
Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, who combines a strong sense of civic 
duty with a superb tactical mind. Leading the opposition is the 
Anacreon of Fate, the legendary orator Hortensia, backed by the 
Pauper Anacreon Idrin and, silently, several others. Normally 
the Ladies of Fate dislike intervening in city-level politics, but

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Rome is of such importance to Stygia that orders came down 
from the isle to take a direct hand in matters, else the Grim 
Legion would run amok. 

The main Citadel is located on the grounds of the Colos-
seum, but the city is so huge there are smaller citadels scattered 
throughout. Each of these satellite citadels is run by an Over-
lord of the Grim Legion, who reports back to the Anacreon as 
needed but otherwise functions almost autonomously. Indeed, 
it’s almost as if there is no singular Rome Necropolis, but rather 
a collection of smaller ones under a single rubric. 

If  there  is  trouble  brewing  in  Rome,  it’s  not  from  this 
loose arrangement of citadels. Rather, it’s from the deathgrip 
that the ancients have on power in the city. As brilliant and 
civic-minded as Agrippa may be, getting him to understand 
the nature of modern communications or computing power 
is incredibly difficult. Decisions are made based on facts and 
opinions that should have long since crumbled to dust, and 
the ever-increasing number of younger wraiths have less and 
less  patience  with  it  —  and  with  their  own  powerlessness. 
Hortensia,  shrewdly,  is  aware  of  this,  and  bends  her  efforts 
toward directing the dissatisfaction squarely at the Grim Legion. 
Contrary to popular belief, Vatican City is not under the 
jurisdiction of the Rome Necropolis, and has its own walls and 
guards. Communication between the Roman Citadel and the 
Vatican one is rare and strained at best; the dead of the Vatican 
prefer to keep to themselves, and for their own reasons.
Ranks Within A Necropolis

The civilian ranks within a Necropolis are as follows:
Chancellors: Overseers of all civilian functions in a Ne-
cropolis, they report directly to Anacreons and Deathlords as 
needed.
Ministers: Heads of the various departments within a Necropolis’ 
bureaucracy.  Often  selected  by  Legion  allegiance  rather 
than special skill in a subject.

Inspectors: The civilian equivalent of Marshals, they handle 
day-to-day operations within a section of a Necropolis.
Adjusters: Equivalent to Centurions, they organize and oversee 

Clerks: The ruck and run of the civilian wraith population. 

They do the grunt work and day-to-day tasks as needed.

Clerks.

Factions

Death does not enforce uniformity of opinion. As in life, 
the dead have disagreements on how to take care of business. In 
many cases the divisions are relatively small, or overwhelmed 
by the enormity of the threat of Oblivion, and everyone agrees 
to more or less disagree. In others, however, the fractures are 
too great to be ignored.

Power in the Underworld is not broken down along equitable 
lines. In the Dark Kingdom of Iron, Stygia reigns supreme. It 
has the most wraiths, the most power, and the most wealth, by 

far. But not every wraith is willing to align with it. Those whose 
disagreements with Stygia are political are loosely grouped under 
the umbrella of Renegades, while those whose opinion is more 
religious or spiritual are often referred to as Heretics. Both fac-
tions are made up of numerous smaller groups, many of which 
have as little in common with each other as they do with Stygia. 
Intra-faction conflict is common, and groups coalesce and dis-
solve with startling rapidity. That being said, there are still places 
on the map that Stygia’s power can’t reach, and in these spots, 
others call the shots.
Renegades

As long as there has been a Stygia, there have been Ren-
egades. However, since the Third Great Maelstrom — in part 
incited by the actions of certain Renegade groups — their power 
has greatly diminished and they were forced to the fringes of 
Stygian society. Renegade groups vary in size from lone operators 
to organized, fortified encampments where Hierarchy wraiths 

FAMOUS RENEGADE GANGS

The Brotherhood of the Black Rabbit — 
Consisting of deceased stage magicians, spiritu-
alists,  and  mediums,  the  Brotherhood  seeks  to 
protect the living who deal with the dead from 
the abuses of the Hierarchy. They are led by the 
notorious Alexis Naucek.

Daughters of the Scythe — An all-female 
gang, the Daughters reject the entire premise of 
Stygia’s existence and look to bring it down so 
that something better can be built on its ashes. 
Once found only in a couple of Necropoli on the 
American west coast, they’ve now got chapters 
all across the empire.

Doyle’s Irregulars — An irregular mob of 
street-fighting  toughs  surrounding  a  hardened 
professional center, Doyle’s lads will do anything 
to anyone for the right price. Based out of the 
Boston Necropolis, they’ve been known to travel 
worldwide to finish a contract, as their word is 
their absolute bond.

Storm Riders — The pre-eminent biker gang 
of the Underworld (there are numerous others), 
the Riders reject Hierarchy authority and spend 
their time cruising Byways in a Robin Hood-like 
quest to aid the poor and downtrodden. 

The Flying Column — Dedicated to freeing 
the Dublin Necropolis from Stygian rule, this gang 
was founded by the veterans — and casualties — 
of the 1916 Easter Rising. Since then it’s added 
dozens of members, all focused on the same goal.

dare not go. Each gang shares one trait: a refusal to be part of 
the  Stygian  machine.  Beyond  that,  everything  is  up  to  the 
individual group. As a result, Renegade politics are constantly 
shifting, with various bands dissolving, merging, and splinter-
ing with alarming frequency. How each Renegade gang is run 
is also a matter of local control. Some are cults of personality, 
while others are purely democratic, and still others use trial 
by combat, feats of strength and anything else imaginable to 
determine whose word is law. Every political system the living 
ever thought of is on display among the Renegades, and quite 
a  few  more  that  they  haven’t,  and  a  wraith’s  reception  in  a 
Renegade gang can vary widely depending upon which sort of 
crowd she’s fallen in with.

By and large, Renegades exist outside of Stygian protec-
tion, in the wildlands between Necropoli. Others dwell inside 
enemy lines, hidden within Stygia itself and waiting for the 
right moment to forcibly declare their opposition. Not every 
Renegade gang is locked in mortal combat with Stygia; some 
just want to be left alone to exist in their own way, while others 
prefer an independent existence not bound by Stygia’s rules. 
But the popular — and romanticized — image of a Renegade 
is of a wraith forcibly smashing the forges of an underdefended 
Necropolis while setting the local Thralls free and declaring 
revolution. 

While  each  Renegade  gang  will  proudly  swear  they’re 
independent,  there  are  longstanding  rumors  of  a  Renegade 
Council, made up of representatives from the strongest and most 
influential Renegade bands and led by the so-called Renegade 
Lord. No one has ever laid eyes on the Renegade Lord, and 
she — if she exists — has managed to evade capture by Hier-
archy forces desperate to bring her in for centuries. Hierarchy 
strategists pooh-pooh the notion of a Renegade council, but 
their counterparts closer to the front lines note that certain 
Renegade actions have an unprecedented level of coordination 
between groups that would normally be at each other’s throats, 
and keep their counsel to themselves.

In the end, there is no such thing as the average Renegade. 
Some are Hierarchy wraiths who grew disillusioned over the 
centuries and struck out on their own. Others are activists who 
tangle with Reapers over new souls the way environmentalists 
throw themselves in front of whaling ships in the Skinlands, or 
who refuse to be part of an empire founded on the practice of 
soulforging. Still others are bomb-throwers and rabble-rousers, 
determined  to  bring  the  entire  Stygian  edifice  down  and  to 
hell with the consequences. And then there are the mercenary 
gangs, willing to do whatever for the highest bidder so long as 
they can do it on their own terms. What matters most is that

they offer an alternative to allowing one’s self to be absorbed 
into Stygian society, as perilous as that alternative might be.
Heretics

One would think that an actual, tangible afterlife would 
end all discussions of religion among the Restless Dead, and in 
doing so, one would be wrong. Innumerable groups of wraiths 
have  fallen  in  behind  charismatic  leaders  or  theologies  that 
attempt to explain the mystery of wraithly existence, leading 
to  the  relentless  rise  of  Heretic  groups  (known  as  “cults”). 
Heretics officially date back to the Proclamation of Reason, 
when Stygia pivoted away from the pursuit of Transcendence 
and the Far Shores. Those who had once been Fishers, leading 
the questing Restless across the Sea of Shadows became out-
lawed, functionally the first Heretics. And while some core of 
those ancient Fishers remains, the term has grown to mean any 
religious or spiritually-based group that stands in opposition to 
official Stygian policy. 

That doesn’t mean that the Heretics present a united front. 
Far from it — the various cults spend far more time bickering 
with one another than anything else. This is due in large part 
to the various cults’ refusal to recognize the potential validity 
of any metaphysical viewpoints other than their own. With the 
price of failure being Oblivion and the prize of success being 
Transcendence, it’s no wonder that Heretics will defend their 
way to the very doorstep of the Void. Simply put, they cannot 

NOTABLE HERETIC CULTS

The  Riders  of  the  Wheel — Substituting 
Chance for Fate, these wraiths believe gambling 
is the purest form of observance.

Children  of  the  Green  —  These  wraiths 
view the Underworld through an adaptation of 
neopagan principles. Believing their postmortem 
existence works as a sort of balance to the living 
world,  they  strive  to  achieve  peace,  eliminate 
soulforging, and otherwise provide a moral coun-
terweight to all of the horrible acts committed 
in the Underworld. 

The Host — These wraiths believe them-
selves reborn as guardian angels for the living, and 
act as such in deliberate defiance of the Dictum 
Mortuum. One of the most widespread Heretic 
groups, they have spread across various Necropoli 
with lightning speed. They are led by a mysterious 
wraith known only as Michel, whose capture is a 
Hierarchy priority.

The Cult of Nhudri — Contained within 
the  Artificers’  Guild,  this  cult  views  the  great 
smith Nhudri as a divine figure worthy of worship. 
What Nhudri himself thinks of this is not known.

THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY

Just because they both stand against Stygia 
doesn’t mean Spectres and Renegades are natural 
allies. Some Renegade gangs do make the devil’s 
bargain  and  hook  up  with  the  Shadow-Eaten 
against their mutual foe, but by and large these 
groups end up betrayed by their erstwhile allies, 
hauled down into the Labyrinth, sold out to Hier-
archs for the feast of panicky Angst this generates, 
or Shadow-Eaten themselves. Only a rare few can 
manage  the  balancing  act  of  taking  assistance 
from the Labyrinth without being devoured by it. 
It’s far more likely for Renegades and Hierarchs 
or Heretics to stand together against Oblivion’s 
threat,  then  go  back  to  brutalizing  each  other 
once the greater danger has passed. 

afford to be wrong, and they cannot allow those who are wrong 
to mislead others or all might pay the price. 

Today,  most  Hierarchs  view  Transcendence  as  a  myth, 
and Heretics as fools or propagandists for clinging to the no-
tion. Heretics, on the other hand, feel this approach has been 
inculcated by the Hierarchy to keep them from losing souls to 
whatever lies beyond. Some Heretic cults attempt to recruit 
from  amongst  the  poor  and  disaffected  in  Stygia;  it  is  these 
groups that the Legions crack down on harshly.

As with Renegades, Heretic groups come in all shapes and 
sizes.  Many  answer  to  a  single  charismatic  figure  who  leads 
the  cult,  setting  the  rules  and  making  decisions  as  needed. 
Others  are  more  rigidly  formal,  with  rites  and  customs  that 
have  been  handed  down  through  the  centuries.  Still  others 
have more ecstatic approaches, believing that pure emotion 
is the surest route to Transcendence. In any case, few Heretic 
cults are openly welcome inside the walls of even the smallest 
Necropolis. Instead, they build their temples and shrines in the 
contested badlands shared with Renegades, or in humble and 
hidden places within Stygian cities. 
The Hierarchy

The Hierarchy is not Stygia, but Stygia could not survive 
without the Hierarchy. Instead, the Hierarchy is the term for 
the organization that supports the Dark Kingdom of Iron and 
keeps it functioning from day to day. It’s the vast network of 
clerks, soldiers, pilots, accountants, bureaucrats, and other souls 
who keep the Underworld from devolving into total chaos, and 
they take their work very seriously.

Founded by Charon as a way of formalizing and unifying 
the  afterlife,  the  Hierarchy  has  grown  far  beyond  his  initial 
conception. The Legions have crossed oceans and claimed new 
territories, the bureaucracy has expanded beyond all compre-

SETTING

67

hension, and still more souls flood in and need a place — a 
safe, comfortable place — to dwell lest Oblivion claim them. 
That is what every loyal Hierarch tells herself is the true 
goal  of  the  faction:  keeping  Oblivion  at  bay.  Every  effort  is 
theoretically bent toward this end, from manning the walls to 
providing new Enfants with a welcoming reception in and easy 
transition to the afterlife, to forging criminals to prevent them 
from becoming Shadow-Eaten.

The truth, as always, is somewhat more complicated. It’s 
not just criminals who get sent to the forges, and too many 
wraiths end up as Thralls. A culture of corruption and incom-
petence has grown up in the Stygian bureaucracy, so ancient 
and entrenched that it’s impossible to root out. And with all 
the time in the world stretching ahead of them, there’s little 
incentive for established members of the Hierarchy to adapt, 
to change, or to respond quickly to requests or demands from 
everyday wraiths. Meanwhile, younger wraiths, trapped behind 
immortal  superiors,  seethe  and  stew  for  decades  or  more,  as 
their only hope for advancement is the utter destruction of a 
superior, by Shadow or by soulfire. Murderous intrigues spring 
up, the devious games of wraiths who have grown impatient 
over the centuries. All of these horrors are woven into the fabric 
of the Hierarchy, dragging it down from Charon’s pure initial 
conception into something painfully imperfect and monstrous. 
And yet, it is the last and best bulwark against Oblivion. 
It’s the Hierarchy that builds the walls high and keeps them 
manned, and it’s the Hierarchy that provides shelter and protec-
tion for the vast majority of Enfants reborn in Stygian territory. 
The  Byways  are  maintained  and  patrolled  under  Hierarchy 
authority,  and  Citadels  are  constructed  with  its  resources. 
And while the higher ranks of the bureaucracy are indubitably 
corrupt, the local Hierarchs are more often of the community 
and working to improve it, idealists and hardworking wraiths 
trying to do the best they can, helping new arrivals or keeping 
their fellow wraiths safe. Those few altruists who’ve risen in the 
bureaucracy see Stygia as a once-great empire that has begun 
to lose its way, and while it is undoubtedly flawed, its original 
intention was noble. In these degraded times, the best thing a 
wraith can do, they argue, is fight to uphold the original ideals 
on which the Hierarchy was founded, even if the Deathlords 
themselves have forgotten them. 
Ferrymen

The Ferrymen stand outside of Stygia, equal parts legend 
and mystery. Encounters with them are rare, while answers as 
to their true nature and history are even rarer.

What is commonly known is this: the Ferrymen travel along 
the Byways and through the Tempest on their own missions, 
frequently stopping to help wraiths in danger or in need. They 
also run the Midnight Express, providing safe transit through 
the Underworld. Students of Stygian history are aware Charon 
himself was once a Ferryman, and that the so-called Oath-Circle 
of the Oar predates Stygia itself. Eventually, its members grew 
disillusioned  with  Charon’s  increasing  self-aggrandizement 

and focus on building a safe haven in the Underworld, rather 
than helping wraiths on to Transcendence, and they ultimately 
split  with  him  after  the  First  Great  Maelstrom.  Since  then, 
they have been an ominous shadow lurking on the fringes of 
Stygian society, helping individual wraiths while at the same 
time maintaining an air of terrifying mystery.

The Ferrymen’s great secret is the rite known as the Sev-
erance, whereby the Ferryman’s Shadow is completely excised 
from her Corpus and instead exists as an independent, mon-
strous Spectre called a Pasiphae. Post-Severance, a Ferryman 
is immune to Catharsis (as well as the doubt that comes from 
having a Shadow constantly whisper in her ear). She also gains 
additional Corpus, new powers, and immense reservoirs of Pa-
thos and Angst to draw on as needed. The rite also makes the 
Ferryman look somehow stretched, and hinders her ability to 
cross the Shroud. However, accepting Severance — supposedly 
taught to the Ferrymen by Anubis, though the Ferrymen them-
selves will neither confirm nor deny this — means becoming 
a being of immense power, one who is matched by a cunning 
and  equally-powerful  adversary  bent  on  undoing  everything 
the Ferryman achieves. 

Every Ferryman carries three key pieces of equipment: the 
lantern, the scythe, and the hooded robe. The robe appears to 
be made of humble fabric, but it can endure Spectre claws and 
howling Maelstrom winds without a tear, while the hood always 
shadows the Ferryman’s face. The lantern’s light pierces even 
the darkest Tempest storm clouds, providing a beacon of hope 
to the lost and lighting the way for the determined. And the 
scythe is perhaps the deadliest weapon in the Underworld. In 
the hands of a trained user — and every Ferryman is trained 
in its use — it can wreak untold havoc or be used to make the 
most delicate of cuts. 

The Ferrymen are headquartered at the city of Dis, a lone 
island honeycombed with tunnels and crowned with fortresses 
deep within the Tempest. Surrounded by the hulks of sunken 
ships and dangerous reefs, Dis is nearly impossible to approach 
unless one knows the precise route — as all Ferrymen do. Others 
who try and fail find the waters near Dis to be home to particu-
larly inhospitable and aggressive plasmics, and the Ferrymen 
have been known to actively turn away unwanted visitors. As 
for the island itself, it contains the great halls, manufacturing 
concerns, and spartan dwelling places of the Ferrymen, who 
return here for councils, and for rest and recuperation. Most 
Ferrymen, even the ancient First, spend little time at Dis, pre-
ferring to prowl the Underworld on their neverending mission.
Ferryman society is largely flat, with each member treated 
as an equal from the moment he takes up the oar. Those surviv-
ing Ferrymen who predate the learning of the rite of Severance 
are referred to as “First,” and they make up many of the office 
holders  of  the  group.  But  the  choice  of  new  Ferrymen  is  so 
selective and the initiation so rigorous that all who become 
Ferrymen are deemed worthy of as much respect as any other. 
In the decades since the Fifth Great Maelstrom and Charon’s 
disappearance, the Ferrymen have been more aggressive about 

68

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

interfering with Stygian society. It was they who brought Stygia 
to the table to establish the Covenant of the Millions, and with 
Charon gone, their interactions with Stygia and those who hold 
the reins of its power have become more frequent than ever. 
The Midnight Express

The surest, safest route from the Shadowlands to the heart 
of the Underworld and back, the Midnight Express is a spectral 
train of indeterminate length that stops at dozens of Necropoli 
before plunging into the deeper Underworld. Chugging along 
on tracks that are miraculously inviolate even in the swirling 
heart of the Tempest, it features a mismatched hodgepodge of 
relic train cars — luxury carriages from the Orient Express, a 
Pullman car, a car from a circus train, etc. — all strung together 
in what appears to be random order. The length of the train 
varies — it is described as being “as long as it needs to be” — 
and those who truly need passage will always find there’s room 
in the car that’s pulled up to the station.

The Express is pulled by the legendary #13 Engine, and its 
engineer is a wraith named J.W. Stillwell. Stillwell was at the 
throttle of old #13 when she jumped the tracks in the Skinlands, 
and he’s been with her ever since. Watching over the train as 

a whole are the Ferrymen, who are often seen on board, and 
who have been known to defend the Midnight Express as it 
barreled through four-bell Maelstroms.

The  Express  is  always  on  time,  arriving  at  each  stop  at 
precisely midnight local time. Occasionally, this requires the 
train to be in multiple locations at once, and yet somehow it 
always works out. Standard stops include great Necropoli like 
New York, Atlanta, London, Rome, and more, as well as places 
that hold particular resonance for railroading folk and locations 
Ferrymen have deemed significant. It will sometimes stop at 
locations that previously never saw its visits, usually in response 
to some vague but looming crisis. “The train knows where she’s 
going,” is Stillwell’s only comment on such matters.

Travel on the Midnight Express is free, though luxuries 
can sometimes be purchased. Stillwell and his crew, led by the 
redoubtable Jonathan Jojanns, maintain a strict peace on board 
the train, and anyone who disturbs it is liable to be chucked 
overboard into the Tempest. As a result, the Midnight Express 
is considered a safe haven for travelers of all stripes, and one can 
find Hierarchs, Renegades, Ferrymen, and even the occasional 
self-possessed Spectre among the train’s passengers.

SETTING

69

Legions 

Just as the Roman Legions served as the backbone of both 
the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, the Legions of 
the Restless Dead form the necessary framework for Stygia’s 
ruling  Hierarchy.  Each  wraith  technically  belongs  to  one  of 
the eight Legions, assigned upon arrival to a particular Legion 
according to the wraith’s manner of death. Sometimes, when 
the way in which a wraith died is arguable, the Legions who 
might lay claim to the wraith may dispute which Legion has 
the better claim, and then the case is adjudicated by lawyers, 
combat, or whatever other method the opposing Legions see 
fit to use that day.

Each Legion falls under the control of a Deathlord who 
holds ultimate responsibility for the actions of her followers 
and troops. Authority passes down through a series of military 
ranks, similar to those of the Roman Legions. The Deathlords’ 
ultimate purpose is to guide the Legions in the performance 
of  their  duty  —  the  maintenance  of  the  Stygian  Empire  as 
the Underworld’s chief bastion against the forces of Oblivion. 
On the surface, this might seem a simple matter for a group 
of  powerful  individuals,  presumably  with  many  hundreds,  if 
not thousands, of years of experience in the Underworld. In 
reality, however, the Deathlords have, over time, fallen prey 
to the weaknesses so often found among similar groups in the 
Skinlands. As such, it is the title that endures, not necessarily 
the individual, and each Deathlord’s ornate mask of office not 
only represents power but also hides the changed face behind it.
As powerful as they are, the Deathlords are still driven by 
recognizable needs: power, recognition, or the desire to ascend 
the absent Charon’s throne. These competing ambitions can 
lead to conflicts between the Deathlords as surely as differences 
on policy might, and those rivalries trickle down through the 
ranks. The clashes can be so bitter that a member of the Emer-
ald Legion, upon finding herself the sole survivor of an attack 
by Spectres, may think long and hard about seeking refuge or 
assistance from members of another Legion, even though they 
may be nearer than her own reinforcements. Even when inter-
Legion relations are tolerant (as with the Emerald Legion and 
most others), the whisper of doubt (as well as the wraith’s own 
Shadow) creeps to the fore, warning the lone Legionnaire that 
there is always a first time for the betrayal of trust.

Despite these rivalries and lack of true cooperation, the 
Legions,  for  the  most  part,  perform  their  jobs  successfully. 
After all, Stygia still stands. One reason for this success lies in 
the ability of the Legions to absorb a civilian side as well as 
its natural military side. Each division has its own duties and 
does not usually conflict with the other. As hated as another 
Legion might be, Oblivion is first and always the true enemy.
Civilian Duties

Not every wraith serves as a combat soldier in her Legion. 
Most wraiths who are recruited into a Legion find themselves 
in  a  civilian  job  instead.  The  bureaucracy  of  Stygia  is  im-

mense, overshadowing that of the most red-taped, bound-in-
triplicate corporation in the Skinlands. The citizens of Stygia, 
its Necropoli, and its outposts spend most of their time sifting 
through the chaos of being the receptacle of untold numbers 
of souls every day. Each soul must undergo processing: reaping, 
assessment  of  its  value,  assignment  either  to  a  Legion  or  to 
the soulforges, transportation and initiation into the basics of 
Underworld existence, and that’s just the start.

Civilian members of Legions serve as census takers, main-
tain the stability of the various Necropoli in terms of physical 
condition, social structure, the training of Enfants, enforcing 
laws, instilling loyalty to their Legion, and more. The civilian 
membership  of  the  Legions  keeps  Stygia  running  smoothly 
(concealing  the  bumps  they  encounter  with  long-practiced 
techniques),  and,  at  its  best,  provides  a  safe  place  for  every 
new wraith to dwell in and come to terms with their afterlife.
Military Duties

The  work  of  the  military  arm  of  the  Legions  —  what 
most wraiths think of when they hear the word “Legionnaire” 
—  consists  of  patrolling  the  Byways,  keeping  order  within 
the Necropoli, hunting down Spectres, chasing Renegades or 
Heretics whenever they create problems, and other duties as-
sociated with a standing army. The Legions, however, perform 
an  even  more  important  duty.  By  their  very  existence,  the 
Legions create stability and order in a realm that is endlessly 
threatened by the hungry maw of Oblivion.

Legion Rank
In order to maintain parity with, and enable integration 
of, military and civilian roles in times of need, both groups 
use the same series of ranks to keep the chain of command 
firmly in place. Originally, each member of a Legion held a 
rank that corresponded to the equivalent one in the Roman 
Legions. As the centuries rolled by and Stygia evolved, new 
roles emerged, and so did new names for them. The ranks are:
Legionnaire — Legionnaires make up the basic rank and 
file of the Legions. They form the majority of patrols, bear the 
brunt of front line action, and, in general, perform the actions 
assigned to them by their superior officers, i.e., anyone other 
than themselves.

Centurion  —  As  empowered  representatives  of  Stygia, 
Centurions represent the most basic of officer classes (roughly 
equivalent to a Lieutenant in the U.S. Army). Individual Cen-
turions may use some leeway in their interpretations of the many 
laws and rules of Stygian life, whether in or out of combat. Just 
as a Legionnaire’s focus is on following orders, a Centurion’s goal 
is to achieve whatever mission is set before her by her superior 
officers.  Centurions  usually  aspire  to  higher  ranks  with  more 
privileges and responsibilities. In the meantime, they command 
between four and 20 wraiths, depending on circumstance.

Marshal — Stygian Marshals enjoy some independence 
and a great deal of responsibility, since they take charge of the 
small domains outside the larger Citadels. They control several 

70

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

patrols (and their corresponding Centurions) and answer directly 
to their Legion’s Overlord. They can be seen as Captains, by 
those more familiar with modern military ranks, but also carry 
some of the nuances of “Sheriff,” or Federal Marshal.

Regent — A Stygian Regent is an elevated Marshal, control-
ling areas further from local Citadels and requiring even more 
independence of thought and action than a Marshal. In areas 
not centered on a Necropolis, the Regent is often “the Law.” 
They are roughly equivalent to Majors in a modern military.

Overlord — An Overlord ranks just under an Anacreon, 
and is often thought of as second-in-command of her Legion 
in her city. In a large Citadel, an Anacreon may have more 
than  one  Overlord.  Overlords  act  as  direct  assistants  to  the 
Anacreon and oversee most of the day-to-day responsibilities 
pertaining to their Legion, making policy decisions, organizing 
patrols, and giving orders to lower ranking Legionnaires. An 
Anacreon’s Overlords may be considered equal to colonels and, 
when an Anacreon has more than one Overlord, they make 
up his command staff.

Anacreon — Anacreon lived in Greece during the sixth 
century  B.C.E.,  and  was  considered  one  of  the  nine  most 
important  lyric  poets  of  Greece.  Though  the  truth  remains 
unknown, many consider him to be the first in Stygia to hold 
the position later named after him. The Anacreon stands as 
the  most  powerful  member  of  a  Legion  within  a  Citadel.  A 
council made up of the Anacreons of every Legion except the 
Legion of Fate, which steadfastly remains outside politics, rules 
each Necropolis. Together this council makes decisions affect-
ing the Necropolis as a whole. Although they claim to strive 
for cooperation among the Legions, too often the Anacreons 
become embroiled in inter-Legion politics. Anacreons answer 
only to the Deathlords in Stygia proper, giving them tremendous 
authority in their own Citadel and its corresponding Necropolis.

The Emerald Legion

Composed of wraiths who met their deaths through hap-
penstance,  the  Emerald  Legion  contains  some  of  the  most 
positive-minded, forward-thinking elements of Stygian society. 
Perhaps the fact that members met their deaths, not after long 
and debilitating illnesses, but rather from sudden and uncon-
trollable interruptions in their lives has marked these Legion-
naires’  attitudes,  making  them  more  anxious  to  get  on  with 
their unlives rather than bemoan their bad luck. In addition 
to victims of car crashes, household accidents, fires, floods, and 
“acts of God,” the Emerald Legion counts among their number 
a significant number of mountain climbers (or fallers, as the 
case may be), base jumpers, skateboarders, and other extreme 
sports athletes. Those who court danger in life seldom fear it 
when they enter the Underworld. They may not have lived 
themselves, but their spirits live on. 

The Emerald Values
Sometime after the disappearance of Charon, so the story 
goes, the Emerald Lord himself delivered a series of four prin-

THE LEGIONS IN BRIEF
The Emerald Legion — Composed of the victims 
of happenstance, this Legion is ruled by the 
Emerald Lord, from the Seat of Thorns.

The Legion of Fate — Composed of those wraiths 
who bear fate’s mark, this Legion is ruled by 
the Ladies of Fate from the Seat of Fate.

The  Grim  Legion — Composed of those who 
died through violence, this Legion is ruled 
by the Smiling Lord from the Seat of Burn-
ing Waters.

The Iron Legion — Composed of those who died 
of old age, this Legion is ruled by the Ashen 
Lady from the Seat of Shadows.

The  Legion  of  Paupers  —  Composed  of  the 
victims of mystery, this Legion is ruled by the 
Beggar Lord from the Seat of Golden Tears.

The Penitent Legion — Composed of the victims 
of madness, this Legion is ruled by the Laugh-
ing Lady from the Seat of Succor.

The Silent Legion — Composed of the victims 
of despair, this Legion is ruled by the Quiet 
Lord from the Seat of Silence.

The Skeletal Legion — Composed of the victims 
of pestilence, this Legion (also known as the 
Gaunt Legion) is ruled by the Skeletal Lord 
from the Seat of Dust.

ciples he called The Emerald Values. These values serve as the 
bedrock of existence in the Emerald Legion.

Value One — Determine Risk
Rather than subscribing to the “cover your ass” practice 
of  most  of  the  other  Legions,  the  Emerald  Legion  encour-
ages taking reasonable risks in undertaking missions (for the 
military arm) or taking on projects (for the civilian arm). The 
emphasis  on  risk,  performance,  and  trial  instead  of  results 
creates an air of positivity among Emerald Legionnaires not 
found elsewhere. The oft-spoken phrase “we learn from our 
failures more than from our successes” proves inspirational in 
a realm where successes are few and far between, and in which 
most wraiths must content themselves with damage control 
and acceptable losses. These are counted as “near successes” 
among the Emerald Legion.

The Legion encourages the use of Fatalism to change odds 
to favor success, usually aiming for an 80/20 ratio as ideal. Le-
gionnaires often consult Oracles and other experts, or bargain 
with their Shadows, even if the long-term consequences are 

SETTING

71

not always desirable. The corollary to this Value is: Take risks, 
but stack your deck when you do.

Value Two — Cogs Turn Wheels 
The second Value puts a premium on the common wraith. 
Things get done by the people who do them, not by the ones 
who command the doing. Few Emerald wraiths get smelted, 
since each person behind a desk or at the battle lines is ac-
complishing more than a smelted item decorating a Legion-
naire’s quarters or filling his pockets. Better to be destroyed 
in the fight against Oblivion than to grace someone’s living 
or working space. This assurance likewise inspires a sense of 
security rare among other Legions.

Value Three — Throw It Up and See if It Flies 
The third Value encourages acting on one’s risk taking. 
Failure  is  more  acceptable  than  lack  of  trying  so  long  as  it 
leads to another attempt, informed by the previous failure. 
The theory holds that, if one winnows out all the risk factors, 
eventually something will work. The only sin is in not trying.

Value Four —Talk Emeralds, Not Thorns
The fourth Value enjoins Legionnaires to battle against 
their Shadows’ constant efforts to undermine productive ac-
tion. Although Legionnaires may find it hard to distinguish 
the  blame  game  from  constructive  criticism,  this  precept 
encourages  them  to  try.  Negative  criticisms  should  always 
come with a positive solution in the wings.

ABUSE OF THE VALUES: ASSESSOR STATES
When an Emerald Anacreon goes bad, an As-
sessor State is born. Commonly found in the Shad-
owlands of dictatorships or areas overwhelmed by 
bureaucracy, the Assessor States are pockets of 
Emerald Legion control where the Emerald Values 
are twisted into a cult of productivity, and those 
who don’t measure up are hauled before “Assessor 
Boards” to determine whether they deserve to be 
kept from the forges. Curiously, the Emerald Lord 
and his advisors do nothing about the prolifera-
tion of the Assessors, instead preferring to issue 
bland statements about “internal disagreements.” 
In the meantime, more and more Assessor States 
dot the map, and more and more Emerald wraiths 
are faced with the choice of falling in line with 
the Assessors or facing the fire. 

Civilian Life

Non-military  members  of  the  Emerald  Legion  tend  to 
view themselves as all-important “cogs” in the wheel of supply 
and demand that keeps Stygia going and Oblivion at bay. The 
Emerald Anacreons employ kindness and positive reinforce-
ment rather than fear and suspicion to make sure that workers 

72

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

keep their production levels high. Due to this, wraiths of the 
Emerald Legion are among the most productive and, for lack 
of a better word, happiest in Stygia.
Military Life

Because  the  idea  of  hundreds  of  independent-acting, 
forward-thinking soldiers does not necessarily translate well into 
military structure, the Emerald Values have not transitioned 
as well to military life. After centuries of struggle between the 
“Old Guard,” who held out for traditional military hierarchy 
and unquestioning obedience to orders, and younger wraiths 
who insisted on an “army of equals” facing Spectres and other 
enemies, each according to her own manner, one wraith stepped 
forward with a plan to solve the dilemma.

Vietnam veteran Marcus Lowry appeared on the scene in 
1972, having proven himself as a strong Legionnaire and, later, 
as a canny tactician and capable commander. He convinced the 
Old Guard to allow him to combine the Emerald Values, with 
their focus on individual action, with tried and true small unit 
tactics. He organized the Legion into small “Ranks” of around 10 
individuals each, with field-promoted “Occasional Centurions” 
(or OCs) commanding each Rank, while regular Centurions 
commanded 10 to 12 Ranks, making up Centuries that could 
work as one large unit or many smaller ones. In addition, he 
negotiated with other Legions, loaning them Emerald Ranks for 
special operations. These small groups excelled at such focused 
operations, winning them kudos among the Legions and gain-
ing Lowry many followers. While many of the Old Guard still 
hold to traditional tactics, Lowry’s Legions continue to gain in 
number and popularity.

Standard military dress in the Emerald Legions consists of 
long coats, trousers, knee-high boots and squared-off military 
caps, except for members of Lowry’s Legions. Each Rank adopts 
its own style of uniform, while remaining within the parameters 
of military dress.
Other Legions

The Emerald Legion holds a mildly tolerant view of the 
other Legions, recognizing the need for the different Legions 
but feeling their superiority over all the other, less enlightened 
armies of Stygia. Their strongest alliance exists with the Pau-
pers Legion, and Emerald Reapers often concede souls to the 
Beggar Lord without disagreement when necessary to maintain 
parity of numbers. They decry what they consider the waste of 
souls in the Grim and Gaunt Legions, who consign potential 
recruits to the forges that the Emerald Legion might consider 
as salvageable. They bear some resentment toward members 
of the Legion of Fate, however, due to that Legion’s failure to 
share information that might answer some of the many ques-
tions that plague victims of happenstance.

The Skeletal Legion

The Skeletal Legion lays claim to anyone killed by sick-
ness  or  pestilence.  Victims  of  cancer,  genetic  disorders,  or 

opportunistic secondary infections also find their place in the 
Skeletal Legion. 

In many cases, individuals who succumb to a disease have 
at least some time to prepare for their deaths, meaning more 
Skeletal Legionnaires had time to put their affairs in order be-
fore they crossed over. This results in less unfinished business 
on their part, which in turn translates to weaker Passions and 
Fetters than the average wraith.

This potential weakness — or strength — has not escaped 
the observation of the Skeletal Lord. Irreverently nicknamed 
“Mister Bonyhands,” he keeps a massive chronicle of his every 
spoken thought, entitled The Journals of Bone, which is lov-
ingly transcribed by the small army of scribes that follows him 
around. In addition, he issues frequent proclamations, declaring 
amendments to existing policies or creating new ones in such a 
flurry that not even his closest advisors can keep track. While 
there is debate as to what is actually intended with these actions, 
one thing is clear: The Skeletal Lord views himself as Charon’s 
right and proper heir, and every move he makes is intended to 
make the other Deathlords understand this as well.
Civilian Life

Non-military members of the Skeletal Legion, unsurpris-
ingly,  exist  within  a  highly  compartmentalized  society,  with 
many departments covering every aspect of work and “play.” 
The Skeletal Lord enjoys coming up with more and more ways 
to sort out his subjects, and frequently creates new departments 
to reflect his latest ideas, some of which are then immediately 
disbanded  or  merged  with  other  groups  as  new  inspiration 
strikes. A few of the more significant divisions, along with their 
duties, appear below.

The Department of External Affairs consists of the wraiths 
who represent the Skeletal armies to outside groups. From their 
lofty spot in the upper reaches of the Tower of Bone, the Legion’s 
ambassadors and their staffs represent the Legion, not only to 
the other Legions, but, clandestinely, to other groups as well 
— including Renegades, Heretics, and even other supernatural 
creatures. Here, attempts to coordinate actions with the other 
Legions are the focus of daily routine. 

The Department of Internal Affairs falls under the com-
mand of the Skeletal Legion’s Civil Services, though many of 
its senior officials come from the military. Select Marshals may 
become Inspector Generals for Internal Affairs. As such, these 
individuals (and their entourages) visit the various Necropoli 
to oversee the activities of both civilians and military. They 
have the onerous and often dangerous duty to seek out corrup-
tion in the ranks, whether from cheating in reports, embezzling 
oboli, hoarding supplies, or siphoning off Thralls slated for the 
soulforges. They provide preliminary investigations of charges 
of treason or disloyalty, determining whether to resolve matters 
locally or refer the charges up the line, even as far as Stygia. 
These Inspector Generals also concern themselves with morale 
within the ranks, interviewing many of the lower echelons as to 
their attitudes toward their leaders and to their fellows. On the 

SETTING

73

more tedious side, Inspector Generals have the responsibility of 
preparing statistical studies of the collection and distribution 
of Enfants, to make sure they miss no one with the potential 
of joining the Skeletal Legion. Their powers make Anacreons 
nervous  —  with  good  reason.  A  bad  word  whispered  back 
home  and  even  the  mightiest  Anacreon  might  find  herself 
fatally reorganized.

The Department of the Crimson Trefoil, otherwise known 
as Research and Development, studies and compiles information 
on mortal diseases. The Skeletal Lord has forbidden reaching 
across the Shroud to create new diseases, per requests from the 
Lady of Fate, but that still leaves plenty of work for R&D as they 
gather up every bit of information on every mortal pathogen and 
illness they can find. The goal is to develop an exhaustive body 
of information on diseases to help Legion members understand 
what killed them, knowledge often instrumental in resolving 
Fetters or Passions. The Crimson Trefoil supports itself, and 
makes extra money for the Legion, by charging curious wraiths 
of other Legions for their information. 

Legionnaires who do not hold government jobs fall under 
the  “General  Services”  classification.  This  sector  of  civilian 
life includes shopkeepers, street cleaners, entertainers, and the 
myriad other denizens of a city. Here, too, are the unemployed, 
the petty criminals, the hard-luck wraiths and those who have 
fallen through the cracks, at least until discovered and put to 
more “gainful use.”

Legion Constables straddle the line between military and 
civilian affairs. Technically part of the military, they have a 
mission to police the Legions — civilian and military — with 
the authority to call in the heavy troops when situations get 
out of hand. Like police detectives, they investigate criminal 
activities  reported  to  them.  The  wraith-on-the-street  both 
respects and fears the Skeletal Constabulary, and Constables 
work very hard to uphold their image as righteous protectors.
Military Life

While  most  of  the  Legions  emphasize  some  form  of 
structure in their military, the Skeletal Legion demonstrates 
military compartmentalization to the extreme. Some believe 
this stems from the Skeletal Lord’s fondness for rules, policies, 
and cataloging (leading some wraiths to speculate that the Lord 
was originally a librarian). Others claim that the nature of the 
members of the Legion requires more regimentation than other 
Legions. These were, after all, not natural fighters, for the most 
part, but instead those who fell victim to conditions they could 
not resist. The excessive do’s and don’ts of military service help 
these wraiths get a grip on their new existence and, in fact, gain 
some control over their fates. 

In the Skeletal Army, Centurions command squads of 10 
Legionnaires, whose duty consists of patrolling a single territory. 
Within Stygia, each Skeletal squad has the responsibility for 
one section of the city. Each squad, when not on patrol, shares 
a  bunkhaunt,  supervised  by  a  Marshal  within  a  Necropolis 
or a Regent, in places without a Necropolis nearby. This ar-

rangement  creates  a  bond  of  solidarity  among  Legionnaires, 
making the Skeletal Legions some of the most internally loyal 
of Stygian troops. 

The General Overlord commands the entire Skeletal Le-
gion from his personal headquarters in Stygia (or, in the case of 
important battles, from his field command post). The General 
Overlord’s identity remains unknown, though much speculation 
exists as rumors, which change from moment to moment. What 
is certain is that the General Overlord is a brilliant military 
tactician with many Skinlands battles to their credit as well as 
a long list of Underworld military victories to celebrate.

The Skeletal Legion emphasizes the use of the longbow, 
both as a means of marking their soldiers as unique and also of 
preserving the devastating attacks a rank of longbowmen rep-
resents in battle. Each squad has one or two dedicated bowmen, 
while each battalion contains one company of trained archers. 
The Skeletal Legion places great value on relic longbows and 
pays well for any that come through the Shroud. Reports of 
museum fires or the destruction of private collections of ancient 
weapons in the Skinlands draw relic collectors to the site, eager 
to claim any available relic weapons because they know that the 
Skeletal Legion will pay top obolus for anything they acquire.
Uniforms  of  the  Skeletal  Legions  generally  consist  of  a 
mixture of styles and eras, though the 19th century military 
uniforms of the U.S. Army enjoy great popularity when avail-
able. Helmets for the Skeletal Legions feature crown-like points, 
and serve as identifiers for the Legion.
Other Legions

The Skeletal Legion maintains generally good relations with 
the Legion of Paupers and actively cultivates better relations 
with the Emerald Legion, with standing orders to come to the 
aid of Emerald Legionnaires whenever possible. A subtle rivalry 
exists with both the Iron and Silent Legions, since those Legions 
most frequently argue over the dispositions of souls. The Grim 
Legion presents the most direct rivalry since the Smiling Lord 
and the Skeletal Lord control the two largest Legions, and each 
vies for supremacy against the other. Open warfare has not yet 
broken out due to the overriding necessity of combating the 
forces of Oblivion, but in the meantime, mutual espionage and 
light sabotage make up the primary form of hostilities between 
the  two  rivals.  The  Skeletal  Legion  tends  to  keep  a  distant 
politeness with the Penitent Legion, while the Legion of Fate 
evokes a general hands-off policy. They do, however, heed the 
words of the Lady of Fate whenever necessary.

The Legion of Paupers

Some wraiths awaken in the Shadowlands without hav-
ing the foggiest notion why or how they died. One moment, 
they  were  alive  and  well,  and  the  next  —  they  were  in  the 
Underworld. When a wraith appears in the Underworld with 
no clear deathmarks, or with too many, or with no idea of what 
happened to her, that wraith is inevitably claimed by the Legion 
of Paupers, victims of Mystery.

74

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Ruled by the eccentric, erratic and, some say, bitterly sar-
donic Beggar Lord, the Legion of Paupers remains one of the 
smallest Legions in the Stygian Empire. In addition to collecting 
wraiths whose deaths are shrouded in mystery, the Paupers also 
pick up many whose Legion membership is in question. Those 
who bear more than one deathmark or who can legitimately 
belong to more than one Legion fall into these ranks, particu-
larly when a squabble over their assignment would bring other 
Legions to blows.

Because of their small size and disparate membership, Pau-
pers often find themselves under the Stygian radar, underrated 
and unnoticed by most of the other Legions just as the other 
Deathlords overlook or dismiss the importance of the Beggar 
Lord. This practical anonymity allows the legions of the Beggar 
Lord to do what they do best: collect information unnoticed. 
The Paupers know what goes on across the entire Dark Kingdom 
of Iron, and beyond. They know where the figurative bodies 
are buried, and where the literal ones have crawled back out 
of the ground as Risen. This knowledge, in the possession of 
the Beggar Lord, places him in a pivotal position in Stygian 
politics. Too dangerous to destroy and too knowledgeable to 
ignore, he wields a subtle power that often has more sway than 
all the Smiling Lord’s bluster.
Civilian Life

Once  they  enter  the  Shadowlands,  Paupers  manage  to 
settle in to the daily grind with less trauma than many other 
Legions. Those with civilian jobs find a kind of tedious satisfac-
tion working for the Stygian bureaucracy. While shuffling and 
filing papers for wraiths who have just arrived, many discover 
a sense of continuity and completeness in the constant flow of 
backstories, most of which have a logical beginning, middle, 
and end, before crossing the Shroud. Likewise, many Paupers 
rise to the position of Reaper, seeing in their job a way to give 
newly arrived wraiths a place where they “belong.” 

Other Paupers serve the Legion on the streets of the Un-
derworld. They pursue offbeat occupations — buskers, street 
sweepers, and sometimes even literal beggars — while going 
about their true work of gathering information to bring back 
to their bosses. True talent evinces itself, and the Paupers with 
the juiciest tidbits of information or the hardest-won secrets 
rise within the hierarchy of information gatherers and spies. 
The best of the best graduate to positions in the Beggar Lord’s 
Stygian contingent, and their names become legend.
Military Life

Other Legions tend to look down on the Paupers, seeing 
them as a motley crowd of ne’er-do-wells who can’t even give 
a reason for being in Stygia. As a result, those serving the Le-
gion in a military capacity often feel they have something to 
prove. This need bestows exceptional determination, combined 
with a desire to defy expectations. Pauper Legions take pride 
in reminding others that some of the best fighters in history 
died shrouded in mystery. Lost flights, missing missions, whole 

LEGIONS WITHIN LEGIONS

Within the Legion of Paupers, a few special 
organizations exist, each one dedicated to a unique 
purpose that furthers the aims of the Beggar Lord.
The Legion of the Onyx Tear

The members of this sub-Legion constitute 
the personal guard of the Beggar Lord. Clad in 
distinctive  black  armor,  they  wear  onyx  masks 
with mouths carved in a perpetual laugh and tears 
descending from the eye slots. Limited in number 
to 25 Legionnaires of officer’s rank, these soldiers 
serve  in  five  units  of  five,  ensuring  a  constant 
bodyguard for their eccentric and always suspicious 
leader. Strict rules govern the routines of these 
elite Legionnaires. They may not gather in groups 
of more than six, ostensibly to make certain that 
a shortage of bodyguards never leaves the Beggar 
Lord  underprotected.  Most  wraiths  who  know 
about this restriction, however, believe it exists 
to  prevent  them  from  sharing  what  they  know 
of the Beggar Lord’s secret plans with each other. 
Since their duty is to the Beggar Lord, members 
of this Legion rarely leave the Isle of Sorrows on 
their own. At their Deathlord’s request, they visit 
the courts of the other Deathlords as the Beggar 
Lord’s agents. On the streets of Stygia, their word 
carries the weight of the Deathlord himself.
The Legion of Revelations

Officially,  this  sub-Legion  does  not  exist. 
No one except the Beggar Lord knows the exact 
numbers of this clandestine organization, and the 
members themselves only know the identities of 
their  immediate  associates.  This  Legion  bears 
the responsibility of interpreting the information 
gathered by the Legion’s spy network and furthering 
the covert operations of their master. Acting as the 
“hands” of the Onyx Tear, the Legion of Revela-
tions carries out their Lord’s wishes anywhere in the 
Underworld or beyond. Fiercely loyal, they would 
go to the forges before admitting their allegiance. 
These wraiths wear no special uniforms, as their 
anonymity serves as their disguise.

armies swallowed up by history — these are the inspirations the 
Pauper Legions look to in order to fuel their pride. 

Knowing  they’re  part  of  an  underdog  Legion,  Pauper 
Legionnaires fight knowing that the reputation of the entire 
Legion rests with them in every battle. As such, they exhibit a 
determination far beyond what could be reasonably expected, 
and they make a point of never giving ground. When others 

SETTING

75

turn and run, it is the Paupers who stand in the breach — and 
the few survivors are sure to let the other Legions know it.
Other Legions

The Paupers are well aware of their unique place in Stygian 
society. They serve as the important catchall for all those wraiths 
who have nowhere else to go, as well as the landing place for 
other Legions’ castaways. This puts them in good, if sometimes 
problematic, standing with everyone else — everybody needs 
them but nobody really wants them around. The Beggar Lord 
doesn’t help with this, as he makes certain everyone knows of 
his close working relationship with the Ladies of Fate. Since the 
Seat of Fate takes no direct part in Stygian politics, the Paupers 
serve as the Legion most often called upon as a “tiebreaker” in the 
event of a stalemate among Deathlords. No Legion wants them 
as opponents. The Grim Legion comes the closest to being an 
actual rival; both Legions exhibit the minimum amount of trust 
in the other to enable inter-Legion cooperation, when necessary. 

The Legion of Fate

Only two individuals stand at the heart of Stygia’s history: 
Charon, its founder and (despite his absence) supreme leader, 
and the Lady of Fate, who called Charon to serve as Stygia’s 
ruler and confirmed him in that role. Chosen to guard, protect 
and serve the Lady — or Ladies — of Fate, the members of the 
Legion of Fate enjoy the status of an elite army. The smallest 
and  least  homogeneous  of  the  Legions,  the  Fated  boast  the 
strongest and most stable organization of them all.

Those souls who bear the mark of Fate have little in common 
save one thing: Their deaths somehow mattered. Members of 
Fate’s Legion died for a reason, most often one known to them 
— and sometimes only by them. In life, many seemed to possess 
a preternatural knowledge of the time, place, and/or manner of 
their deaths. The Fated include the commercial pilot who lands 
his damaged plane so that he saves his passengers at the cost of 
his own life, the mother who tosses her child out of the way of a 
speeding vehicle only to find herself in its path, or the nuclear 
power plant worker who stays behind to seal a damaged core, 
preventing catastrophe at the cost of their own life.

Martyrs for their faiths, like Joan of Arc, or political mar-
tyrs, such as Lincoln, usually find prominent places among the 
Fated, unless they bypass the Underworld altogether. And a 
very few may not know why Fate chose them, arriving in the 
Shadowlands confused and bewildered; their reasons for being 
among the Fated only become apparent once they have joined 
the Restless Dead.

Unlike the Deathlords of the other Legions, the Lady of 
Fate, along with her council of Ladies, do not make their home 
in Stygia. Instead, they claim residence on the Isle of Eurydice, 
off the Stygian coast. Granted to the Lady by a grateful Charon 
in  return  for  her  counsel,  this  mysterious  island  affords  the 
Legion of Fate a certain independence from Stygian rule and 
sets them apart from most of the political machinations on the 
Isle of Sorrows.

STYGIAN STEEDS

Another  Stygian  mystery  revolves  around 
the steeds used by the Equitaes, or cavalry. Once 
upon a time, so the story goes, wild horses ran free 
along the banks of the Styx. Like the trees that 
once graced the river banks, the origin of these 
powerful horses lies cloaked in the mists of his-
tory. Some say they are living creatures endowed 
somehow with the ability to cross at will between 
the Shadowlands and the Skinlands. Others say 
they  are  the  spirits  of  great  horses,  brought  to 
the Underworld for some reason. The truth may 
never be known. 

The  horses  appeared  on  the  banks  at  ir-
regular intervals until the use of cavalry in the 
Skinlands stopped meaning mounted units and 
started  meaning  armored  vehicles.  With  a  few 
ceremonial exceptions, by the end of the 20th 
century,  mounted  cavalry  had  become  a  thing 
of the past, and the horses stopped appearing in 
the Shadowlands.

The  only  steeds  that  now  exist  do  so  as 
mounts  for  the  Equitaes  of  various  Legions. 
Though originally wild, once tamed, the steeds 
bond with one rider. They refuse to allow any-
one else to ride them until their original rider 
is destroyed. As trained warhorses, these steeds 
can  trample  any  would-be  interloper,  if  not 
bonded to them, into a Harrowing. These horses 
all have Argos •••••, making them capable 
of carrying their rider through the Tempest at 
incredible speeds.

They  wear  the  finest  armor,  equal  to  any 
belonging to elite Legion officers. When a Le-
gionnaire  must  decide  between  saving  a  horse 
or its rider, standing orders require him to save 
the horse. 

Most Stygian steeds are dark colored, rang-
ing from deep brown, through gray shades, to the 
blackest blacks. Occasionally, a bone-white horse 
appears. Usually reserved for Stygia’s elite, these 
pale horses, called “death steeds,” bond to only 
a single rider, ever. If their rider is destroyed, the 
horse simply fades into Oblivion. Some fear they 
continue to exist as mounts for Spectres.

Rumor  has  it  the  Lady  of  Fate  keeps  one 
of these white steeds, not as a mount, but as a 
bonded companion. No one knows whether she 
ever rides it.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

For  convenience’s  sake,  the  Legion  of  Fate  maintains  a 
“townhouse” in Stygia, though usually only minor officers take 
up brief residence there. Located on one of the few open spaces 
on the island, this building resembles a classic Roman villa. 
The estate itself presents an aura of serenity amid the bleak 
complexity of Stygia. Its landscaped grounds hold trees plucked 
from among those that grow along the banks of the River Styx. 
A thick, black stone wall surrounds the estate, and the whole 
houses  the  garrison  sent  as  the  Legion’s  contribution  to  the 
defense of Stygia. Here also reside the recent arrivals who await 
transport to the Isle of Eurydice for orientation and training.

Because of their unique physical position as part of Stygia 
while remaining outside the empire itself, the Lady of Fate and 
her Legionnaires maintain a sense of their own separateness. 
They do not fall into simple categories, as do members of other 
Legions. Their paucity in number also requires that members 
of the Legion of Fate take on numerous roles, whether they 
are members of the civilian branch or the military one.
Civilian Life 

Because of its small size, the Legion of Fate organizes its 
civilian branch efficiently. An Anacreon heads each Necropolis 
government or, in sparsely populated regions, an entire province. 
Below her stand the two non-military Chancellors of Reaping 
and of Politics and Administration, as well as the Overlord of 

Military Affairs. While the upper echelons of power mimic the 
structure of the other Legions, members of lower civilian ranks 
fall  under  a  less  rigid  system.  All  administrators  must  know 
how to perform many tasks to make up for the lack of numbers. 
Rather than performing the same tasks day after day, members 
of Fate’s civic government form ad hoc committees or specific 
task forces, which disband as soon as they achieve their goals. 
The regard that Fate’s Legions enjoy enables them to maintain 
a separate but cooperative internal government that takes care 
of its own rather than making use of the overall government 
of the Hierarchy.

Ministers and Inspectors form the bulk of “titled” positions. 
Lower ranks, such as Administrator or Clerk trainees, slowly 
work their way up to more prestigious titles. Fate’s civil servants 
undergo cross-training in many areas. Variety keeps the working 
environment fluid and challenging, preventing stagnation as 
the slow centuries roll by. 
Military Life

Greater in number than the civilian members of the Legion 
of Fate, the military branch has a reputation for excellence. 
Highly trained in small-unit tactics, the Fated Legions operating 
off the isle must cover more ground than most units of other 
Legions. Like the civilian bureaucracy, military Legionnaires are 
expected to be flexible, able to fill whatever role the situation 

SETTING

77

demands. Although their military performs actions similar to 
those of other Legions, the armies of Fate carry with them the 
assurance  that  whatever  they  do  is  what  they  are  “fated”  to 
do. Their presence inspires surrounding Legions with an extra 
dose of confidence.

Each Overlord of Military Affairs oversees military opera-
tions for his area. Sometimes they are the only units available 
to answer calls for help from the areas outside the Necropoli, 
performing duties and achieving a reputation for bravery far 
beyond  their  numbers.  Four  Legionnaires  and  a  Centurion 
make up a patrol (or section). Heavily armed with both firearms 
and swords made of Stygian steel, these units band together in 
groups of four to six to make up a cohort under the leadership 
of a Marshal. These cohorts, about the size of a platoon, make 
up  the  bulk  of  the  Legionnaires  used  in  patrols  or  deployed 
against Spectres. A company comprises a half-dozen cohorts, 
led by a Regent. All are expected to operate independently, 
and to use their best judgment rather than constantly looking 
to the isle for orders.

The Legion of Fate maintains three battalions, each made 
up of five companies, in the Tempest itself. Taking their orders 
directly from the Lady of Fate, they patrol the Byways and fight 
Spectres wherever they may emerge. Consisting of armored Eq-
uitaes and other crack troops, these heavily armed and armored 
warriors make up an elite force that has few rivals.

The companies rotate their duties so that no one remains 
too long in highly stressful postings. Many Legionnaires look 
forward to their turn among the five companies that make up 
the garrison on the Isle of Eurydice. Despite its isolated posi-
tion, the aura of peaceful silence provides weary Legionnaires 
with badly needed relief from the clamor and demands of duty 
in the provinces or the Tempest.
Other Legions 

The Legion of Fate tends toward indifference toward most of 
the other Legions, due to their sense of being set apart from the 
obvious politicking and policing of Stygia. They feel a kinship, 
however, with members of the Emerald Legion, since the line 
between Happenstance and Fate is a faint one. Members of the 
Iron and Grim Legions, however, seem to resent the Legion of 
Fate, considering them as unjustly favored by their position as 
the “darlings” of the Ladies of Fate.

The Penitent Legion

Madness makes strange bedfellows, and nowhere more so 
than in the Penitent Legion. Those who die because of madness, 
either their own or their killer’s, should end up in the Penitent 
ranks. This is not always as straightforward as it might seem. 
Reapers from other Legions often claim these wraiths; one who 
dies as the result of a spree killer’s rampage may end up in the 
Grim Legion while a depressed individual who hangs herself may 
find herself claimed by the Silent, and so on. Because of this, 
Penitent Reapers often take any wraith they feel may qualify, 
no questions asked, no paperwork done.

Members  of  the  Penitent  Legion  often  have  little  in 
common. Held together by the dicta of the Lady of Madness 
from her fortress, the Seat of Succor, members of the Penitent 
Legion  eventually  learn  to  coexist  with  one  another  and  to 
function as a Legion that can take its place within the power 
structure of Stygia. 

The Seat of Succor serves as a place of healing, in which 
wraiths  undergo  intense  therapy  to  learn  to  deal  with  their 
particular issues as needed. Sometimes this involves coexist-
ing with the individuals who caused their deaths; sometimes 
contemplation and meditation are called for. In a realm where 
pharmacology doesn’t exist and the soul manifests itself physi-
cally, approaches to mental illness swim in deep and uncharted 
waters. 
Civilian Life

Two groups figure most prominently among the civilian 
members of the Penitent Legion: the Reapers of the Penitent, 
and the Order of the Keepers. Reapers make up a wraith’s first 
“official” introduction to the realm of the dead, and the Penitent 
Reapers make every effort to find the Enfants who belong to 
them before other Legions’ Reapers snatch them up and perhaps 
do them irreparable harm. To prepare for this, Penitent Reap-
ers undergo special training and a grueling selection process 
to make sure that only the most decisive, quick-thinking, and 
fast-moving wraiths qualify for this delicate position. 

The Order of the Keepers serves as the personal compan-
ions, bodyguards, entourage, and aides to the Laughing Lady. 
Although they display a wide variety of talents and perform 
many functions, their primary duty consists of maintaining the 
mental health of the Legion’s members. Many Keepers came 
from  the  ranks  of  psychologists,  psychiatrists,  and  others  in 
the fields of mental health, while others show a demonstrated 
ability to deal with others wisely and with empathy. Clergy, 
social workers, and others who cared for those on the fringes 
of society now use their capacity for counseling and offering 
forgiveness to help their fellow Penitents. 

As Keepers, they use the Pardoners’ Arcanos Castigate to 
help scour the souls of their charges. Counseling sessions, both 
one on one and in groups, as well as incentives to model new 
behaviors,  also  serve  as  ways  to  help  Penitents  master  their 
problems. Regardless of their pasts, Keepers serve as the watchful 
eyes of the Lady as well as her helping (or punishing) hands. 
Most Keepers have a keen familiarity with the Seat of Succor, 
since they often convey Penitent wraiths to and from that hall.
Other civilian Penitents occupy places within wraith soci-
ety similar to their counterparts in other Legions. Though the 
Penitent Legion keeps fewer records than most other Legions, 
they do need clerks and “office” workers to process wraiths once 
they enter the Legion’s ranks.
Military Life

The military side of the Penitent Legion consists of several 
units whose identity and structure complement one another, 

78

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

ensuring a complex and effective fighting arm in the Shadow-
lands’ continual war.

The Skirmisher Corps, also known as the Storm of Night, 
claims the status of the oldest unit in the Penitent army. The 
Storm serves as the first line of battle, making initial contact with 
and attempting to stop the forward drive of the enemy. Clad in 
lightweight, jet-black armor and armed with bows and arrows, 
light swords, and bucklers, the Storm presents a formidable ap-
pearance. Excelling in hit-and-run tactics and trained in Argos 
to provide for quick and timely exits, the Skirmishers disrupt 
the initial attack formations, attempting to cause the enemy to 
fragment. When they have accomplished their mission, they 
pull back to allow the bulk of the Penitent Legion to engage.
The Phalanx Corps, otherwise known as the Wall of Skulls, 
provides the heft to the Penitent Legion’s attack. Forming an 
impenetrable phalanx, the Wall serves as a second wave, pil-
ing shock onto an enemy already discomfited by the lightning 
attacks of the Storm. They know only one direction in battle: 
forward. While specialized units move into action, the Wall 
acts  as  a  relentless,  inescapable  tide.  Clad  in  heavy  armor 
enhanced by bony ridges and carrying bone shields, they use 
heavy weaponry, either great swords or more modern weapons 
as the individual soldier prefers. A band of musicians made up 
of drummers and trumpet players provides a steady beat, set-
ting the pace for the advance. Colorful banners depicting past 
victories build morale among the Penitent, and the warriors of 
the Legion will gladly go down into a Harrowing before they’ll 
let one of their banners be taken.

A wraith named Liamh has served as the commander of 
the military arm of the Penitent Legion since his arrival in the 
Shadowlands during the time of Julius Caesar. A leader from 
Albion who attempted to stand against the Roman invasion, 
Liamh claimed that the voices of his gods spoke to him every 
night and helped him plan upcoming battles against the invad-
ers. Warning him of the impending arrival of Caesar’s legions 
and instructing him in strategy and tactics, these inner voices 
prepared  him  for  his  destiny.  In  actuality,  the  “gods”  Liamh 
heard instead prepared him for the real battle that would take 
place after his death, one against the overwhelming forces of 
Oblivion. After overcoming his resentment at working with a 
“Roman” institution, Liamh has worked to maintain an effec-
tive army, using his insights to create the soldiers of the Flesh, 
Beast, and Machine Corps to battle Oblivion.

The Beast Corps consists of groups of six: one beastmaster 
and five specially Moliated barghests, whose skins bristle with 
razor-sharp blades. The beastmaster’s armor encases him in a 
hard, insect-like carapace, while a helmet resembling a hound’s 
head with bared teeth completes the fearful image. The barghests 
are trained to display absolute obedience, and wreak utter havoc 
on an enemy when allowed to slip their leashes.

The Flesh Corps consists of horrific creations composed 
of  many  wraiths  Moliated  into  giant  Leviathans,  sometimes 
“ridden” by archers, spearmen, or snipers inside specially de-

signed howdahs. The monstrosities tackle weak points in the 
enemy’s lines, causing further disruption and often resulting in 
a wholesale, frantic retreat. Penitents who repeatedly fail efforts 
at rehabilitation or conflict resolution, or those who run afoul 
of the Laughing Lady, frequently end up as components of a 
Leviathan. Some wraiths attribute the disappearance of dissident 
wraiths from other Legions as well as captured Heretics and 
Renegades as fodder for these horrific creations. A few wraiths 
claim they spotted the discernable face of one of the missing 
within a Leviathan’s Corpus.

The Machine Corps makes use of Soulforging techniques 
to create hollowed-out war machines, somewhat like early 20th 
century tanks, filled with soulfire crystals. The machines have 
one job: to explode, sending a final, spectacular burst of terror 
into what is left of the enemy. Also composed of failed Penitents, 
whose screams increase the horror factor, these Juggernauts use 
only the most skilled, most aggressive drivers to direct them. 
The drivers undergo frequent rotation and receive intensive ses-
sions with the Legion’s Pardoners to avoid any risk of Catharsis 
before taking the wheel of one of their war machines; it would 
be unpleasant in the extreme for one to get turned around and 
used against its makers.

The final special group answers not to Liamh, but to the 
Laughing Lady herself. Made up exclusively of female soldiers, 
the Storm Maidens originally come from the Storm of Night. 
At  the  behest  of  the  Laughing  Lady,  these  fearless  women 
Helldive into the Tempest on rescue missions and also launch 
preemptive strikes on hives of Spectres. 

ON PENITENCE

The  external  perception  of  the  Penitent 
Legion is that every single Legionnaire is in some 
way insane. This is not the case. While the Legion 
may cannily project that image to cause rivals to 
underestimate the Laughing Lady and her follow-
ers, the truth is that relatively few of those in the 
ranks suffer from severe mental illness. Rather, 
the vast majority were taken out by a single mo-
ment of perversely bad judgement — the sudden, 
uncontrollable  urge  to  swerve  into  oncoming 
traffic, the irresistible need to get a selfie with a 
bear cub, or the foolish attempt to race heroically 
across a battlefield toward an enemy trench filled 
with manned machine-gun emplacements. Many 
of the Legion’s older members were seers, mystics, 
and religious ecstatics, and “madness” is a term 
hung  on  the  Legion  by  disapproving  outsiders 
in the 18th century. By allowing the myth to be 
perpetuated, the Laughing Lady carefully crafts 
the narrative that will cause thoughtless others 
to underestimate her followers. And, when the 
time comes, they will be ready. 

SETTING

79

Other Legions

The Penitent Legion has few friends among the other Le-
gions. The Silent, Grim, and Iron Legions, in particular, consider 
them rivals for their excellence in combat and frequently engage 
in jockeying for position, at least in the eyes of the Penitent. 
On the other hand, the Paupers, the Emerald Legion, and the 
Legion of Fate enjoy friendly and usually cooperative relations 
with the Penitents. This association seems to come about due to 
the eccentric nature of all these Legions. The Skeletal Legion 
holds itself apart, as they usually do, from any conflict.

The Iron Legion

Those who don’t die of anything else inevitably die from 
old age. The Iron Legion lays claim to all those victims of too 
many years — and a few others besides. Disputes between the 
Iron Legion and other Legions occur when a person’s cause of 
death directly relates to old age: an octogenarian falls prey to a 
life-ending accident, an elderly woman starves to death because 
she is too weak to eat, or pneumonia takes the life of an old 
man in his nineties. The Ashen Lady also claims the junkies 
who may have only lived a few decades but whose bodies bear 
the burdens of those much, much older.

The Ashen Lady is a shrewd bargainer, however, and knows 
when to pick her battles and when not to press for individuals 
who do not quite fit her mold. After all, she does not lack for 
recruits. When the other Legions have claimed their marked 
ones, the Lady gets everyone who remains behind, and they 
are legion.

The Ashen Lady rules her Legion from her opulent Seat of 
Shadows, rebuilt to exemplify the glory of the Renaissance and 
a leading “tourist” attraction for wraiths visiting Stygia. New 
wraiths come there with their Reapers for a brief period, during 
which they learn everything necessary for survival among the 
ranks of the Iron Legion. Some may stay on, or return later, if 
they qualify for any of the groups in residence within the Seat. 
Others depart, the image forever seared in their memories as 
an idea of what Stygia should be.

The Lady’s personal bodyguard, her Council of Ministers 
and  their  entourages,  and  members  of  the  Lady’s  prestigious 
“Salon” number among the permanent residents of the Seat 
of  Shadows.  A  permanent  support  staff  also  exists  to  main-
tain the art gallery, private library, and cutting-edge research 
laboratories. Because she rules over wraiths who come to her 
at the end of long and often busy lives, the Ashen Lady has 
access to a great reservoir of experience in many fields: Gener-
als, financiers, architects, lawyers, scientists, mob bosses, and 
dynastic patriarchs and matriarchs all contribute to the affairs 
of the Iron Legion and its Mistress.

The Legion encourages new recruits to take time off to 
track down deceased relatives, realizing that people who have 
lived long lives may have several generations of kin who have 
predeceased them. Enabling a Legionnaire to reconnect with 

her loved ones in Stygia or the Shadowlands not only helps 
build  cross-Legion  relations  but  frees  the  Legionnaire  from 
worrying about her family’s fates. Also, so many elderly wraiths 
have strong ties to their kin in the Skinlands; wraiths whose 
mortal lives encompassed many generations of sons, daughters, 
grandchildren  and  beyond  often  have  living  descendants  as 
Fetters. Understanding the particular strength of these ties, the 
Lady of Shadows allows her Legionnaires to bend the Dictum 
Mortuum just enough to visit their mortal kin, reaffirming their 
connections  and,  incidentally,  forging  potentially  valuable 
links that can prove advantageous to the Legion and its Lady. 
Ironically, the Iron Legion shows a surprising ruthlessness to-
ward members of other Legions caught Skinriding or otherwise 
making forbidden contact with the Skinlands.
Civilian Life

Meticulous planning forms the hallmark of both civilian 
and military existence. Surprises have a zero tolerance rating. 
“Expect anything” is the Legion’s motto. The years of experience 
represented by Iron Legionnaires ensure the highest degree of 
excellence in performance.

While many civil Legionnaires end up in the paperwork 
brigade or the street sweeper squadron, talent and years of mortal 
experience tend to assert themselves. The most prominent paths 
for civilians in the Iron Legion lead to the Salon, the MPPU 
(Maelstrom Prediction and Preparation Unit), the Mediators, 
or the Advocates.

The  Salon:  Emulating  the  prominent  cultural  salons  of 
the  17th  and  18th  centuries,  the  Ashen  Lady  has  collected 
the most brilliant minds and the greatest talents from within 
her Legion to form a think tank/social forum within her Seat 
of Shadows. Afforded the greatest luxuries Stygia can produce, 
these great artists, writers, musicians, philosophers, scientists, 
and other renowned persons exist in an eternal meet-and-greet 
intended to inform and amuse the Lady and any special guests 
she may have. Not all members of the Salon bear the natural 
Deathmarks of the Iron Legion; some come to the Salon as the 
result  of  inter-Legion  bargaining.  Once  part  of  the  Salon,  a 
wraith tends to remain permanently within the Seat of Shadows. 
Speculation about the fates of those who fall out of the Lady’s 
favor bears a grim cast, as no one ever hears a word about those 
who ceased to amuse. 

Many cutting-edge ideas come from the Salon, particularly 
among the scientific contingent, said to be working on cures for 
cancer and other diseases in order to bring more wraiths into 
the Iron Legion’s purview.

Maelstrom Prediction and Preparation Unit (MPPU): 
The wraiths in this group (originally part of the Salon) study 
Maelstrom  phenomena:  what  a  Maelstrom  is,  under  what 
conditions they form, and most importantly, how to stop them. 
Members of the MPPU design emergency procedures for enduring 
Maelstroms, creating training programs that every Legionnaire 
must pass in order to qualify for active service. The MPPU also 

80

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

designs fortifications against Maelstroms and ways to strengthen 
buildings in Stygia and the Necropoli to withstand the buffets 
of these spirit storms.

Mediators: Though the Dictum Mortuum strictly forbids 
contact with the Skinlands, the wraiths who make up the Me-
diators do just that. They act as liaisons between the worlds of 
skin and shadow, subject entirely to the orders of the Ashen 
Lady and her Ministers. The Mediators pass messages across the 
Shroud at the behest of their supervisors, remaining ignorant 
of the reasons for these messages. For excellent service, these 
wraiths  often  receive  permission  to  undertake  personal  mis-
sions across the Shroud. Sometimes the Lady amuses herself 
by allowing them to use mediums or charlatans to pass bogus 
messages to gullible mortals.

Advocates: The Iron Legion uses the lawyers and judges 
that come to them to form a corps of Advocates. Whenever 
one of their Legionnaires faces trial, either within the Legion, 
by another Legion, or by the highest authorities in Stygia, the 
Legion  provides  the  defendant  with  an  Advocate  to  ensure 
fair representation. Often, the Legion lends their Advocates to 
other Legions, setting a valuable precedent for equitable trials 
throughout Stygia and the Necropoli. Though other Legions 
have their own judges and lawyers, the Iron Legion counts more 
legal personnel among their ranks, possibly because so many 
members of the legal profession die of old age.
Military Life

For an army made up of “old soldiers,” the military forces of 
the Iron Legion maintain one of the most efficient and forward-
thinking militaries of all the Legions. The wealth of expertise 
available from so many time periods allows for excellence in 
training of new recruits, honing each member into a soldier 
capable  of  independent  thought,  yet  willing  to  practice  the 
restraint and discipline learned from their veteran instructors.
The army of Iron comprises two distinct units. The Regu-
lars, made up of veteran ground forces, practice tried-and-true 
military tactics and strategies, taking their examples not only 
from  the  armies  of  ancient  Greece  and  the  Roman  Empire, 
but also spanning the history of warfare up to the present day. 
They form the bulk of the Legion’s military and have bases all 
throughout Stygia. They call themselves the Elder Legions.

The Specials, on the other hand, make up a smaller percent-
age of the Iron armies, but make their presence known. These 
crack teams of soldiers, many of them drawn from various armies’ 
Special Forces throughout history, take on the most dangerous 
assignments the Legion has to offer. In exchange, they receive 
the latest weapons and devices that come from the research 
laboratories of the Salon and the MPPU, acting as beta testers 
in the constant war to stave off Oblivion. While some Specials 
look on their roles as guinea pigs with some trepidation, they 
would never admit it to anyone outside the Legion. They pride 
themselves as being the oldest and the best.

Other Legions

The Iron Legion maintains fairly amicable relations with 
most of the other Legions. The Ashen Lady and the Beggar 
Lord, however, enjoy an especially close and cooperative liaison, 
and their armies sometimes undertake joint ventures. While 
not  overtly  hostile  to  the  Skeletal  Legion,  the  Iron  Legion 
often competes directly with them for recruits, since many old 
people die from diseases.

The Grim Legion 

The Grim Legion claims all those who die by violence. 
Despite  the  common  assumption,  soldiers  do  not  make  up 
most of this Legion’s membership. Instead, most of the Grim 
are unwilling participants in the violence that took their lives 
— victims of mob or gang warfare, assassination, hate crimes, 
feuds,  and  suchlike.  Since  murderers  themselves  often  die 
violently, both murderer and victim may both end up in the 
Grim Legion, which means there’s the very real possibility of 
a murder victim serving in ranks with his killer.

Soldiers who die in battle do make up a significant portion 
of the Grim. Membership in the Legion takes no notice of the 
sides one took in the Skinlands, so often former enemies find 
themselves expected to fight together. Sometimes, however, the 
feuds of the living can’t be abandoned, and a situation similar 
to that of murderer and murder victim arises.

Over the centuries, the Legion developed its own way of 
dealing with this dilemma. Whenever a murder victim finds 
her way to the Grim Legion, she receives a promise from the 
Smiling  Lord.  If  the  new  recruit’s  killer  is  reborn  into  the 
Shadowlands, the victim will get a chance to see her murderer 
brought to trial, or at least to have a face-to-face encounter 
with that individual. 

It’s not an empty promise. Hundreds of Legionnaires work 
tirelessly to bring murderers back to the Smiling Lord’s domain, 
regardless of whether they were just reaped or are well-respected 
members of another Legion. During the ensuing trial, the truth 
of what happened inevitably comes out. A guilty verdict usually 
results  in  a  sentence  of  soulforging,  while  lesser  convictions 
range  from  imprisonment  to  immobilization  through  Molia-
tion to being assigned to suicide missions on the Smiling Lord’s 
behalf. Rarely, victim and murderer find a resolution that allows 
both parties a second chance, usually in separate Legions or in 
locations distant from one another.

The Legion tends to look the other way when one of their 
own  violates  the  Dictum  Mortuum  in  order  to  discover  the 
identity or location of their murderer, or uses Arcanoi to harass 
that person in the Skinlands. The saying “all is fair in love and 
war” takes on an interesting extension among the ranks of the 
Grim. “All is fair in love and war — and murder.” Members 
of the Legion stand together on this issue, and their solidarity 
makes them one of the tightest fighting units in Stygia.

Civilian Life 

Wraiths in the civilian arm of the Legion undertake their 
share  of  the  usual  and  necessary  jobs  found  throughout  the 
Shadowlands. Some special duties stand out among the Grim, 
however, and many of the wraiths selected by the Smiling Lord’s 
Reapers seem uniquely suited to these tasks.

Infiltrators:  Because  the  Grim  place  such  an  emphasis 
on  finding  out  the  causes  and  perpetrators  of  the  deaths  of 
its members, certain wraiths become Infiltrators. These indi-
viduals (once called Requiters) act like private investigators 
or undercover policemen. They work to develop leads in the 
murder investigations of fellow Legionnaires in their casefiles. 
Once they have a suspect, Infiltrators attempt to gain her trust. 
They serve as a confidant while they gather information that 
can either establish guilt, innocence, or, sometimes, exigent 
circumstances. These highly trained wraiths enjoy a great degree 

THE GREAT LEDGER

Centuries ago, a Grim wraith named Hiram 
decided to write down his death story for posterity. 
When the Smiling Lord heard of this, he com-
missioned Hiram to do the same for him. From 
these two stories emerged the massive tome that 
bears the title The Great Ledger.

With  the  Smiling  Lord’s  approval,  Hiram 
went  on  to  record  the  death  stories  of  other 
wraiths, chronicling as much as they knew of their 
passing. When Hiram indicated that the stories 
entered in the Great Ledger should also record the 
names, where possible, of the murderers of those 
who  told  their  stories,  the  Smiling  Lord  made 
participation mandatory. He appointed Hiram as 
the Master Scribe. To keep up with the massive 
number of wraiths needing to record their stories, 
Hiram  required  assistants.  His  helpers  became 
the first Scribes.

The  Ledger  itself  resides  permanently  in 
the Great Library. Because it requires continual 
updating, its pages allow for the insertion of new 
pages between older ones. Each story has its own 
pages, so that one wraith’s story never shares a 
page with another’s. Once a scribe inserts a story 
into the Great Ledger, it becomes permanently 
bound into the book. The tome itself rests upon 
a pedestal in the central hall of the Great Library. 
Its cover consists of the crafted soulstuff of some 
of  Stygia’s  oldest  murderers.  The  pages  come 
from the stock made on the Isle of Eurydice by 
the papiers of the Legion of Fate.

of leeway. They have the skills to maintain their covers, and they 
also act, in some circumstances, as judge, jury, and executioner. 
Infiltrators must have already solved or otherwise resolved 
their own need for personal vengeance before launching their 
own  careers.  In  fact,  doing  so  qualifies  them  for  their  job. 
Sometimes, when the stress of living undercover and bearing 
the responsibility of bringing another wraith to postmortem 
justice becomes too much, Infiltrators take on secondary careers 
performing unskilled or mindless labor until ready to return to 
their primary task. Regular visits to Legion Pardoners make up 
an even larger part of an Infiltrator’s schedule than they do for 
most wraiths.

Reapers: Grim Reapers, unlike those of other Legions, have 
the added responsibility of Reaping, if possible, the murderers 
of those they reap. Occasionally, this leads to problems with 
other Legions’ Reapers, who may have a valid claim on the 
murderer in question’s soul. If actual skirmishes break out that 
pose a threat to the peace, the local Anacreon of the Legion 
to  which  the  murderer  belongs  often  solves  the  problem  by 
delivering  the  discorporated  remains  of  the  murderer  to  the 
Grim  Legion  as  an  acceptable  compromise.  Murder  has  few 
proponents even in Stygia.

Retrievers: When the Infiltrators fail, the Retrievers get 
called in. Working either solo or in small strike teams, these 
master infiltrators will either bring back or take out their target 
by whatever means are necessary. They also make a point, after 
the fact, of publishing the facts of their cases. When possible, 
they use Stygia’s laws to accomplish their purpose, employing the 
full gamut of the Hierarchy’s legal system to their advantage. But 
when those systems fail, they fall back on their special training.
Sardonicai:  These  wraiths  belong  to  the  Smiling  Lord’s 
civilian Marshals and form an elite group within that category. 
They and their entourages act as ambassadors, not only to other 
Necropoli, but to the various Dark Kingdoms. They have the 
unenviable task of representing the Smiling Lord outside Stygia, 
bringing with them valuable or beautiful treasures or Artifacts 
as gifts to earn the favorable attention of distant realms of the 
Restless. Sardonicai have usually dwelt in the Shadowlands for 
many years — or centuries — and have received decorations 
and honors that testify to their diplomatic skills. Some of them 
transfer from prestigious positions in the military arm of the 
Legion to take up this new, even more perilous calling.

Scribes of the Great Ledger: While every member of the 
Grim Legion must, at some point in his existence, add his story to 
the pages of the Great Ledger, only a select few become Scribes. 
The job of a Scribe consists of overseeing the creation of accurate 
entries in the Great Ledger, whether through overseeing the 
writing of an individual or transcribing the entrant’s story. In 
addition, Scribes make additional notes to each story in their 
section, recording the resolution of an individual’s murder and 
the  details  regarding  the  justice  carried  out.  They  also  note 
discrepancies and make recommendations as to how to pursue 
resolving them. Many Scribes have skills as Pardoners. Potential

Military Life

The plethora of former soldiers who occupy the ranks of the 
Grim Legion’s military arm ensures its excellence in battle. Blending 
wraiths from many different eras might seem to lead to confusion 
in the ranks as conflicting battle styles clash. But the Legion has 
had centuries to work on integrating the latest tactics — and tacti-
cians — and instead the mixture leads to a synthesis of the best 
tactics from all the different armies. Specialized units who worked 
together in the Skinlands also have a place in the ranks of the Grim: 
Roman battalions or LRRP squads from the Vietnam era manage to 
stay together, particularly in instances where an entire squad dies 
simultaneously. These make up elite fighting units who go where 
their type of warfare makes the most sense, using Nihils as their 
means of instant transport.

Legion  soldiers  from  many  different  time  periods  also  train 
together before they separate into their special units so that any 
combination  of  soldiers  can  fight  together  based  on  a  common 
knowledge of fighting standards. That means training in everything 
from Macedonian phalanx warfare to modern MOUT tactics. It’s a 
lot, but the Restless have nothing if not time.

Regardless of their period of origin, Grim soldiers wear heavy 
gray clothing under armor resembling that of the Roman legions. 
Their helmets mimic human skulls. Only marks of rank distinguish 
individuals from one another; adding personal touches to one’s kit 
is strictly forbidden. This uniformity not only instills psychological 
fear in an opponent faced with an army of skulls, but it also helps 
unite the troops into a single, focused fighting unit.

Grim armies practice strict discipline on the field, knowing that 
precisely timed movements in battles that involve appearing and 
disappearing Nihils, the potential for Maelstroms, or any number of 
other phenomena unique to the Underworld can make the difference 
between success and destruction. The propensity of these soldiers 
for violence also demands soldiers who can control their impulses 
and channel them in the direction of their enemies. 

The Executioners: These wraiths make up the best of the best 
among the Grim Legion, comprising the Smiling Lord’s personal 
guard.  Each  has  personally  sworn  an  oath  to  the  Smiling  Lord, 
committing her Corpus, soul, Shadow, and existence to his will. On 
the rare occasions that the Smiling Lord leaves his Seat of Burning 
Waters, at least 50 Executioners accompany him at all times.

Dressed in identical black armor and capes, wearing helmets 
depicting a smiling skull as the faceplate, the Executioners maintain 
an eerie silence at all times when on duty. They only speak to give 
or acknowledge orders. In combat, their use of Keening often puts 
an enemy to rout before they even make contact. Some say their 
silent discipline carries over into their off-duty time, but only the 
Executioners themselves know — and they’re not telling.
Other Legions

The Grim Legion regards members of the Emerald, Skeletal, 
Iron,  and  Paupers  Legions  as  worthy  allies.  They  look  down,  in 

SETTING

general, on the Penitent and Silent Legions, feeling that they 
have no honor: the Penitents for not recognizing it, and the 
Silent for throwing their lives away. They respect the Legion 
of Fate, but prefer to ignore its members as much as possible, 
Grim Legionnaires believe they make their own fates, and no 
one can tell them otherwise.

The Silent Legion

“The Silent Legion,” proclaims the ancient jest the Quiet 
long ago appropriated for their own use, “is the empire’s only 
all-volunteer Legion.” It is black comedy whose core of truth 
makes it all the more cutting, for among the victims of despair, 
death was all too often a conscious choice. Yet the Silent Legion’s 
ranks are a perpetual source of surprise for wraiths who expect 
a morose collection of suicides whose final living acts failed 
to end their tormented existences. Here, too, are the terminal 
cancer patients who chose death with dignity, surrounded by 
loved ones, the self-effacing nonentities who led lives of quiet 
desperation until they simply stopped living, the troops encircled 
or left as sacrificial rear-guard detachments, whose only option 
was to reenact Thermopylae, the forgotten martyrs whose faith 
availed them nothing against counter-revolutionary fervor or 
authority’s cold indifference, the school shooters whose revenge-
power fantasies crumbled at the first resistance from intended 
victims, and the silent millions whose final living regret was 
that they had made no difference in the world. Despair wears 
many  faces.  Not  all  of  them  are  blue-lipped  from  poison  or 
smeared by a shotgun blast under the jaw.

The first few weeks after death and Reaping are critical for 
the  new  Quiet.  Whatever  measure  of  peace  or  freedom  they 
hoped to find postmortem, the Underworld isn’t it. Left to her 
own devices, almost every Silent Enfant attempts suicide again, 
hoping to finish the job this time. Some do a better job of it 
than others — for every wraith who frantically scrabbles to slit 
wrists that don’t bleed, another swan dives into a Nihil and never 
comes out. Fortunately, centuries of practice have made the Si-
lent Legion adept at the combination of counseling, mentoring, 
discreet Arcanos application, and direct intervention necessary to 
arrest suicidal recidivism before another one of its new members 
volunteers again — this time for Oblivion. Most Quiet Reapers 
operate in loose Circles to ensure a variety of approaches are 
available to match each recruit’s temperament. If a freshly Reaped 
wraith truly isn’t capable of dealing with the Underworld, Quiet 
Reapers suggest Steel Martyrdom: voluntary soulforging as a last-
ditch escape from despair that doesn’t feed Oblivion.

As with any other cause of death, not every suicide victim 
(or victim of despair) becomes a wraith. Only those with strong 
drives or social connections — usually unvoiced, denied, or even 
suppressed beneath the level of conscious acknowledgement 
— cling to life after death. Silent Reapers ruthlessly exploit 
these Passions and Fetters to demonstrate to their charges that 
wraithly existence can bring a fresh start.

This  approach’s  perennial  danger  is  that  it  encourages 
violations of the Dictum Mortuum. The ensuing conflicts drive 

THE SUCK

Younger Restless who are still coming to terms 
with wraithly existence often conflate Oblivion, 
their Shadows, and their personal depressions and 
sources of despair. In attempting to externalize 
these forces, wraiths personify them. Names as-
signed to these darknesses typically attempt to 
diminish their influence through mockery: the 
Suck, the Cloud, the Big D, Harvey, Daddy Is-
sues. Shadows are notably unappreciative of such 
appellations. 

Older Quiet with a better understanding of 
Underworld metaphysics still identify despair as 
a  separate  force,  much  like  fate  (though  mak-
ing this comparison in earshot of fate’s own can 
draw… interesting… comments). The common 
interpretation holds that despair is integral to the 
Psyche, separate from the Shadow’s manifestation 
of Oblivion. The Quiet Lord discourages explora-
tion of the connections between the two forces, as 
such inquiries frequently lead to heresy or Spectral 
conversions. Nevertheless, some of the Legion’s 
greatest heroes have been those who claimed to 
have mastered or transcended despair.

the Silent Legion’s most vicious internal disputes. As an Impe-
rial organ, the Legion is bound to uphold Charon’s laws, yet its 
recruit retention methods stretch the bounds of legality. Those 
Quiet  whose  formative  interactions  paid  off  are  among  the 
most liberal of Hierarchs, while those whose early experiments 
brought only more regrets become sorrowful but unforgiving 
enforcers. Legion history records no Quiet Lord taking a side 
in this eternal debate.
Civilian Life

Recognizing  that  regimentation  and  monotony  often 
fostered  despair  in  their  charges’  living  days,  Quiet  leaders 
strive to keep their Legion’s bureaucracy to a minimum. Some 
degree  of  organization  is  necessary,  even  in  the  Hierarchy’s 
second-smallest Legion, but positions in the back office go to 
wraiths who actually crave sameness in their daily existences. 
The bulk of Silent Legionnaires find themselves in more active 
roles, often tasked with just a hair more work than they can 
comfortably manage. Ostensibly, this is a consequence of the 
Legion’s constant understaffing. Really, it’s another deliberate 
personnel decision, one intended to keep the Quiet too busy 
to backslide into introspection and regret. The typical Restless 
figures this out within the first century of unlife, after which 
their duties coincidentally become less onerous — if she’s also 
becoming less prone to despair.

84

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Every Silver Lining Has a Dark Cloud

The Quiet’s biggest collective problem is that their cause 
of  death  persists  after  death.  The  biochemical  processes  of 
depression may go away with the mortal shell but the deeper-
seated and more insidious psychological causes remain. Even 
sanctioned Arcanoi have limited impact. A Pardoner can only 
do  so  much  if  the  seed  of  Oblivion  lies  within  the  patient’s 
Psyche, not her Shadow.

Some Quiet characterize their organization as “the Under-
world’s biggest support group,” another common meme from 
the Legion’s self-deprecating gallows humor. In life, many were 
trapped in vicious cycles of alienation and withdrawal, under-
stood by no one (or so they felt). Quiet Regents and Marshals 
spend a lot of time on personnel management, identifying their 
charges’ particular strains of despair and assigning tasks that 
bring them into contact with like-minded fellows. In theory, 
this fosters empathy and a sense of belonging. When the theory 
works, it’s great.

When accepted methods fail, the Quiet all too frequently 
turn  to  unaccepted  ones.  In  particular,  two  banned  Guilds 
have longstanding associations with despair’s victims. Those 
Restless who seek surcease from their self-destructive impulses 
turn to the Solicitors to suppress these desires. For those who 
would  rather  forget  the  events  that  spawned  their  personal 
darkness, the Mnemoi have always been there. Guildwraiths 
of both organizations sought refuge within the Silent Legion 
after Charon outlawed them. Their continued presence is the 
Quiet’s most closely-held secret.

What To Do
A key element of the Quiet Lord’s stewardship is a Legion-
wide focus on finding a craft or art matching each of his subjects’ 
Passions.  Consequently,  the  Silent  Legion  dabbles  in  every 
legitimate Stygian pursuit without cornering the market on any 
of them. There’s a subtle pressure toward production-oriented 
or creative pursuits, the better (so the conventional wisdom 
says) to stave off despair. Quiet who take up soulforging often 
prefer artistry over practical assembly-line work, especially when 

SETTING

85

working with Steel Martyrs. In entertainment fields, Quiet tend 
to enjoy notable successes in one of two modes: channeling 
their  personal  demons  into  wrenching  tragedies  or  meeting 
them head on with wicked satire.

If the Silent Legion can be said to produce Stygia’s best at 
anything, those would be its counselors. The Quiet cultivate 
unflinching self-awareness. Restless with a gift for empathy find 
themselves  guided  toward  advanced  training  in  both  mortal 
psychology and the particular needs of the dead. Their Arcanoi 
lessons focus on Castigate, with Lifeweb also common. Particu-
larly competent and trusted Quiet may receive offers of tutelage 
in Intimation or Mnemosynis. Even without these latter arts, 
the status that the rest of the empire grants the Silent Legion’s 
Pardoners and Monitors gives them access to the secrets of a 
surprising breadth and depth of Stygian society.
Military Life

Early Quiet Lords recognized that their Legion would never 
be able to match its larger counterparts in size or wealth, and 
established policies of quality over quantity that remain in place 
today. The Silent Legion’s military arm is proportionally smaller 
than those of most other Legions and chronically under-equipped 
but its officers compensate by sparing no expense for training. 
In particular, the Silent Legion has always sought out combat 
veterans who succumbed to despair, attempting to rehabilitate 
them as cadre for its unseasoned troops.

Another factor compounds the Legion’s troop shortage: 
Its military arm accepts only Quiet who aren’t despair-ridden 
and looking to commit suicide by Spectre. Blazes of glory and 
heroic last stands are fine for Chanteurs to sing about, but in 
the real Underworld, the Silent Legion can’t afford the waste. 
Part of every soldier’s job is to die for the cause if necessary, but 
that isn’t a virtue here.

As a result of these policies, the Silent Legion fields some 
of the Underworld’s finest light infantry. Scouts, skirmishers, 
snipers, and raiders, their job isn’t to stand in firing lines or 
phalanxes, but to harass and disrupt enemy operations and return 
with intelligence. Backing up this capability is a surprisingly 
robust transportation arm that provides both logistical support 
and battlefield mobility. Death comes on silent wings — whether 
that’s Argos or parachutes.

The Ten Thousand
This elite battalion of Equitaes is the core of any Silent 
Legion  expeditionary  force.  Despite  its  name  and  historical 
precedent, it rarely numbers more than a few hundred wraiths. 
Soldiers who died in foreign lands with no hope of returning 
home make up the Ten Thousand’s ranks. Not all are victims 
of despair, but enough bear its deathmarks to align the unit 
decisively with the Quiet. The unit does cause the Quiet Lord 
occasional headaches, though. If evidence came to light of its 
independent raids into other Dark Kingdoms to rescue Stygian 
prisoners of war, the empire could find itself drawn into open 
conflict without warning.

The Rushes of Lethe
The Rushes of Lethe is a small group of Silent Legion 
veterans who have transcended despair. Or perhaps they’ve 
found a way to use it as a weapon — maybe as a new Arcanos, 
or  somehow  forged  into  their  legendary  Severance  Blades. 
Whatever the case, they’re the Quiet Lord’s personal body-
guards and hatchetmen, anonymous behind their featureless, 
midnight-blue  masks.  They’re  certainly  dangerous  enough 
but their present duties are largely ceremonial, a comfortable 
reward for long service in the ranks. Certainly, they’ve never 
conducted covert operations on behalf of despair’s victims, 
especially  not  against  other  Legions.  And  it’s  ridiculous 
to  think  that  the  Quiet  Lord’s  most  trusted  troops  include 
martially-adept Solicitors or Mnemoi….
Other Legions

The Silent Legion has cordial, yet distant relations with 
most of the other Legions. It’s mainly a question of focus — the 
Silent are either turned inward toward introspection, or outward 
toward the boundaries of Stygia, and the in-between politics 
are rarely of interest. The one exception is the Grim Legion, 
which too many Silent view as being made up of bullies and 
abusers, precisely the sorts of people who engendered despair 
in them back in their breathing days. 

The Guilds

he Guilds of Stygia are each one part trade 
cartel,  one  part  secret  cabal.  Formed  in 
the  earliest  days  of  Stygian  society,  they 
coalesced  around  the  development  and 
perfection  of  specific  Arcanoi.  Guild 
members  are  the  undisputed  masters  of 
their respective arts and the gatekeepers of 
advanced study. Though the Hierarchy relies on their knowledge, 
it has always been wary of the Guilds’ ambition. Their suspicion 
is not unjustified: The Guilds attempted a coup centuries ago, 
and  the  threat  of  a  reprise  always  lurks  in  the  background. 
But  time  heals  some  wounds,  and  while  the  Guilds  are  still 
officially illegal, they’ve quietly — in most cases — crept back 
into Stygia and set up shop. After all, everyone needs what 
they have to offer. 
The Collegia

Occult orders and secret societies have always attracted 
the Restless. Oracular mystery cults older than recorded history 
thrived among the Mediterranean cultures that fed into early 
Stygia. Souls crossed the Shroud expecting to find answers to 
the metaphysical questions they pursued in life. To the dismay 
of many early wraiths (and the delight of a few), the Underworld 
was if anything more confounding than the Skinlands. Those 
for whom arcane study was a concern often redoubled their ef-
forts when confronted with an afterlife rife with mysteries and 

86

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

dangers. By the time of Rome’s ascendancy, cults and cabals in 
Stygia were common as cobblestones. 

One popular form, carried over by early Roman dead, was 
the collegium. In the Skinlands, collegia served a broad array of 
purposes. Many were nothing more than organized crime syndi-
cates. Some served as social clubs, others as trade cartels. Most 
were a little of all of the above, in the way a modern country 
club is a great place to do some insider trading between rounds 
of golf. And within them, they carried the seeds of what would 
become the great Guilds of Stygia.
Origins

Every Guild has their own story of how they came to be, 
and no two agree with one another or the official Stygian his-
tory. It is entirely possible that the Stygian records are incorrect, 
and that the true beginnings of the Guilds are hidden behind 
a smokescreen of “official Stygian action.” It is also entirely 
possible that the Guilds have self-mythologized to downplay 
the empire’s role in their creation, allowing them to distance 
themselves from their seemingly mundane roots. In either case, 
it’s best to know all the stories, and who believes which one, 
before doing business with a Guild.

While collegia participation was merely a social outlet for 
many wraiths, some were serious students of the secrets of the 
afterlife. They gathered in earnest to try to understand the new 
possibilities and jealously guarded their discoveries. Out of their 
studies arose the earliest formal, repeatable manifestations of 

the powers recognized today as Arcanoi. The Stygian Republic 
tolerated these early efforts as long as the concern of such cults 
was what came next: Transcendence. In some cases, such as the 
burgeoning Nhudri cult, a network of chapters based on shared 
rites  and  philosophies  seemingly  always  existed  to  advance 
the use and teaching of certain techniques. Likewise, Mnemoi 
organized and oversaw the judiciary of the Republic of Stygia 
from its earliest days. Before their banishment they served as 
judges, with the Usurers acting as early court recorders. Most 
powers, however, were as yet unexplored or only understood 
in a rudimentary fashion. 
Like Attracts Like

The  cabals  of  Stygia,  such  as  the  collegia,  were  at  first 
unrelated or had at best passing contact. As groups began to 
make discoveries, the more successful Circles drew the interest 
of Stygia’s most dedicated researchers and vice versa. Circles 
sought the greatest minds of the dead as new recruits to help 
them in their studies, competing for membership even as wraiths 
began to show predilections toward manifesting one set of pow-
ers or another. They also brushed against one another when in 
pursuit of the same secrets.

When  more  than  one  collegia  or  cult  sought  the  same 
ends, things often got ugly. Consolidation — whether through 
peaceful mergers or less genteel means — became common be-
tween collegia studying similar powers or competing for talent. 
Monopolies formed around these techniques, with practitioners 

SETTING

87

setting increasingly outrageous prices for their unique services. 
Over time, the formalized Arcanoi arose from their ambitious 
exploitation of new abilities and the wraiths who mastered them.
While this led to a rapid expansion of powers available 
to the dead, it worried the republic. Stygia did not appreciate 
authority  —  especially  authority  shored  up  by  secrecy  and 
occasional brawls — being wielded by any other than those 
it controlled. Rumors were common, within and without the 
collegia, that the Legions would be deployed at any moment to 
shut down the societies and to seize their secrets. 

Instead, the authorities played the collegia against one an-
other to the Legions’ advantage. Consolidation was encouraged 
to eliminate troublemakers, put down political ambitions, or 
create distractions. There are Usurers — and Mnemoi — whose 
records  reflect  a  long  pattern  of  Stygian  interference  in  the 
development of the Arcanoi. Powers the authorities deemed 
too worrisome were quietly discouraged or altogether eliminated 
— as were the wraiths developing them. A collegium dedicated 
to something patently illegal might be wiped out by “unknown 
rivals” while another merely suffered the silent disappearance 
of its brightest minds. The secrecy of these groups regarding 
their own research and results prevents us from knowing exactly 
what was lost. It is widely believed within the modern Guilds, 
however, that techniques far stranger and more powerful than 
the  current  Arcanoi  were  wiped  out  amidst  the  Republic’s 
manipulations of the proto-Guilds. 
The First Great Maelstrom

The First Great Maelstrom proved to be the ending and 
the saving of the collegia in Stygia. After the vast destruction 
wrought by the storm and the things that rode into Stygia with 
it, Arcanoi were sought after. Repairs were needed. Replacement 
Artifacts had to be forged. Routes between Necropoli had to 
be  restored  and  the  wounded  needed  healing.  Legionnaires, 
concerned invasion would be the new norm, quietly sought out 
applications of Moliate to improve their odds in combat. The 
infant empire simply could not recover without skills exclusive 
to cults, the secrecy of which they loathed to legitimize. In the 
end, they had no choice. If Stygia were to be rebuilt in fast 
fashion, arcane techniques would be required. 

The  empire  already  relied  on  the  Nhudri  cultists  who 
developed Inhabit, and some other developing orders. Stygia 
hoped for equally beneficial symbiotic relationships with other 
groups and a better understanding of these groups’ capabilities 
— if only it could get them under the empire’s thumb. The 
solution was to give the cults something to lose by not submit-
ting to authority. The Hierarchy offered the collegia a source of 
guaranteed income via litterae patentes: a legal monopoly on 
the powers they developed. 

All arts would be recognized, but only one charter would be 
offered for each power and the power must be explained. The 
Hierarchy hoped to inject just enough mistrust into the proto-
Guilds to weaken their grip on the abilities they controlled. The 
long period of secrecy and mistrust between rival organizations 

had taken its toll in grudges between metaphysically minded 
Restless. Rather than join forces with long-hated competitors, 
Imperials reasoned, some Arcanists would be absorbed into the 
Hierarchy. Legions would gain access to their abilities and the 
empire would be strengthened. Instead, the offer sparked off a war. 
The War of the Guilds

The  study  and  use  of  Arcanoi  had  become  extremely 
profitable,  and  profit  makes  a  powerful  motive  for  violence. 
Now,  with  a  shot  at  enforceable  monopolies,  the  candidate 
Guilds turned on one another with previously unseen savagery. 
Countless wraiths gifted in arcane arts were sent to Oblivion or 
eaten by their own Shadows as they scrambled for the promised 
letters of patent from the empire. No one was entirely clean by 
the end of this shadowy war of assassinations and street battles. 
Cults  kitted  out  their  best  thugs  as  living  weapons  and 
hunted rivals to extinction in the cobblestone alleys behind 
Stygia’s decaying facades. Leaders were ambushed and forcibly 
disappeared. Safe havens and magical laboratories were ferreted 
out and obliterated. Other occult enterprises built around pow-
ers in violation of the Dictum Mortuum — Embody, Puppetry, 
Outrage, or Pandemonium — moved against one another in 
the relative obscurity of the Skinlands. There they could find 
plenty of blood-soaked Pathos and mortals only too ready to be 
turned to violent ends. Living victims executed heinous acts 
against one another, from individual assaults to wars between 
nations, until these proxy conflicts were spent. Even those with 
powers not particularly suited to violence joined the conflict. 
Every esoteric order and metaphysical entrepreneur stood to 
live or die on whether they won Stygian recognition. 

By the middle of the 14th century, the proto-Guilds had 
eliminated so many only a few remained. In 1358, the Artifi-
cers and Usurers jointly presented a charter to these survivors, 
creating the Council of Guilds. Their intention was to regulate 
trade and punish violence between competitors. Participation 
was mandatory for recognition, and the creation of Arcanos-
based business ventures was otherwise prohibited. (There were 
grumblings the Ferrymen should be forced to join, but no one 
seriously considered trying to force the Ferrymen to do anything.) 
Gathering support took time but by 1405, the Guilds held 
legal  monopolies  on  all  Arcanoi,  including  their  teaching 
and  practice.  Sharing  knowledge  of  them  outside  a  Guild-
sanctioned arrangement was strictly forbidden. The formalized 
were instantly wealthy beyond imagining. Oboli poured in like 
a river, with its headwaters in the forges of the Artificers and 
its deltas in the pockets of all the rest. The Oracles warned of 
a dark future, but no one listened. 

Not everyone benefited, however. The empire needed to 
make sure the Guilds knew to submit when commanded. Acting 
on rumors the Solicitors were considering a coup, the empire 
did not hesitate to crush the Guild. The Legions tore Solicitor 
Guildhalls to the ground and their leaders — those who were 
caught — were sent screaming into Artificer forges. The mes-
sage to the Guilds was clear: They were to be entrepreneurs, 

88

not politicians. The Guilds were to know their place in society 
and to stay in it. A surplus of ambition would be punished by 
eternal anguish.

The Council persisted for two and a half centuries, dur-
ing  which  time  the  Guilds  and  their  membership  amassed 
vast wealth. The powers manifested in the Arcanoi were vital 
to the continuation of Stygia’s economy. Perhaps less overtly 
acknowledged,  they  were  also  vital  to  Stygian  psychology. 
Many wraiths have nothing but time. Guilds offered the Rest-
less opportunities for entertainment, for income, and for ways 
to occupy themselves. The intense scarcity of resources in the 
Underworld is mirrored by the widespread dearth of purpose 
many Restless feel. Driven by their Passions, every wraith has 
cares and fears, all of which are deeply personal. Like the collegia 
and other societies before them, the young Guilds were a way 
to build something together.
The Coup

The Guilds suffered the same surplus of ambition that brings 
down many Skinlands enterprises. Many businesses measure 
success  only  in  growth,  and  this  eventually  pushes  them  to 
overreach, sometimes with disastrous consequences. With their 
monopolies locked in and their income maximized, the Guilds 
looked for new applications of their effort. Stygian society at 
its heart was — and is — a machine designed to convert politi-
cal will into oboli and back again. Commerce and power are 
the two main pastimes available to the dead. With more coin 
than they could count, the Guilds turned their passion toward 
building and buying political influence.

Pioneering this aspiration was a small faction of Artificers 
whose arts were discouraged by the traditional power structure 
of the Nhudri cult. These wraiths had developed Flux instead 
of studying the traditional applications of Inhabit. Expecting 
praise for their achievement, they were instead openly shunned 
by their more traditional masters. Students of Flux were given 
the pejorative “Alchemists” in mocking reference to hucksters 
and grifters of the Quick. Under the noses of their leadership, 
the Alchemists went into business for themselves. Relegated 
within their Guild to the arcane equivalent of doing the sweep-
ing up, Alchemists started selling their services out of the back 
doors of Artificer Guildhalls far and wide. Flux quickly brought 
the Alchemists wealth of their own. With that coin and the 
demand for their services, the Alchemists began to curry favor 
within  and  without  the  Guild.  Wraiths  who  wanted  Fetters 
strengthened or destroyed and relics manipulated would gladly 
grease Alchemist palms out of sight of the more conservative 
Nhudri cultists.

The  Mnemoi,  playing  their  own  game,  were  seen  to 
encourage the Guilds’ yearning for political power. Hierarchs 
who accused them of corruption had long thrown them out of 
the courts the Mnemoi themselves had constructed. Nursing 
grudges for centuries, they felt the moment for their revenge 
was  long  overdue.  Whispering  in  the  Alchemists’  ears,  the 
Mnemoi painted elaborate pictures of a future in which the 

Alchemists were an independent Guild. Alchemists could be 
peers — no, betters — of the Artificers who held them back. 
They simply needed some grand, ambitious effort they could 
lead. The Alchemists in turn pulled strings from outside the 
Guilds to foment a rebellion.

In 1598, the Alchemists and those they — and the hidden 
Mnemoi — influenced were ready to make their move. Eager 
to see an end to the Dictum Mortuum, the Freewraiths of the 
Haunters, the Spooks, the Puppeteers, and the Proctors were 
quick to support the effort. Widely respected and relied upon, 
the Artificers’ more temporally ambitious members joined the 
coup.  Pardoners  contributed  to  the  effort  only  because  they 
knew  Oblivion  would  claim  too  many  for  Stygia  to  survive 
if Castigate were not available to whoever came out on top. 

Usurers joined only halfheartedly, knowing the coup would 
mean chaos but fearing resistance would mean being made scape-
goats as the Solicitors had been. The Masquers likewise put forth 
at best a token effort, concerned with the effect success might have 
on the brisk business they did with the Legions — not to mention 
their trade with Renegades, Heretics, and anyone else who might 
shy away from them if the Guild had too much official power. 
Chanteurs were hesitant to join and in the end hired themselves 
out to the other Guilds at absurdly high rates. Keening might be 
used to influence other wraiths or shatter Legion weapons, but 
at great cost. Sandmen had always been focused on their powers 
and not politics, not caring whether the coup succeeded or failed. 
Harbingers took plenty of contracts to transport conspirators, but 
they also transported the Legions who responded. 

Early  on,  as  they  made  preparations  for  the  rebellion, 
the Alchemists consulted the Oracles. Their response is not 
recorded, but they were not invited to participate and did not 
volunteer. Alchemists have harbored some degree of hatred of 
the Oracles ever since.

The Guilds moved swiftly and applied the most fearsome 
powers available to them. The coup looked for a short time 
like  it  would  succeed.  Proctors  and  Puppeteers  were  incred-
ibly effective agents. They used the Skinlands for both covert 
channels of communication and the distribution of materiel. 
Haunters sowed chaos to cover the others’ tracks. Mercenary 
Chanteurs fanned flames of discontent and shattered Legion 
fortifications.  Existence  in  Stygia  is  brutal  and  terrifying  for 
many,  and  widespread  discontent  was  readily  turned  to  the 
Guilds’ ends. The empire’s grip was not as tight as it might have 
hoped in all Necropoli and outposts. There were places where 
the Legionnaires could be intimidated into taking orders from 
new masters. Others were so far flung they never knew the coup 
was happening. Some officers could simply be bought, and the 
Guilds commanded more than enough wealth to do so.

These early successes were short lived. Usurers and Masquers 
shook the coalition by abandoning it almost as soon as the coup 
began. When the Alchemists declared themselves a new and 
independent Guild, the traditionalist elements of the Artificers 
reasserted themselves: The Nhudri cult’s practice of Inhabit was 
sacred and the practice of Flux was a sacrilege. The Artificers 

SETTING

89

quickly  surrendered  to  the  empire  and  offered  the  Alchemists’ 
leadership as the real authors of the rebellion. Only Usurers cared 
deeply enough about getting the history right to raise objections. 
Fulfilling the Usurers’ worst fears, their conflicting accounts drove 
the Hierarchy to count them among the most dedicated rebels. The 
empire’s reliance on what the soulforgers offered was so complete 
the Artificers could successfully execute libel against some of their 
own members and, in so doing, bring down a Guild that was, at best, 
hesitant to participate. 

With the three most economically important Guilds now out of 
the coalition, and the Pardoners at best neutral observers trying to 
keep everyone sane in the chaos, it was over. By the middle of the 
year, the empire had snapped back into the expected order. Imperial 
authority was never seriously threatened. The Guilds had achieved only 
their own destruction. Charon issued a decree called The Breaking, 
banning the Guilds, revoking their litterae patentes, and ordering the 
Legions to seize their assets. Too late, the Guilds realized they simply 
brought to fruition everything they feared. The empire gained vast 
wealth, the leaders of the Guilds were soulforged into silence, and 
much knowledge of the ancient arts was forever lost. 

In  some  Legion  halls,  to  this  very  day,  there  are  reclaimed 
trophies crafted from the corpora of rebellion leaders. They scream 
faintly, as if heard from a great distance, whenever a Guild wraith 
calls  out  to  them.  Some  Freewraiths  honor  them,  others  dismiss 
them as reminders of someone else’s mistakes, but everyone knows 
the Artificers did the forging.
Life on the Fringe

After the Guilds had their charters revoked, membership became a 
crime. It was possible to be hunted and soulforged for belonging to any 
of them. This didn’t change the fact that many wraiths had few or no 
other options when it came to the services that only the Guilds could 
offer. The empire still required the services of several of them in order 
to function. The Stygian economy relied thoroughly on the Artificers. 
The military needed Masquers to improve their soldiers. The judiciary 
needed Usurers to record decisions and provide evidence in disputes. 
All wraiths needed the services of Pardoners or they would quickly 
be overwhelmed by their Shadows. The empire made it clear to the 
alumni of these former Guilds that they were free to practice their arts 
as before, but organization of a political nature would not be tolerated. 
They were half ordered and half begged to return to their forges, their 
blades, and their books, and to keep their heads down.

Some were simply ignored as long as they remained apolitical. 
Chanteurs whose voices crumbled Legionnaire fortifications were 
certainly  smelted  alongside  the  Harbinger  captains  who  ferried 
them  free  of  charge,  but  everyone  needed  trade  and  entertain-
ment. Before long, the “softer” Guilds — Chanteurs, Harbingers, 
and Sandmen — were left alone so long as they didn’t make their 
Guilds’ persistence obvious. 

The  empire  focused  instead  on  the  real  targets  of  its  fury: 
the  Alchemists  and  the  Guilds  so  eager  to  overturn  the  Dictum 
Mortuum. Those orders were hunted relentlessly, with the Legions 
enthusiastically  destroying  nearly  everyone  they  could  find  who 
knew the powers of Puppetry, Embody, Pandemonium, or Flux. They 

90

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

of course kept around a few from whom they could learn those 
powers for their own use, while others simply slipped through 
the cracks, each hunted Guildwraith helping the next — when 
they weren’t selling one another out in exchange for safe pas-
sage through Legion lines. 

The quiet existence of Guilds whose powers were focused 
on  the  Shadowlands  was  considered  a  necessary  evil.  Some 
Hierarchs devotedly hunted after them, with proof of Guild 
affiliation leading to immediate destruction. More commonly, 
Guild-affiliated wraiths were tolerated as long as they kept their 
mouths shut and their heads down. This was especially true in 
locales with fewer experts on whom to draw. Not every com-
munity of Restless could afford to follow the letter of Stygian 
law. Someone had to mint coins, advance culture, and keep the 
Shadow at bay. Even so, Guilds were held in wide disregard. 
An accusation of Guild membership was the easy shortcut to 
disposing of an enemy, akin to the Skinlands practice of accus-
ing a widow as a witch to drive her away; accusations of Guild 
membership were used as a blunt club in Stygian politics for 
centuries.  Many  wraiths  genuinely  feared  the  Guilds’  return 
and many Freewraiths feared being identified with the Guilds 
to which they swore fealty.

Usurers in particular bore the brunt of distrust out of those 
whose powers were integral to the function of Stygian society. As 
the fair-minded scribes of all transactions, they were seen to have 
violated a significant trust by their halfhearted participation in the 
conspiracy. Their early desertion did not counter this resentment. 
They have forever remained suspect in the eyes of the Hierarchy. 
Once among the best of Stygia, they are now its most distrusted.
After  the  Breaking,  Charon  approached  the  Oracles  to 
question  their  involvement  in  the  coup.  As  occurred  with 
the Alchemists, whatever was said between Charon and the 
Oracles is not recorded, but no Oracles were put to the forge. 
Their  Guildhalls  were  not  raided  and  their  wealth  was  not 
seized. Instead, they were quietly hidden behind new facades. 
Why, none would say.
The Guilds in Modern Stygia

Officially,  the  Guilds  are  still  outlawed  within  Stygia. 
Unofficially, things are a little more complicated. While not 
every  wraith  belongs  to  a  Guild,  pretty  much  every  wraith 
knows  someone  who  does,  or  knows  someone  who  knows 
someone, or knows where to go to find a Guildwraith if they 
need. Plenty of Guildwraiths have set up shop hawking their 
Arcanos specialties in plain sight — every neighborhood has 
its one shop with a Pardoner’s lantern in the window — but 
the attitude of the Stygian authorities is, by and large, one of 
neglect rather than persecution. 

That’s the rule in Stygia. What happens in far-flung Ne-
cropoli can be entirely different. Some cities are known to be 
Guild-friendly, or even entirely under the sway of a particular 
Guild’s influence. Others are controlled by Stygian hardliners 
who see the Guilds as a threat to their authority, and who crack 
down on any Guild presence mercilessly. And then there are 

the communities outside Stygian control, Renegade encamp-
ments and Heretic communes that welcome Guild assistance, 
though not too much of it. 

Behind closed doors, the Deathlords are well aware of the 
Guilds and their power structures: Who’s in charge, what their 
policies are, and how willing they are to make deals. Various 
Guilds have backroom arrangements in place with the Legions, 
offering support and training in exchange for protection and 
the  occasional  blind  eye  from  patrolling  Legionnaires  when 
unpleasant Guild business spills out into the streets. As noted 
above, many of the Legions have also tried to set up parallel 
structures to the Guilds within their ranks, with very little suc-
cess. The most powerful Arcanos variants and arts are the sole 
property of senior Guild members. They’re also the Guilds’ ace 
in the hole, something valuable they possess that no one else 
does, and that would be lost without them. 

The end result is a precarious balance, where the Legions 
permit the Guilds to work in peace so long as the Guilds don’t 
overstep  their  bounds.  Should  there  be  the  slightest  inkling 
that the Guilds are looking to reprise their failed rebellion of 
1598, the situation would change rapidly, and for the worse.

The  one  exception  to  Stygia’s  laissez-faire  approach  on 
Guilds is the case of the so-called Forbidden Guilds. Member-
ship in one of these is automatic grounds for soulforging, as the 
powers they wield and the uses to which they’ve put those powers 
in the past are regarded as an existential danger to Stygia itself. 
Members of the Forbidden Guilds can be found lurking on the 
fringes of Stygian society or burrowed deep within it, waiting 
for the moments when the need for their talents outweighs the 
fear of getting caught making use of them. The Solicitors and 
Mnemoi in particular may be regarded as the next thing over 
from Spectres, but there’s still a steady market for their services 
in the halls of power on the isle. 

PARALLEL STRUCTURES
Part and parcel with the Breaking were ef-
forts by the various Deathlords to replicate Guild 
knowledge and teachings within their respective 
Legions. Much like Nazi rocket scientists were 
secured and put to work by the U.S. and Rus-
sia  following  World  War  II,  high-ranking  and 
knowledgeable Guildwraiths were brought into 
the various Legions in order to kickstart Arcanos 
research and teaching facilities. The idea was to 
give the Legions access to what had been Guild-
only knowledge. The actual result was that most 
of these Guild imitators were quickly subverted 
by the Guildwraiths they’d hoped to take advan-
tage of. Many persist to this day, and many of the 
wraiths staffing them are loyal Legionnaires who 
have no idea that things are not quite as they seem.

SETTING

91

Organization

Each Guild has its own internal structure, but those who are 
signatory to the Compact also participate in the Council of the 
Guilds, a loose governing body featuring one representative from 
each Guild, usually a senior Guildwraith. The Council makes 
the decisions on broad policy for the Guilds as a group, and also 
arbitrates formal disputes between Guilds in order to prevent 
them from getting out of hand. Once the Council has decided, 
all the Guilds — even those who don’t stand to benefit from a 
given ruling — are expected to fall in line. Though the War of 
the Guilds lies centuries in the past, for some Guildwraiths the 
memories are still fresh, and they have vowed never to let such 
a thing happen again. Younger, more ambitious Guildwraiths 
do chafe under the conservative leadership of their elders, and 
friction between Guilds is a constant — no one has yet entirely 
forgiven the Artificers for their original arrogance — but thus 
far, the Council has held and any schisms between Guild fac-
tions are rapidly patched up.

Within the Compact, the Guilds break down into three 
rough groups: The High Guilds, the Working Guilds, and the 
Criminal Guilds. The former includes the Artificers, Pardon-
ers, Masquers, and Usurers, and their talents are by and large 
necessary to keep Stygia functioning. As such, they get a much 
longer leash from the authorities, they have greater wealth and 
prestige than other Guilds, and they aren’t shy about letting 
other Guildwraiths know it.

The Working Guilds, including the Chanteurs, Harbingers, 
Oracles, and Sandmen, are by and large tolerated and their gifts 
appreciated, though they’re not viewed as essential to survival. 
That being said, they can wield enormous influence, and popular 
Chanteurs and Sandman troupes often find themselves invited 
into the corridors of powers unasked. 

The so-called Criminal Guilds traffic in Arcanoi that defy 
the Dictum Mortuum, and as such they’re automatically on the 
wrong side of the law. Stygian authorities work very hard at 
justifying not aggressively outlawing these Guilds — Spooks, 
Haunters,  Proctors,  Puppeteers,  and  Monitors  —  while  still 
keeping an eye out for egregious violations by individual Guild 
members. The Criminal Guilds keep a lower profile, are hard 
to find unless you’re “in the know” and provide services that 
everyone needs sooner or later, despite what the laws say. Ana-
creons and other high-ranking Legionnaires are no different, 
and they know that cracking down on an abuse of Puppeteering 
one day means there’ll be no help forthcoming if they need that 
skill down the line. 

Guild  membership  varies  by  wraith.  No  one  is  Reaped 
already  a  Guild  member,  though  wraiths  now  do  have  pre-
dilections for one Arcanos or another from the get go. To be 
accepted into a Guild requires finding a Guildwraith willing 
to  sponsor  the  newcomer,  and  the  successful  navigation  of 
the various initiation tests and rituals peculiar to that specific 
Guild. Security among the Guilds is tight, as they guard their 
secrets jealously and are always on guard against the possibility 

THE COMPACT OF THE GUILDS
The Compact of the Guilds has been resur-
rected  and  reaffirmed  by  the  surviving  Guilds, 
though its language has changed a great deal since 
the 14th century. Today, 13 of the 16 Guilds are 
signatory to its revised provisions. These include:

Setting limits as to how much a Guild can 

meddle in politics

Describing adjudication for resolving squab-

bles between Guilds

Recognition of the authority of a council of 
Guild elders to decide broad policy for all Guilds

It’s the last point that many Guilds find con-
tentious, but thus far nobody has tried to break 
away from the Compact.

of another Breaking. Becoming a trusted Guildwraith, however, 
can open many doors. The Guilds have allies and members in 
high places all throughout the Underworld, and a Guildwraith 
in good standing can find unexpected friends when they least 
expect it.
Outside Looking In

As noted above, most wraiths are not members of a Guild. 
Finding  one  in  a  time  of  need,  however,  requires  different 
approaches for different Guilds. Members of the High Guilds 
practice openly under Stygian auspices, though they don’t pro-
claim themselves as Guildwraiths, per se. Working Guilds may 
be difficult to track down in a group, but individual members 
can be found. They just may not be willing to admit that they 
are Guild members, or be willing to introduce a stranger to the 
organization. The Criminal Guilds can be found on the wrong 
side of the tracks, and connections are made through cutouts to 
ensure that everyone’s on the up and up. As for the Forbidden 
Guilds, seeking them out is a matter of luck and chance, and 
the wraith who’s looking for a meeting with a Solicitor is far 
more likely to find himself on the short end of a sting operation 
conducted by the Unlidded Eye. 

There are some wraiths who’ve decided the Guild structure 
is not for them. Some want to disrupt what they see as a calcified 
way of doing things, others want the still-considerable prestige 
(and  ability  to  charge  top  obolus)  that  Guild  status  confers 
without any of the restrictions or discipline, and so pretend to 
Guild membership they have no claim on. The actual Guilds 
— and their de facto allies in the Hierarchy — crack down 
on  faux  Guildwraiths  hard  and  mercilessly,  but  out  on  the 
fringes of Stygian territory, nobody’s going to look too closely 
to see if the wraith with the Shadow-stained fingers has their 
Pardoners’ Guild dues paid up. As for the would-be disruptors,

if discovered they’re put under observation. It’s highly unlikely 
they’ll discover something the Guilds haven’t, after all, but just 
in case they do, the Council wants to be ready. 
The Mnemoi

No  one  is  as  reviled  in  Stygia  as  the  Mnemoi.  Their 
ability  to  manipulate  memories  is  particularly  terrifying  to 
wraiths, beings who are by and large constructed entirely of 
their  memories  of  themselves.  And  everybody  knows  that 
the  Mnemoi,  once  the  trusted  judges  of  Stygia,  must  have 

done  something  utterly  horrible  to  have  been  stripped  of 
their powers, exiled, and hunted. The problem is, no one can 
quite remember what exactly it is that they did. Rumors and 
contradictory evidence abound, but as for the truth, it remains 
elusive. Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists among the Legions 
and in Renegade camps put forth a thousand crackpot theories: 
The Mnemoi were framed, the Mnemoi are the Deathlords, all 
of this is part of a long game the Mnemoi are running so that 
they eventually return and conquer Stygia, and a thousand 
more. But the truth remains elusive.

n games like baseball, tic-tac-toe, or poker, 
rules help players play a game without too 
much arguing about what happened: Is he 
safe or out, is that move legal, or whose 
cards  win?  Like  other  games,  Wraith’s 
rules help players decide what characters 
can do without too much arguing: Does 
he push the door open? What if she pushes back to keep the 
door closed? Who wins?

However, having too many or too detailed rules result 
in more time spent looking up section 23-b-3 and arguing if 
that particular rule applies or not than actually playing the 
game. Wraith’s rules define how to determine what happens 
fairly in a way that is simple and flexible, so players avoid 
as many arguments as possible and play as much as possible.
Wraith’s basic rules are simple and are all you need to 
resolve  most  in-game  possibilities.  Some  situations  might 
benefit  from  more  detailed  game  mechanics,  and  specific 
variations and extension rules exist for them elsewhere in 
this book. You decide what rules work best for your game. 
This chapter presents both the basic rules as well as several 
optional rules for some complicated situations. 

Rules and Storytelling

n  Wraith,  the  story  is  always  the  most 
important aspect of the game and strict 
interpretations of the rules always come 
second. Wraith’s rules are intentionally 
abstract;  the  basic  rules  cover  most 
situations that characters will encounter, 
and  you  can  address  complicated 
situations  by  applying  the  basic  rules  to  the  situation’s 
component parts. While the rules are generally suggestions, 
the  further  you  go  from  the  basic  rules  the  more  open  to 
interpretation and debate your game will become. Chapter 
Seven presents advice on Storytelling.

THE GOLDEN RULE

“If  you  don’t  like  it,  don’t  use  it”  is  the 
golden  rule  of  Wraith.  The  most  important 
part of the game is the story; use or don’t use 
specific bits of this book as you see fit. Rules 
should help streamline and enhance play, not 
get in the way. 

Chapter 3:  RulesTime

Time  in  Wraith  is  measured  in  units  of  turns,  scenes, 

downtime, chapters, stories, and chronicles. 

Turn: The amount of time a character needs to perform 
one action is a turn. This can be three seconds, three minutes, 
or any length between those. 

Scene: Turns make a scene. A scene happens in a single 

location. A scene can be any number of turns. 

Downtime:  Downtime  is  the  time  between  scenes  dur-
ing which characters are not actively engaged in play. During 
downtime,  characters  can  rest,  recover,  learn  new  skills,  or 
travel between settings. 

Chapter: Scenes and downtime together make a chapter. 
A single game session is often enough player time for a chapter. 
Story: Chapters make a story. A story contains as many 
chapters  as  are  needed,  with  no  upper  or  lower  limit.  Some 
stories are short and need only a few chapters to introduce the 
situation and build to an ending, while others may stretch out 
and involve many chapters.

Chronicle: Combined, stories make a chronicle. Sometimes 
the stories are only connected by the same characters’ presence 
in them, while sometimes a chronicle has a theme or plot that 
connects the stories together. 

Chapter Nine: Drama gives more advice on how to work 

with these units of time in Wraith: The Oblivion. 

Rolling Dice

Dice are fair: The chance of a die rolling a given number 
is the same for everyone regardless of who’s rolling. Dice rolling 
impartially resolves when a character’s desire meets conflict or 
uncertainty. The player may want her wraith to jump the gap 
between cars of the Midnight Express; the dice tell us if her 
character actually did it. The system is simple, but might seem 
a little complicated at first. 
How many dice do you need?

Wraith requires 10-sided dice. 
The Storyteller needs at least 10 dice. 
Players  may  need  fewer  dice  than  the  Storyteller,  but  a 

second set of 10 dice for the players should be enough.
When do you roll dice?

Roll dice when both the success as well as the failure of an 
action can be interesting. Stopping the roleplaying to discuss 
what Traits are involved in an action and what difficulty number 
the action is, then rolling and reading the result of the dice 
roll can slow down a game session, especially if the stakes are 
low and the action is one that should be accomplished easily. 

96

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

On the other hand, if an outcome matters and there’s genuine 
tension attached to success or failure, use the system and roll 
the dice. A die roll can help determine how well a character 
succeeds in an action, or how long an action might take — or 
that  the  action  fails  in  a  spectacular  manner  that  brings  all 
sorts of new challenges.

For example: David’s character Evan and Rachel’s character 
Ed search an unused library in a Hierarchy complex for a secret 
entrance to a Deathlord’s hidden records chamber. Rolling dice 
and  repeatedly  failing  to  find  the  latch  is  boring:  The  story 
can’t move forward until the characters find the entrance so 
the players are stuck. The Storyteller could decide that no die 
roll is needed, simply announcing that the characters find the 
entrance after a few minutes of searching so the story can move 
forward to the next scene. Alternately, the Storyteller could 
decide that someone comes out of the hidden door, revealing 
its location while surprising the characters. Or, a patrol could 
hear their scrabbling around and decide to come investigate, 
thus forcing Ed and Evan to deal with more pressing concerns 
— and thus breaking the chain of failed rolls in a different way.
How does rolling dice work? 

To make a dice roll, do this.
When a player declares his character intends to perform 
an action, the Storyteller assigns a difficulty number between 
2 and 10 to that action. The default difficulty is 6. The harder 
or easier an action is, the higher or lower the difficulty is. 

Modifiers may affect the difficulty number, or affect the 
number of dice to be rolled. A +1 difficulty make the die rolls 
harder, or having to roll one fewer die makes it harder to roll 
the required number of successes. 

The  Storyteller  determines  how  many  successes  the 
character will have to roll. A success is a single die roll that is 
equal to or higher than the difficulty number. The number of 
successes needed generally defaults to one, but certain actions, 
or Storyteller discretion, may demand more.

The Storyteller also determines what character  Trait or 
Traits relate to the action: For example, sneaking past a guard 
would involve the Traits Dexterity and Stealth.

The  player  adds  up  the  dots  in  the  character’s  relevant 
Traits, and rolls that many dice. Together, all the dice being 
rolled for an action is called a dice pool. 

No successes in the dice pool means the character fails. 
Achieving  the  target  number  of  successes  in  the  dice  pool 
means the character succeeds. The more successes above the 
minimum, the more emphatic the success. 

This is the entire basic rules system, which boils down to:
What action does the player declare her character intends 

to do?

What is the difficulty number for the action?
Are there any modifiers to the difficulty number? To the 

number of dice being rolled?

How many successes are required?

What Traits are involved?
How many dice rolled were equal to or higher than the 

difficulty number?

For example, Evan and the other characters Claire, Althus, 
and Briana are searching the Deathlord’s office when a guard 
opens the door. David declares that Evan grabs an ashtray from 
the desktop and throws it at the guard. The Storyteller decides 
the difficulty number of this action is the default number of 6. 
Throwing an object involves the Traits Dexterity and Athlet-
ics. This is commonly written as “Make a Dexterity + Athletics 
roll.” Evan has two dots in Dexterity and one dot in Athletics 
so the dice pool is three. David rolls three dice for the rolls of 
4, 6, and 9. Two of the three rolls are equal to or above the dif-
ficulty number of 6, so Evan has rolled two successes: enough 
to hit the guard and stop his attack, but not enough successes 
to knock out the guard. Everyone runs as the guard shouts to 
raise the alarm.

Actions

An action is something a character does that might affect 
the story. To perform an action, the player tells the Storyteller 
what his character will try to do and how he intends to do it. 
The Storyteller decides how difficult the action is, and what 
other  game  mechanics  are  involved  in  the  intended  action. 
One  action  generally  takes  one  turn  of  game  time,  though 
some can take longer.

Only some activities of a character are considered actions. 
Walking across the street is generally not considered an action 
because it’s so easy that failure is amazingly unlikely and rolling 
for every trivial action would be impossibly boring. However, 
avoiding being noticed by the Hierarchy guards while sneaking 
across that same street, or breaking through a festival crowd to 
cross that same street before the Reaper you’re chasing escapes? 
Those are actions: You might or might not succeed, and whether 
you succeed or fail matters. Rolling dice can help resolve if, and 
how well or how badly, your action succeeds or fails.

Conversation between characters is rarely an action: Simply 
talking to another character doesn’t require game mechanics. 
However, if for example the characters are fleeing the Deathlord’s 
office while howling barghests pursue them and Claire shouts 
where they should meet after they split up, dice rolls may be 
appropriate  to  determine  if  the  other  characters  successfully 
hear Claire over the noise of the pursuit. 

A simple action requires only a single success and a single 
turn. An extended action, such as holding up a gate long enough 
for a coffle of Thralls to escape, can take more than one turn. 
Alternately, in a split action a character tries to perform more 
than one action during a turn and divides his dice pool between 
the multiple actions. 
Trait Ratings

A Trait is a character’s capability in something: how strong, 
how good at driving, or how much that character knows about 

RULES

14th-century French architecture. The number of dots in a Trait 
show the character’s capability in that Trait. Normal human 
Trait values range from one to three dots, with two being aver-
age. Some people can have four, five, or zero dots in a Trait, but 
these are exceptions. A character with four dots in Gymnastics 
can work as a circus headline performer; a character with five 
dots is a world-class gymnast at an Olympics level of skill.

Roll  one  die  for  each  dot  your  character  has  in  a  Trait 
relevant either by rules or by Storyteller decision to an action. 
If your character has three dots in Dexterity, roll three dice 
when  attempting  to  juggle;  if  your  character  has  one  dot  in 
Perception, roll one die when attempting to notice something. 

Traits are of three kinds: 
Attributes: A character’s capacity for performing Physi-
cal, Social, or Mental tasks. Attribute examples are Stamina, 
Charisma, and Intelligence. 

Ability: What a character knows, learns, or can do. There 
are three kinds of abilities: Talent, Skill, and Knowledge. Ex-
amples of Abilities are Empathy, Meditation, and Bureaucracy.
Advantages: Traits that are neither Attributes nor Abilities, 
such  as  Backgrounds,  Arcanoi,  Passions,  Fetters,  Willpower, 
and Pathos.

Most actions involve an Ability Trait such as Firearms or 
Medicine, and a relevant Attribute Trait such as Dexterity or 
Intelligence. The number of dots in a character’s Attribute added 
to the number of dots in the character’s Ability is the number of 
dice that the player will roll: These dice are called a dice pool. 
For  example,  as  a  Reaper  sneaks  up  behind  Evan,  the 
Storyteller  asks  Evan’s  player  David  to  make  a  Perception 
(an Attribute Trait) + Alertness (an Ability Trait) roll for his 
character. Evan has one dot in Perception and three dots in 
Alertness so he has a dice pool of four. The Storyteller decides 
the Reaper is very stealthy and assigns a difficulty number of 9. 
David rolls four dice for the result 4, 6, 9, and 10: He’s rolled two 
successes, so Evan notices the Reaper before he gets too close. 
Some Traits, such as Willpower, have both permanent rat-
ings and temporary ratings. A Trait’s temporary rating can rise 
and fall during a game, but a Trait’s permanent rating doesn’t 
change as often. Use the squares on the character sheet to track 
changes in a Trait’s temporary rating and use the circles to track 
changes in a Trait’s permanent rating. A character’s dice pool 
in these Traits is usually based on that Trait’s permanent rating. 

Some actions have no relevant Ability Traits so the dice 
pool is based on the character’s Attribute or Advantage Trait 
alone. For example, a character’s dice pool to lift a heavy object 
equals the number of dots in her Strength. 

Only two Traits of any type can be combined in a dice 
pool. A Trait that has a potential value of 10 such as Corpus or 
Willpower generally cannot be combined with any other Trait, 
except under very specific circumstances. It is extremely rare 
for a character to have more than 10 dice in a given dice pool. 

Difficulty, Success, and Failure

An  action  has  a  difficulty  number  that  the  Storyteller 
assigns based on how hard the action is to perform. The Traits 
relevant to the action define how many dice to roll, and the 
difficulty defines how high a number the player must roll on 
the dice for a success.
Difficulty Number

The difficulty of an intended action is the number a die 
must be equal to or above when rolled to count as a success. 
The  Storyteller  sets  the  difficulty  number  when  the  player 
announces  their  character’s  intended  action,  assigning  low 
numbers to easy actions and high numbers to difficult actions. 
The difficulty number is always between 2 and 10. The default 
difficulty number is 6. 

If a character’s dice pool is equal to or higher than the in-
tended action’s difficulty number, the Storyteller may decide the 
character automatically succeeds without the player needing to 
roll dice at all. See Automatic Successes for more information.

In exceptional circumstances, the Storyteller can set a dif-
ficulty of 2 or of 10. A difficulty of 2 is so easy that some reason 
must exist to roll dice at all. A difficulty of 10 is so hard that 
failure is almost certain and a botch or catastrophic failure is 
likelier than usual. For more on botches, see Botch.
Success

A success happens when at least one die in a dice pool 
roll equals or is higher than the difficulty number. A die roll 
of 10 is always a success. You need only one success in a roll 
to succeed in the action. One success in a roll is considered a 
marginal success, but rolling five successes in a single dice pool 
is amazing and grants spectacular results.

For example, Catherine’s character Briana enters a badly lit 
warehouse where a group of Renegades are hiding in ambush. 
The Storyteller asks Catherine to make a Perception + Alert-
ness roll. The number of successes Catherine rolls in her dice 
pool affects how well the action succeeds.

One success: Briana hears a small noise emanating from 

where the wraiths are hiding.

Two successes: Briana hears the noise and also sees some 

movement. 

Three successes: Briana sees the wraiths’ hiding place im-
mediately, without having to take an extra turn to investigate 
the noise.

Players can usually score a single success even with only 
one or two dice. On a standard difficulty of 6 and a dice pool 
of two, players have a 65% chance to roll six or above with 
one die and succeed.

Failure

A failure happens when no die roll in a dice pool roll is 
equal to or higher than the difficulty number or the number of 
die rolls of 1 is the same as or more than the number of successes 
(rolling a 1 cancels a success).

A failure is a simple lack of success of the attempted ac-
tion, not a disastrous failure. In general, a failure should not 
result directly in harm to the character unless the circumstances 
require harm to occur. Failing an action of defusing a ticking 
time bomb should simply not defuse the bomb, but that failure 
should not set off the bomb immediately, or cause the timer to 
start counting down five times as fast as before. For example, 
Claire tries to hotwire a relic sportscar (Dexterity + Larceny, 
difficulty 8). She has three dots in Dexterity and two dots in 
Larceny, so her player Rachel rolls a dice pool of five dice and 
the result is 2, 4, 5, 6, and 6. No die rolls are equal to or above 
the difficulty number of 8 so Claire’s action fails and she doesn’t 
start the car this turn. This is a problem only because of the 
rapidly approaching Barghests….

(If the dice pool roll was 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8, then the roll 
of 1 would cancel the only success roll of 8, and the result is 
also a failure.)

RULES

99

Automatic Successes

If the dice pool is equal to or greater than the task’s dif-
ficulty  number,  the  character  automatically  succeeds  with  a 
marginal success without rolling dice. Their player can roll dice 
to try for a better than marginal result, but by rolling they risk 
a failure or even a botch. 

For  example,  Catherine’s  character  Briana  runs  around 
a corner to discover a tripwire she tries to jump over without 
triggering (Dexterity + Athletics, difficulty 7). Briana has four 
dots in Dexterity and three dots in Athletics so her dice pool is 
seven: She can automatically succeed without having to roll dice.

Optional Rules

This  section  presents  rules  for  specific  kinds  of  actions 

and results: 
Botches: Disastrous failures, which can be very exciting
Multiple Actions and Split Dice Pools: Do two things at once
Extended Actions: Some actions take more than one turn
Resisted Actions: Working directly against another action
Teamwork: Work together to combine successes
Trying It Again: Failing an action can make trying again harder
Some actions can involve more than one of these additional 
rules at the same time: An action such as two characters work-
ing together to push a heavy wardrobe across a room to block a 
door can be both an extended action and teamwork. 
Botch

A botch is a catastrophic failure of an action, and happens 
when no die roll in a dice pool is a success and at least one die 
roll in the dice pool is a 1.

If any successes are rolled at all the result is only a failure 
and not a botch, even if that success is canceled out and one 
or more 1s remain. 

For  example,  Althus  stumbles  into  a  crowd  of  Heretics 
and tries to blend in unnoticed (Wits + Subterfuge, difficulty 
8). Althus has three dots in Wits and two dots in Subterfuge, 
so his dice pool is five dice. Althus’s player Alan rolls a 1 and 
also rolls no successes, so the result is a botch: while Althus 
correctly sweeps his left arm outwards to mimic the Heretics’ 
wave of greeting, his bracelet Hierarchy badge breaks its clasp 
and flies off his wrist, striking the Heretics’ leader on the nose. 
There’s a pause, and then…

(If Alan rolls two 1s and one success, the first 1 cancels the 
success but because a success had been rolled the remaining 1 
would not make the result a botch.) 

A  failure  is  a  simple  lack  of  success  of  an  action,  but  a 
botch is both a great and an interesting failure. You break the 
lockpick  inside  the  lock  and  jam  the  mechanism,  rendering 
the door you need to escape through inoperable. Your ball toss 
not only misses your friend’s outstretched hands but also flies 
through a window in the Iron Legion’s regional headquarters, 
attracting the attention of the humorless centuries-old official 

inside.  Botching  an  Awareness  roll,  your  character  doesn’t 
notice the two guards on the other side of the door before he 
swings the door open and hits both of them.

Botches  are  great  opportunities  for  Storytellers  to  exer-
cise their creativity, as a botch doesn’t have to be as simple as 
simply falling, dropping your weapon, or accidentally hitting 
your friend. The blade could break, or a stumble because of the 
missed attack could break an oil lamp and spill oil across the 
floor. A botched flying roll might not mean that the character 
completely lost control, but could mean that the bag of oboli the 
character had slipped off their belt and is gone. In general, the 
Storyteller should treat a botch as an opportunity to introduce 
a new dramatic twist to the scene. 
Multiple Actions and Split Dice Pools

To perform two or more actions in a single turn, declare 
the actions, select the smallest of the dice pools for the actions, 
then split that dice pool between the actions and roll the ac-
tions separately. The Storyteller may assign a higher difficulty 
number if the actions are unlikely to be capable of being done 
simultaneously, or rule that the two declared actions are impos-
sible to do at the same time.

For example, fleeing from his botch, Althus dives for cover 
over a fence (Dexterity + Athletics) while firing a gun back at a 
pursuing Heretic (Dexterity + Firearms). Althus has three dots 
in Dexterity, three dots in Athletics, and two dots in Firearms, 
so his player uses the lower of the two dice pools and has five 
dice to split between the two actions. 
Extended Actions

Extended Actions require multiple successes and normally 
involve  multiple  turns.  If  searching  a  swamp  for  a  lost  boat 
requires eight successes, rolling eight successes in a dice pool 
would  be  almost  impossible.  However,  you  can  roll  one  or 
two successes each turn and add those successes together over 
several turns.

For example, Evan wants to push a heavy chest filled with 
soulsteel to block a door — he’s not lifting the chest, only push-
ing it a few inches. The Storyteller rules that he will need six 
successes against a standard difficulty of 6. Evan has Strength 
3 for a dice pool of three. For the first turn David rolls 1, 6, and 
6; the roll of 1 counters one of his two successes so he has one 
success. For the second turn David rolls again for a result of 4, 
8, and 9, earning two successes this turn and a total success of 
three. It takes Evan another two turns to roll three more suc-
cesses and push the chest far enough to block the door. 

Not all actions are extended actions: Lifting a heavy object 
that can’t be separated into multiple smaller objects or jump-
ing across a gap that only jumping partway doesn’t help are 
two examples. Reading a book, searching an area, repairing a 
set of several objects, or writing a story are some examples of 
extended actions. Some extended actions involve teamwork, 
where more than one character makes the same roll separately 
and the successes are added together.

100

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Resisted Actions

In a resisted action, two characters whose actions oppose 
one another make dice rolls separately. The character with the 
most successes subtracts her opponent’s successes to determine 
the winning character’s total number of successes. For example, 
Claire wants to intimidate a bouncer in a Stygian nightclub to 
let her into the back room (Strength + Intimidation). She has 
two dots in Strength and four dots in Intimidation so her dice 
pool is six, and the bouncer’s dice pool is five. Claire rolls two 
successes, but the bouncer rolls three successes; three minus 
two gives the bouncer one success, so he does not give in to 
Claire’s intimidation attempt. 

If a resisted action is also an extended action, the Story-
teller  determines  the  number  of  successes  necessary  to  win. 
Both  characters  roll  each  turn  as  a  resisted  action,  and  the 
first character to earn the required number of successes wins. 
For an example of a resisted and extended action, Althus 
and Briana must play tug of war across a chasm for the amuse-
ment of a Deathlord (Strength, difficulty 8). The Storyteller 
determines the winner must score three successes. Althus and 
Briana both have Strength 3 so it’s possible but very unlikely 
for the contest to end in only one turn. Althus’ player rolls no 
successes  and  Briana’s  player  rolls  two  successes  for  the  first 
turn.  The  second  turn  Althus’  player  rolls  one  success  and 
Briana’s player rolls two: Briana subtracts Althus’ one success 
from her two for a net success of one during the second turn, 
so she adds one to her two successes scored in the first turn, 
tumbling Althus into the depths. 
Teamwork

In teamwork actions, each player rolls his character’s dice 
pool  separately  for  the  same  action  based  on  the  individual 
characters’ Trait values, then they add their successes together. 
For example, David’s character Evan pushes a heavy chest 
filled with soulsteel to block a door (Strength, six successes) 
again, but he’s not alone this time. The Storyteller rules that 
the  chest  is  wide  enough  that  three  characters  can  push  at 
the same time. Evan and Briana both have Strength 3, while 
Claire has Strength 2. David rolls 4, 6, and 8 for two successes, 
Catherine rolls 6, 6, and 9 for three successes, and Rachel rolls 
7 and 8 for two successes; together the characters have seven 
successes and block the door. 
Trying It Again

When a character fails an action then tries that same action 
again, the Storyteller can increase the difficulty number of that 
action for that character by one, and increase the difficulty by 
one for each successive failure until the character either suc-
ceeds, chooses to stop, or fails a difficulty 10 roll. 

For example, Alan’s character Althus survived the fall into 
the chasm and escaped. Now he plays cards with a Pardoner 
who knows where the other characters are, and promises that if 

COMPLICATIONS ARE COMPLICATING

Remember the golden rule at the beginning of 
the chapter? These optional rules can add detail 
to the game system, but use these rules only if 
their use improves the experience of playing for 
the  group.  If  these  rules  interfere  with  playing 
Wraith, don’t use them. 

Althus wins he’ll tell him. Althus tries to deal the bottom card 
of a deck to the Pardoner he’s playing with, but fails. When 
Althus deals again, the memory of his earlier failure distracts 
him and increases the difficulty of the roll by one. 

Trying it again isn’t appropriate for all actions: Failing a 
driving roll and missing a turn should not affect the difficulty 
of the next driving action. Another character trying the same 
action  uses  the  original  difficulty  number;  it’s  his  first  time 
trying the action so he isn’t frustrated by the other character’s 
failure. Combat and other similar actions don’t fit under this 
heading. A miss on the first swing of a sword shouldn’t frustrate 
the character and make her next attack harder, because not 
every blow is expected to land. 

Lexicon

he first list contains general game mechanics 
terms of how Wraith works, and the second 
list  is  of  terms  more  specific  to  Wraith: 
The Oblivion. Terms used to describe the 
environment of Wraith and that might be 
used by characters in Wraith can be found 
in Chapter 1.

Gaming Terms

Ability: What a character can do naturally, has trained to do, 
or has studied to know. There are three kinds of abilities: 
Talents, Skills, and Knowledges. Examples of Abilities are 
Empathy, Meditation, and Bureaucracy.

Action: A deed a character performs. Using Arcanoi and firing 
a gun are actions. A player announces an action by telling 
the Storyteller what her character is about to do. 

Advantages: Traits that are neither Attributes nor Abilities. 
Advantages are Backgrounds, Arcanoi, Passions, Fetters, 
Willpower, and Pathos. 

Attributes: Traits describing a character’s capacity for perform-
ing Physical, Social, or Mental tasks. Attribute examples 
are Stamina, Charisma, and Intelligence. 

Backgrounds: Traits describing a wraith’s place and experience 
in society. Background Trait examples are Status, Mentor, 
and Eidolon.

Botch: A catastrophic failure of an action. A botch occurs if 
a dice roll has no successes at all and also has at least one 
die that comes up as a 1.

Chapter: A unit of game time. A chapter is composed of scenes, 
and is often played in a single game session. Chapters are 
generally linked by downtime.

Character: The persona that a player chooses to play in Wraith. 
An actor plays a role in the same way that a player plays 
a character.

Chronicle: A unit of game time. The combined stories of a 
troupe of Wraith players. A chronicle is the largest unit 
of game time in Wraith.

Demeanor: The personality a wraith appears to be. A wraith’s

Dice Pool: The total number of dice in a given roll, determined 
by the number of dots the character has in relevant Traits.
Difficulty: The number that a die roll must equal or exceed to 
be a success. The default difficulty is 6. Difficulties range 
from 2 (incredibly easy) to 10 (amazingly hard). 

Downtime: A unit of game time. Time that characters are not 

actively participating in a story. 

Extended Action: Actions that require multiple successes and 
can involve multiple dice rolls. Some extended actions can 
involve  teamwork  where  more  than  one  character  rolls 
separately  and  the  successes  are  added  together.  Others 
can require more than one turn.

Knowledge:  An  Ability  learned  through  study,  books,  and 
classes. Generally more intellectual than Skills, examples 
of Knowledges include Medicine and Bureaucracy.

power, Pathos, Angst, and Corpus. 

Rating: The permanent value, or number of dots, a character 

has in a Trait. 

Resisted Action: The opposite of teamwork, two characters 
roll and compare successes. The character with the greater 
number of successes succeeds in his action. 

Scene: A unit of game time. A single moment in a story, like a 
scene in a play or a movie. A scene is composed of turns. 
Simple Action: An action that requires only one success in a

RULES

n  Wraith,  character  creation  is 
fundamental  to  the  experience  of 
roleplaying.  Systems  and  character  are 
near  one  and  the  same.  Unlike  most 
games, your character is rarely going to 
be  fresh  from  the  academy  or  about  to 
embark  on  her  first  quest.  Instead,  in 
Wraith, your character has already had a life. It may have 
been cut short, and it’s certainly over, but it holds within it 
a bank of memories, experience, knowledge, and regret. To 
play Wraith, you’ll be creating a character from the ground 
up, and the character’s experiences while alive will have a 
direct impact on the Traits you select for her now that she’s 
joined the choir invisible.

Numbers and points on a character sheet tell us about 
the  makeup  of  the  character:  what  he  can  or  cannot  do, 
what his strengths and weaknesses are, and where he might 
have spent his time in life. The statistics you ascribe to your 
character  aren’t  limitations.  Instead,  they  assist  in  adding 
tone and feel. Possessing a Strength of 3 implies more than 
just being able to lift a certain weight or having triceps of 
specific dimensions. A character with a Strength of 3 could 
be an extreme sports enthusiast, able to lift herself up a rock 
face with just the tiniest of handholds. Alternately, it could 
also be a retired boxer, past his golden years but still muscled, 
compact, and able to land a devastating punch. 

In creating your character, the statistics you assign are 
tools for weaving your character’s story. Traits tell the tale 
of  her  life:  of  the  time  she  discovered  the  most  exclusive 
nightclub in town with her Streetwise 2, or the instant she 
realized (with her Occult rating of 4) that the crazed bab-
blings of your possessed daughter were in John Dee’s Eno-
chian. Absence of Traits rarely means a complete inability to 
perform a given task; they just indicate a lack of training or 
specific expertise. Indeed, low Trait ratings can even result in 
compelling scenes as wraiths struggle with their limitations. 
The occasion your character completely embarrassed herself 
at a dinner with the ambassador (and look who has no dots 
in Etiquette) may still sting her pride. The tragic moment 
your character lost her father to a medical crisis she (with no 
dots in Medicine) couldn’t identify — and the sense of loss 
it still engenders — contributes to your character’s growth. 
Characters can take a long time to gel. Your first concept 
may not be the one you ultimately want to go with, and it’s 
worthwhile to take the time to think about who and what 
you want to play. And there are all sorts of motivations you 
can draw on when developing your character. You want to 
emulate a figure you admire, for example, or you’re keen on 
exploring a character of a different race, gender, or sexual-
ity.  You  like  the  idea  of  playing  the  wraith  of  a  journalist 
whose proximity to the World of Darkness became a little 
too pronounced and who knew a little too much. You love 

Chapter 4:  Characterthe thought of playing a child who wandered off on a camping 
trip and was never seen again, because the story tugs at your 
heartstrings  and  sparks  your  imagination.  When  you  have 
an idea, build upon it using the Traits provided. And as your 
character concept takes shape, his Passions and Fetters will fall 
into place to solidify the idea.

Getting Started

haracter  creation  can  seem  intimidating, 
especially when building someone who has 
lived a complete life prior to the beginning 
of  the  action.  Don’t  agonize  over  fear  of 
character complexity or conversely, in-game 
restrictions. Not every block needs to be in 
place  immediately.  The  following  advice 
should be among the first considerations of character creation:
• In Wraith, you can be anybody. There are no restrictions 
based on age, ethnicity, religion, culture, sexuality, gender, or 
political, religious, or philosophical viewpoint. You’re encour-
aged to make the character you want to play — one that’s fun to 
roleplay and interesting to both you and the rest of your group. 
For the purposes of balance, it’s useful to have your wraith at 
the same experience level as the rest of the group’s characters, 
with experience being a topic worthy of group discussion. If 
you  have  a  greater  knowledge  of  the  setting  and  rules  than 
the other players, you could create a character to lead a Circle 
from a position of age and experience, or you could choose to 
join them on their journey of discovery of the Underworld. But 
you should always discuss matters like this with the rest of the 
group before making any character decisions.

• Character creation in Wraith is a means of discovering 
the depths of your character’s personality, through their desires, 
fears, regrets and more — all the things that drive a mortal soul 
to persist beyond death. What it isn’t is a set of randomly assigned 
statistics on a character sheet, simply there to empower dice 
rolls. Characters need character to make the most of Wraith, 
and the stats they accrue are there as convenient signifiers of 
the shape of the framework the character’s built on. Assign the 
statistics to the character, not the character to the statistics.

•  Your  character  Traits  are  rated  numerically,  typically 
ranging  from  zero  to  five.  As  a  general  rule,  a  rating  of  one 
implies a lackluster ability, two is average, three is the point 
professionals reach and four is the top of a given field. Five points 
is a rarity, implying a genuine gift unmatched by anyone the 
character has ever met. Your character could be focused to the 
point of obsession or be a jack-of-all-trades. Traits don’t define 
a character. They embellish and tip the story points you may 
already have in mind, allowing them to translate mechanically. 
It’s one thing to say, “He was a Formula 1 driver;” four dots in 
Drive is a way to translate that level of skill you want for your 
character into Wraith’s gameplay systems.

• The reason your character returns as a wraith rather than 
succumbing to the draw of Oblivion is key. By definition, every 
wraith has a strong reason for clinging to existence, even if their 
new form is a hollow reflection of hot-blooded mortality. Ask 
yourself why your character is still here. Question whether it’s 
a reason you’re likely to share with other wraiths, a guarded 
secret,  or  fragments  of  an  unknown  whole.  Not  everything 
need be apparent immediately, and your unfinished business 
could have the capacity to expand or intersect with those of 
the other wraiths in your Circle. 

• Ensure your character will work well with others. This 
doesn’t mean you can’t play a former fossil fuels tycoon in a 
Circle  also  containing  a  deceased  environmentalist,  but  it 
does mean it’s worth discussing what will keep your characters 
together. A shared Fetter, being accused of the same crime, a 
specific  circumstance  that  brought  them  together  —  all  are 
possibilities. And if the group wishes to take on opposed roles, 
that can work, too, as long as there’s collaboration on what keeps 
the group cohesive. Some find it tricky to think of a reason for 
disparate dead people to form a Circle, but sometimes common 
cause, shared benefactors or opponents, familiar memories, or a 
shared incident resulting in death can be enough. Mere com-
panionship sounds mild, but the Underworld is a scary place. 
Friends can be hard to find. 

For Storytellers…

A Storyteller should be familiar with the system and setting 
of Wraith and have the framework of a plot in mind by the 
time players create their characters. The Storyteller needs to 
be able to guide players through character creation in order to 
keep the process clean and achieve the desired results without 
generating characters who will wreck the proposed campaign. 
Ideally, the outcome of character creation is a Circle of wraiths 
with reasons to work with and depend on one another. These 
wraiths will have agency within the plot the Storyteller created, 
and will be relevant protagonists within the upcoming chronicle.
When you take on the Storyteller role, it’s your responsibility 
to provide players with blank character sheets they can fill with 
playable details. You’ll lead the character-creation discussion 
with each player, explaining the system and laying out some 
of the plot structure you have in mind to ensure the characters 
are a good fit for the chronicle. It’s worth elaborating on details 
like geographical area, whether the game is contemporary or 
set in a specific era, and if there are any special provisions to 
consider. Also, be mindful of trauma triggers or topics not to 
be addressed in character backstory or motivation. 

As  Storyteller,  you  want  all  of  the  player  characters  to 
have linked plot hooks, ensuring these characters have a good 
reason to work together. This reason can be all-encompassing, 
such as each character having been killed in the same plane 
crash and therefore sharing one giant Fetter. Conversely, the 
Circle could consist of wraiths who died in separate ways but 

106

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

who now come together in the same Stygian waiting room, tell-
ing one another their tales. Long term, it’s beneficial to create 
character links, and doing so keeps the group from splintering 
over a lack of shared direction. If a player proposes a character 
wildly out of place, as Storyteller it’s your role to find a way 
to fit that character in or advise on changes that can be made 
to accommodate her within the chronicle. It can take time to 
make these connections, but they provide fantastic roleplaying 
opportunities if you invest in them.

When character concepts and sheets are done, you’ll be 
running  Preludes.  Preludes  are  character  introductions  that 
take place prior to the actual chronicle. The hours immediately 
preceding a character’s demise or a Stygian day in the death of 
a wraith both act as solid Preludes that allow players to start 
connecting with their characters, and their characters to start 
connecting with the world. They are key to helping players 
hone the all-important Passions and Fetters possessed by each 
wraith.  Preludes  also  provide  players  with  opportunities  to 
road  test  the  character  they’ve  built,  discussing  with  you  as 
the  Storyteller  potential  reallocation  of  points  or  switching 
Archetypes  because  a  Nature  of  Traditionalist  just  didn’t  fit 
as well as they initially thought. For further information on 
running Preludes, see p. 120.

DEAD OR ALIVE DON’T MATTER NONE TO ME

Don’t feel that because you’re playing Wraith, 
all  the  action  must  be  postmortem.  Preludes 
are a golden opportunity to explore the lives of 
characters before everything went the way of the 
Styx. Through exploration of a character’s life, 
Fetters  can  come  into  focus,  their  importance 
to  the  wraith  highlighted  during  these  scenes. 
Another  possibility  to  explore  is  the  decision 
not to define Fetters until after the Prelude. The 
appropriate  objects,  people,  and  locations  may 
become apparent through roleplaying and could 
then be added to the character sheet post-Prelude.

A Prelude can also exist to define a character’s 
role in wraith society. A wraith’s Passions can be 
refined  in  such  a  scene;  political  motivations, 
spiritual  beliefs,  enemies  and  allies  can  all  be 
introduced. Preludes run for characters already 
Restless can provide some much-needed clarifica-
tion on setting and system. 

Mix Prelude types depending on what aspects 
of the game and their characters the players wish 
to explore. You’re running the game for them, so 
open with something that’ll make them feel right 
at home with Wraith.

Character Creation
Step One: Concept

uring  character  creation,  the  first  step  is 
imagining a basic concept and then putting 
pencil to paper to flesh it out. You’re aiming 
for  the  highlights  and  defining  aspects  of 
your character before you move on to the 
minutiae of their life and death. Character 
creation is a constant process of development 
and refinement in Wraith, with your character gaining layers 
as you go.

At this stage, the basics are all that are required. Your op-
tions are limited only by imagination and any restrictions the 
Storyteller has put in place in order for the plot and characters 
to remain cohesive. While some character concepts may struggle 
to fit in with others or with the planned game (the wraith of a 
6th-century Visigoth killed in battle by Byzantine oppressors 
will find little common cause with that of a 21st-century law 
student driven to suicide by unpayable debt, for instance... or 
perhaps  not),  any  concept  should  be  considered  as  possible 
providing discussion has taken place.

At this stage, all you really need do is answer three ques-
tions intrinsic to Wraith: Who were you, how did you die, and 
why are you still here?

Who Were You?

When you were alive you were more than the sum of your 
profession and education, even if society believed otherwise. 
Your core as a human was characterized by what kept you going 
and what occasionally slowed you down. Whether you lived 
a life pursuing an ambition or constantly ran in fear, the most 
important aspects of your life have stuck with you. Following is 
a list of potential concepts that could characterize your wraith:
•  Addict — Whether your fix was drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, 
sex, or danger, your addiction came to define you. Part of 
you loved the thrill each time you fulfilled it. The other 
part was filled with self-loathing and a desperate desire to 
be free. Life after death offers you the greatest highs — or 
the possibility you’ll be hooked forever. 

•  Artist — Many artists receive recognition only after they 
expire. Perhaps you want to ensure your reputation beyond 
the  grave?  Or  maybe  someone’s  intent  on  stealing  your 
unseen work and claiming it for their own — something 
you cannot allow.

•  Blank Slate — You can’t recall your life, or at least your 
real life. You see fragments of a picture but you don’t know 
how many of them are real, or how they fit together. You’re 
intent on discovering the mysteries surrounding your life. 
Who were you?

CHARACTER

107

•  Cop — You were a cop who walked his beat around the most 
dangerous corners of the inner city and took pride in doing 
your job right every day. But you did your job a little too well, 
and that got you a bullet to the back of the head. Now, you 
know that death doesn’t have to stop the wheels of justice. 
•  Crook  —  You  were  proud  of  your  rep  as  a  crook,  com-
manding fear and respect. Then again, your crime was a 
permanent stain on your life. Whether repentant or not, 
you’re now presented with a tableau of victims both living 
and dead. Are you going to extort them further, or try to 
make amends for your sins? 

•  Dabbler — In life you put your hand to a clutch of activities 
but mastered few. This left you feeling unfulfilled. You never 
found your true calling. Amazed by the experiences now 
available beyond death, you’ve now got more of existence to 
explore. Your chance to find something new — something 
that is you — is out there.

•  Guardian — People always needed protection, and you 
were the woman to deliver it. Your volunteer work on a 
suicide hotline helped assuage your guilt over neglectful 
actions best forgotten. In death, you can offer the same 
care and affection to those who need it.

•  Nomad — You constantly traveled from city to city, and 
borders were irrelevant. A free spirit, you were never pinned 
down by family, work, or obligation. Being a wraith offers 
you even greater liberties, and wider vistas to explore.
•  Official  —  You  commanded  respect  and  had  ultimate 
authority over the fates of others. Being the head of any 
group makes you a target, though. Just ask Jimmy Hoffa. 
You’ll soon be able to compare notes.  

Death can be cruel and abrupt. Life isn’t a 
picnic for every human being either, and can take 
someone down twisted avenues. Sometimes the 
harsh facts of life can be more disturbing than 
those of death. Some elements of life, including 
but not limited to hate crimes, prejudice, assault, 
and  explicit  physical  or  mental  trauma  can  be 
thought-provoking subjects to explore in Wraith. 
At the same time, they can unsettle players and 
Storytellers  alike,  and  take  a  chronicle  to  an 
uncomfortable place players or Storytellers don’t 
want to be in this context.

During  character  creation,  feel  free  to  set 
limits if you feel you need them. If there’s a subject 
you don’t wish to explore in the course of the 
chronicle, your group should respect your decision. 
Wraith is a game in which your character’s inner 
darkness is discovered and often displayed, but the 
players’ boundaries should always be respected. 

•  Prisoner — Your living days saw you trapped in a life you 
never wanted. Your time as a prisoner is one you were never 
able to escape, even when the state said you were free. As 
a wraith, you finally have your freedom, and you’ll fight 
tooth and nail to maintain it.

•  Revolutionary — Your existence was predicated around 
subversion. You always felt that someone had to raise their 
voice to bring down the Man, and that someone would be 
you. The corruption you found in living society appears to 
have followed you through to the other side. You’ll fight the 
good fight against the corrupt power structure of the dead. 
•  Slacker — You always seemed to take the easy route, but it 
wasn’t that simple. You had your reasons. And even now, 
conserving your energy for the moment it’s truly needed 
is key. Until then — you’ll just chill.

•  True Believer — You lived for faith. Belief is what saves 
people, spiritually and physically. You may be dead, but you 
never question the faith that guides you and makes you 
whole. And you’re still here so you can lead others down 
the same righteous path.

•  Victim — You never had a chance. The gears of society 
ground you up and spat you out. Somehow you survived. 
Death is just another blow. You’ve been victimized enough. 
It’s time to overcome a lifetime of defeat and strike back.
•  Workaholic — Your life could have been one of grind-
ing monotony or an exciting adventure every time you 
exited your house, but work defined you. Your success in 
the office was all that mattered, but what was left when 
you were done? An empty life, filled with regrets. You still 
can’t stop working after dying, but for the first time you’re 
intent on working on something worthwhile.

Your cause of death will have a great effect on the way you 
view the world as a wraith. Someone who was gunned down 
in his 20s won’t appear or act the same as one whose death 
came in his sleep at a ripe old age. Anguished, drawn out death 
leaves a very different mark than an unexpected demise. Here 
are several possibilities:
•  Accident — Fate is fickle. You were on your sleepy com-
mute to work when the train you were on derailed and 
crashed,  snuffing  you  out  in  a  welter  of  tangled  metal. 
It was such a cruel surprise for someone with so much to 
live for. Bitter, you feel you deserved better. What that is, 
you’ll find out soon.

•  Elements — You may have considered yourself “green,” 
but nature didn’t care. Tornadoes, it turns out, don’t play 
politics. Your death could be philosophized away as the 
natural order of things, but that didn’t offer much solace 
as you hit the ground at speed. Now that you’re dead, you 
can actually manipulate the world around you. Maybe not 
much now, but you’ve got time for your powers to grow.

SETTING LIMITS

How Did You Die?

108

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

• 

Illness  —  Some  illnesses  are  predestined  by  genetics. 
Others  strike  without  warning.  Your  agonizing  end  put 
things into perspective, and you’ll do everything you can 
to ensure nobody else goes out that way.

•  Mystery — Death came as a complete shock to you. You 
don’t know what happened to you, and maybe you weren’t 
alone when it occurred. Whenever you seek an explana-
tion, a small part of you warns that maybe it’s not such a 
good idea to pry. A larger part has to know.

•  Old  Age  —  As  you  got  older,  you  realized  death  was 
stalking  you.  You  did  everything  you  could  to  stave  off 
the inevitable, but it wasn’t enough. After all, it never is. 
Now you’ve moved on, but somehow you remain. It’s time 
to stop living in fear, and time to start living.

•  Overdose — You were desperate to quit, but only after the 
next dose. Even now you feel the urge for one more hit. 
There’s a part of you that’s forever stuck at that cusp of 
euphoria. Somewhere in Stygia there has to be someone 
who can find a way to tip you over the edge one more time.
•  Something Strange… — Not all deaths follow patterns 
of  logic  or  sense.  Being  struck  by  lightning,  ingesting 
mercury thinking it’ll convey immortality, tripping over 
your beard and breaking your neck, getting caught in the 
gears of a combine — what becomes social media fodder 
for the living was the way you met your end. Ashamed of 

the embarrassing way you went out, you simultaneously 
need to understand it and find a way to move on.

•  Violence — Shot by a jealous ex. Taken out by a gangland 
hit. Shoved onto train tracks by a thrill-seeking sociopath. 
Someone else was directly responsible for your end, and 
you’re not going to let that happen to you — or anyone 
you care about — again.

Why Are You Still Here?

There are many reasons a mortal becomes a wraith. Re-
gret, anger, curiosity — all of them can be summed up under 
the term “unfinished business.” Figuring out what your wraith 
left undone that’s so powerful that he can’t move on is key to 
understanding who they are and drives them going forward.
•  Confusion — You weren’t the only one to die in that ac-

cident, so why are you the only one here? 

•  Failure — Whatever it was you were trying to do in life, 
you failed. Now that you’re dead, you may have a chance 
to finally get it right.

•  Guilt — You did a bad thing. Now, you won’t let yourself 

rest until your burdensome guilt can finally be assuaged.

•  Legacy — There’s little more important to you than what 
you left behind. Your legacy will flourish, no matter what 
you have to do to ensure that.

CHARACTER

109

•  Love  —  There  is  love  beyond  death,  from  the  lifelong 
devotion of a married couple to a parent watching over 
his child to a hopeful lover who never got a chance to say 
“I love you” before she died. The power of love can give a 
wraith reason like nothing else.

•  Missed Chances — Regret for all the things you failed to 
do in life anchors you to the Skinlands. As a wraith, you 
won’t let those chances slip away a second time.

•  Mission Possible — Your mission doesn’t stop with your 
death. You may be dead, but you’re still on the case.
•  Need to Understand — You need to know why you died 
in the way you did, and how you brought yourself to that 
last inevitable point. Until then, you can’t rest. 

•  Resentment — The family who moved into your home 
after you died shouldn’t be there. What’s yours is yours, 
even after you’re gone, and god help anyone who tries to 
take it from you.

•  Revenge  —  Someone  put  you  in  the  Underworld.  You 

intend to return the favor.

•  Unfulfilled Destiny —This is all part of a bigger plan. You 
have a grand destiny, and death is just one step along the 
way to fulfilling it.

•  Unrevealed Truth — You died with secrets untold — the 
location of the family fortune, or the composition of your 
secret chemical formula. Now you need to make it right.

Nature and Demeanor

Your public and private approaches to the afterlife may 
differ. Not every clown is truly happy, after all. Your Nature 
is your true personality, while your Demeanor is the face you 
present to the world. They may or may not match, and the 
way  your  character’s  public  and  private  faces  interact  opens 
up all sorts of roleplaying opportunities. Following are a list of 
common Archetypes, any of which may fit as your character’s 
Nature or Demeanor. 

Personality Archetypes

•  Activist: A cause possesses you and keeps you marching.
•  Architect:  You’re  going  to  build  something  better  than 

anything that’s come before.

the meaning of sacrifice.

•  Mediator: Any crisis can be averted through diplomacy.
•  Optimist: Always look on the bright side of death.
•  Penitent: Every action is atonement for your sin.
•  Pragmatist:  Practicality  and  focus  are  the  name  of  the 

game — forget petty morality.

•  Rebel: Someone has to act against the establishment, and 

it’s often got to be you.

•  Rogue: You’ll never succumb to the whims of others.
•  Scientist: You want to know how death works, so you can 

predict and control the results.

•  Survivor:  You  will  persist  and  overcome  in  the  face  of

Why change now?

•  Visionary: Out with the old and in with the new. Change 

is forward momentum!
You may hide your Nature beneath a Demeanor formed to 
deflect intrusion, or you may be exactly as you seem. By acting 
in  accordance  with  your  Nature,  your  inner  confidence  and 
resolve (Willpower) grows. 

A wraith with a Nature of Optimist and a Demeanor of 
Gambler may play the odds to make her Circle feel more posi-
tive about a situation. A wraith with a Nature of Rebel and a 
Demeanor of Traditionalist may transform the system from the 
inside to bring about much-needed change.

Step Two: Choosing Attributes

Attributes are the natural gifts possessed by all humans. 
How agile you are, how persuasive you can be, how aesthetically 
pleasing you look and your ability to think on your feet — all 
are presented as your Attributes.

After death, you take on a new physical form possessed 
of Physical, Social, and Mental Attributes. These Attributes 
must be prioritized, with the most important one designated 
primary. The next most important is secondary, and the remain-
ing category is tertiary. All characters start with one point in 
each Attribute, and add from there. 
•  Physical — Your raw strength, ability to withstand trauma, 
and capacity to move at speed, all contribute to your Physi-
cal Attributes. Soldiers, athletes and burglars are likely to 
prioritize these Traits. Strength is the Attribute governing 
damage you inflict hand-to-hand and your sheer physical 
power. Dexterity measures your speed, agility, and preci-
sion. Stamina relates to your endurance and your ability 
to resist damage via soak rolls.

•  Social — Your attractiveness, charm, and natural skills of 
coercion all effect your Social Attributes. Diplomats, inter-

rogators and performers are likely to prioritize these Traits. 
Your Charisma rating dictates how magnetic a personality 
you are, and how others react to you. Manipulation deter-
mines how well you control others, whether through ploys 
or appeals to their better nature. Appearance is all about 
looks, how striking your features may be — for good or ill.
•  Mental — Your reactions and awareness, capacity to re-
search and retain information, and quickness of understand-
ing make up your Mental Attributes. Scholars, detectives, 
and powers behind the throne are likely to prioritize these 
Traits. Perception determines how good you are at noticing 
the obvious and the hidden, allowing you to discern lies 
or notice you’re being followed. Intelligence is a measure 
of brainpower, and the higher the rating the more likely 
you’ll be able to utilize your encyclopedic mind or research 
efficiently.  Wits  is  commonly  a  reactionary  Attribute, 
determining how quickly you respond to changing situa-
tions, such as combat, arguments, or dynamic conditions.
Every  character  starts  with  one  dot  in  each  Attribute. 
After prioritizing the Physical, Social, and Mental Attribute 
categories, you then assign further points to each Attribute. 
Your  primary  Attributes  receive  seven  additional  dots  for 
distribution, your secondary Attributes receive five additional 
dots and your tertiary receive three. These points can be as-
signed in whichever order and manner you feel best matches 
your character concept. If you’re a private investigator, Mental 
fits well for your primary Attributes. You can allocate four dots 
to Perception, two to Intelligence and one to Wits, creating 
an eagle-eyed observer with a keen mind for research, but an 
average capacity for inventive thought. Alternately, you can 
put three in Wits and two each in Intelligence and Perception, 
making you well-rounded but not superb at any one thing.

Make the Attributes fit the character you want to play, 
but don’t be afraid of throwing in a curveball if you think it 
makes the wraith more interesting. The political advisor with 
an enviously high rating in Manipulation may have a surpris-
ingly high Dexterity due to his time spent as an expert target 
shooter in his spare time, while the gigantic wrestler may be of 
massive Strength but spend his spare time reading the classics, 
and have an impressive Intelligence. 

Your Attributes may seem low, but later you’ll be given 
freebie points to spend wherever you choose. These can be used 
to raise your Attributes if you chose. For now, just aim for the 
general concept you have in mind. 

Note that certain Arcanoi — powers you’ll 
be choosing later — are often based off particular 
attributes. Feel free to rearrange your Attribute 
points  as  needed  to  match  your  concept  once 
you’ve chosen Arcanoi.

Step Three: Choosing Abilities

Step Four: Advantages

Abilities are the Traits describing those things you know 
how to do intuitively or as a result of training. Talents, Skills, 
and Knowledges form the brackets under which these Abilities 
are recorded. The rating of an Ability is typically paired with 
an appropriate Attribute to produce a dice pool you can roll in 
order to determine success. 

As with Attributes, the higher the rating in an Ability, the 
more proficient you are at that given task. One dot implies a 
basic level of aptitude, gained through paying a modicum of 
attention at high school. Three dots suggests professional-level 
skills. Five dots makes you a world-class expert, regardless of 
which world you’re in.

Having zero dots in an Ability doesn’t render you utterly 
clueless or incapable in that regard. Such a void can be filled 
through training during the chronicle, or can play an important 
role in your backstory.
•  Talents — Abilities gained through experience, repetition, 
intuition, and natural environmental and societal pressures 
are likely to fall within Talents. These seemingly natural 
knacks still require endless practice.

•  Skills — Through apprenticeships, the tutelage of a men-
tor, and the need to pick up Abilities for survival, the end 
results are valuable Skills. Skills are typically practical in 
application,  as  they  are  generally  hard  to  learn  without 
rigorous training. 

•  Knowledges  —  Intellectual  Abilities,  learned  through 
arduous study, theory, research, and exposure to new ideas 
are the Knowledges. They’re not limited to dusty academia. 
Everything from hands-on work with computers to field ar-
chaeology to mastering arcane cyphers falls under this rubric.
Just like with Attributes, you prioritize your Abilities. You 
have  13  points  to  distribute  among  your  primary  Abilities, 
nine  points  to  distribute  among  your  secondary  and  five  for 
your  tertiary.  Your  distribution  should  match  your  character 
concept. If you’re a doctor it’s likely you’ll have at least three 
dots in Medicine. It’s less likely you’ll possess more in Melee. 
Tailor your Abilities to your character. 

At this point in character creation, no Abilities may ex-
ceed a rating of three dots. As with Attributes, Abilities can be 
increased later using freebie points. Until experience is awarded 
during the course of the chronicle, freebie points are the only 
way in which Abilities can be raised to four or five dots.

KILLING IS MY BUSINESS, AND BUSINESS IS GOOD
Any Attributes or Abilities you have with a 
rating over three dots can be assigned a Specialty. 
These aren’t obligatory, but can help you out in 
some tough situations. For more information on 
specialties, see Chapter Five: Traits.

Unlike the prior Traits, your Advantages aren’t prioritized. 
You receive a set number of points for each Advantage and can 
increase them further through use of freebie points.
Arcanoi

The dangerous, bizarre, and unique powers wraiths possess 
are known as Arcanoi, and you have five dots to spread among 
them. Starting characters cannot have more than three dots in 
any given Arcanos. Expertise in a particular Arcanos may also 
imply membership in a particular Guild devoted to that power. 
Arcanos powers are split into Common and Initiate variet-
ies. The former can be learned by any wraith, while the latter 
are largely restricted to members of a particular Guild. Deciding 
which powers you want to have therefore potentially influences 
your social circles as well. You can join a Guild by spending 
points on the Guild background (below).

The Arcanoi are as follows:

Argos

Castigation

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Backgrounds

It’s what you know, who you know, and what Artifacts you 
possess that help define your role in Restless society. Backgrounds 
are  the  measure  of  a  wraith’s  contacts,  alliances,  relics,  and 
status, among other factors. Backgrounds can affect the way 
you’re seen by other wraiths and determine your importance 
in Stygia. If you have four points in Mentor, your patron may 
be an ancient wraith of great importance, with a lot of political 
sway. Backgrounds can also paint a nice big target on your back. 
Your three points in Relic can make you the target of thieves 
and saboteurs, as many want what you have. You have seven 
points to distribute among Backgrounds.
Passions

Your Passions are the core of your being, and part of what’s 
kept you hanging on to existence. You never stop searching be-
cause of your overpowering love, or the fire of vengeance keeps 
burning, and won’t stop until you deliver justice. Regardless of 
the details, they force you to persist.

Passions are divided into three parts: A statement of the 
Passion (i.e., “Finish my masterpiece” or “Discover the identity 
of my killer”), a core emotion for the Passion (such as Hope or 
Bitterness), and a rating from one to five.

Your Passions are inextricably linked to who you are and 
why  you  became  a  wraith,  so  you  gain  10  points  to  divide 

between them however you choose. You can hold 10 minor 
Passions, each with one dot, or two major ones with five dots 
apiece. Passions with higher ratings are more demanding, but 
you derive more benefit from acting in accordance with them. 
Smaller Passions demand less, but offer less as well. 

For more on Passions, see p. 304. 

SAMPLE PASSIONS

Some common Passions include the following:

•  Protect my family (Love)

•  Find my killer (Revenge)

•  Keep people away from my car/home/stash 

of gold/art collection (Greed)

•  Find someplace safe (Fear)

•  Kill my rival (Hate)

•  Look  out  for  those  who  need  protection 

(Courage)

Any strong emotion can be the basis for a 
Passion. All that’s needed is an action, the emo-
tion at the core of it, and a numerical rating for 
its relative strength.

CHARACTER

113

Fetters

Fetters are the important physical objects, parts of your former 
existence that tie you to the world. They could be people, places, 
or things. The child to whom you never got to say goodbye, the ’63 
Stingray you lovingly restored, and the creepy shack in which you 
were murdered can all be Fetters. Fetters allow you to engage in 
Slumber, the healing sleep of the Restless. They can also serve as 
lifelines out of the terrifying events of a Harrowing, and possessing 
them allows you to move within the Shadowlands until either you 
come to grips with them or they are destroyed. 

If you distance yourself from a Fetter and neglect your attach-
ment to it, the Fetter rating will reduce. Likewise, those who wish 
to harm you — such as Spectres and exorcists — can rend your 
Fetters. Once a Fetter loses all value, you will enter a Harrowing 
as the Fetter is lost.

You have 10 points to allocate to your Fetters, with ratings rang-
ing from one to five. More important Fetters are rated more highly. 
Passions and Fetters can easily be linked together. If your Passion 

were “Protect My Son” (Fear) 4, your Fetter could be My Son: 5. 

GIVING YOURSELF OVER TO FATE

Your Fetters can be assigned to the Storyteller 
to allocate if you want an air of mystery to surround 
the reason you became a wraith. You’ll know what 
your Fetters are, but you may not understand their 
importance until it’s too late.

Step Five: Finishing Touches

By now you’ll have a detailed character sheet and the bones of 

your character concept have plenty of meat on them.

The final steps are detailing your Pathos and Willpower, and 
spending your 15 freebie points. Once your Pathos and Willpower 
are resolved, have a good look at your character sheet before as-
signing freebie points. These are the elements that will finalize your 
character, so you’ll want to make them count.
Corpus

Each wraith begins play with a rating of 10 Corpus. 

Pathos

All wraiths possess a pool of emotional energy with which they 
power their Arcanoi and heal their ectoplasmic Corpus. Each wraith 
has a starting Pathos rating of five, plus however many dots you have 
in the Memoriam Background. Freebie points can contribute to this 
Trait up to a maximum Pathos rating of 10. Bear in mind that your 
Pathos rating will shift during the chronicle, as Pathos can be either 
lost or regained, based on a wraith’s actions. 
•  Most Arcanoi require the expenditure of Pathos for activation 

(see the individual Arcanoi for cost requirements).

114

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

•  Pathos  can  also  be  used  to  fuel  some  Artifacts,  making 

them duplicate function as well as form. 

Freebie Points

•  Once per session a wraith can roll their Memoriam rating 
(difficulty 8), with each success granting one point of Pathos.
•  A wraith can roll one of their Passion ratings at a time 
that Passion has been explored (difficulty 6 if the wraith 
is experiencing the Passion and difficulty 8 when observ-
ing others experiencing the Passion), with each success 
granting one point of Pathos.

•  One point of Pathos can be spent to change direction in 

the Tempest.

•  By  spending  one  point  of  Pathos,  a  wraith  regains  two 
Corpus levels lost through normal damage (one point per 
turn may be spent in this way).

•  By Slumbering or meditating for eight hours and spending 
three points of Pathos, a wraith regains one Corpus level 
lost through aggravated damage.

Willpower

Willpower is the Trait that determines your mental resis-
tance to aggressive forces intent on wearing you down. It is the 
resource you draw on when you need to make that last desperate 
push and you cannot afford to fail. As such, Willpower can be 
used to automatically succeed on dice rolls. Just as importantly, 
it is fundamental in the resistance you offer to your Shadow. All 
wraiths start with a base permanent Willpower rating of five dots, 
which can be increased with freebie points to a maximum of 10.
Willpower has a permanent rating determined at character 
creation, and a temporary rating that shows the character’s cur-
rent strength of will. Your temporary Willpower is the force of 
will you possess right now, while the permanent rating is your 
maximum.  When  commencing  your  chronicle,  temporary 
Willpower matches permanent. 
•  Some Arcanoi require the expenditure of Willpower for ac-
tivation (see the individual Arcanoi for cost requirements).
•  You can spend one temporary Willpower point per turn to 
gain an automatic success. This is a standard success, and is 
not equivalent to rolling a 10. You must announce you’re 
spending this Willpower point before rolling.

•  Willpower can be spent to enable a wraith’s attunement 

to Fetters, Artifacts, and Consorts (see p. 149).

•  By  rolling  your  permanent  Willpower  rating  (difficulty 
variable) you can resist or regain control from your Shadow 
if it has temporarily seized control (see p. 236).

•  By acting in accordance with your Nature, you may regain 

a Willpower point (at Storyteller discretion).

•  When  a  wraith  loses  (or  uses)  all  of  his  Willpower  he 

becomes subject to a Harrowing (see p. 240).

•  Permanent Willpower is used when attempting to resolve 

Passions and Fetters (see p. 304).

You now have 15 freebie points to spend on rounding out 
your Traits. It is here your underpowered Traits can be pumped 
up to more respectable levels. Freebie points are available so 
you can craft the character most interesting to you. If you felt 
like  something  was  lacking  before,  now  is  the  time  to  plug 
the gaps. Any Trait, excluding Corpus, can be increased using 
freebie points, although different Traits have different costs.

Another option available is to reduce your Shadow’s freebie 
pool by spending points to do so on a one-for-one basis. You 
can also earn up to seven additional freebie points by letting 
your Shadow’s freebie pool increase, but if you do this, you will 
be  creating  a  particularly  potent  antagonist  for  yourself.  At 
this point you will want to start considering how your Shadow 
manifests, what your dark side wants, and all the ways in which 
your other half can get to you. Shadow creation rules can be 
found in Chapter 6.

Spark of Life

At the start of this character creation you were thinking 
of who you were, why you’re here, and  how you feel about 
being one of the Restless Dead. That personalization is what 
we return to now.

Nothing in this section needs to be noted on the character 
sheet unless you want it to be. Indeed, the following approaches 
are unlikely to have any sort of rules impact. Personalization 
has  a  greater  impact  on  how  you  act,  and  how  you  interact 
with others.

CHARACTER

115

Appearance

Your form within the Shadowlands is partly a reflection 
of you from your living days, but can also reflect an idealized 
or critical version. 

The Prelude, any flashbacks, and premortem scenes are 
likely to help provide a solid picture of how you appear. Real-
izing the dots you’ve allocated on your sheet misalign with your 
vision at this stage is fine. It’s always okay to move a few dots 
around if that means realizing your vision more closely.

If you can’t form a mental picture, consider your various 
Traits. What does it mean if you have an Appearance 4 and 
Science 3? Possibly it means you’re the guy in the lab everyone 
doted on. You have no chemical burns, your designer glasses 
set you apart from the goggle-clad assistants, your hands are 
manicured  and  you  smell  more  like  cologne  than  ammonia. 
On the other hand, if your Appearance is a 1 your lab coat 
may be stained, you could be sporting a visible injury from an 
experiment gone awry, and long hours in the lab have left you 
looking haggard and drawn. 
Quirks

Little  features  can  set  you  apart  from  the  masses  of  the 
Restless. Idiosyncrasies, oddities, and twitches can endear or 
they can alarm. These features aren’t the main thrust of your 
character, but they’re part of what you’re known for and how 
other wraiths might refer to you.

CHARACTER CREATION AND DISABILITY

A  wraith’s  initial  physical  form  is  largely 
driven by her self-image. This can lead to some 
variance from the wraith’s “actual” looks at the 
moment when he died — a little less gut, per-
haps, or a little more hair — but by and large the 
plasm reflects the mind’s image of the self. This 
includes  wraiths  with  disabilities.  Simply  put, 
wraiths emerge from their Cauls as their mind 
understands them to be. The choice is entirely 
up to the player. 

It cannot be stressed enough that these are 
character choices on the part of the player. There 
are no bonus points allotted to spend elsewhere 
because of this, and any impact the player’s choice 
has on dice pools, etc. should be discussed with the 
Storyteller ahead of time to make sure everyone’s 
on the same page.

What it boils down to, however, is that in 
the world of Wraith, death welcomes all, and all 
are free to make their way in the Underworld as 
they choose. To say or rule differently would be 
hypocritical.

Maybe  you  possess  a  distinctive  accent,  or  never  wear 
anything other than black. You have the habit of humming in 
times of stress, or you can’t help but clutch those rosary beads 
when excited. Quirks establish a character in his community 
and in the game. Just make sure you’re choosing habits that 
won’t become irritating to you or the other players. 

Example of Character Creation

achel  wants  to  create  a  character  for  an 
upcoming  Wraith  chronicle.  Initially  she 
only has notes and a rough concept in mind, 
so she follows the creation process step by 
step to flesh out the character fully.
Step One: Concept

The first thing Rachel does is create a concept. Rachel 
likes the idea of playing a man in law enforcement. But rather 
than being an upstanding citizen, this character is party to a 
string of illegal activities. Rachel decides he’s a deputy sheriff in 
a rural county, operating on a state border. Rachel also doesn’t 
want to play a character who’s immediately likeable, so there 
will be hidden facets beneath his blunt exterior that will only 
come out with time. She decides he has a teenage daughter he 
loves very much, but he’s been estranged from his wife for the 
last few years. He has a few close friends outside of work who 
call him Eddy, but to most people he’s just Ed. 

Rachel considers Ed’s Nature and Demeanor, and decides 
it’s unlikely he’d share his real self with too many people. So, his 
Nature and Demeanor are likely to be very different. Rachel thinks 
of Ed as a clear, commanding presence, if somewhat bullheaded 
when investigations aren’t proceeding as fast as he’d like. To add 
depth, Ed has committed a few crimes of his own, and he needs 
to atone. He exudes authority, but this is in order to compensate 
for a desperate guilt. Having taken bribes for years from coyotes 
smuggling illegal aliens across the border in his county, he finally 
came to grips with the fact that by doing so he was complicit in 
all the other crimes the smugglers were committing. But when 
he tried to come clean, he caught a bullet for his troubles from 
the very people he’d finally decided to betray.

Rachel opts for Pragmatist as Ed’s Demeanor, with Penitent 
as his Nature. While initially attracted to Bravo for Demeanor, 
Rachel isn’t keen on playing a bully. Ed is forthright but not 
abusive. He takes what he views as the most sensible course, 
and has little time for foolish dreamers or compulsive planners. 
“The hands that help are better than the lips that pray” sums 
him up, and thus Penitent is a perfect fit for Ed’s Nature. Rachel 
notes this as a recent change for Ed, his Nature altering from 
Conniver or Gambler in the run up to his death.
Step Two: Attributes

Ed now requires Attributes. Rachel prioritizes his categories 

as follows:

116

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Mental is Ed’s primary category. When he puts his mind to 
an investigation he can crack it. He knows the law like the back 
of his hand, and in another life he could have been a lawyer. 
Behind his rough exterior is someone who’s remarkably well read. 
Physical is Ed’s secondary category. He’s a fit and healthy 
man capable of tackling crooks and pursuing a fleeing perp. 
He’s a drinker on and off hours, and this had started to take a 
toll on his physique. Fortunately, his untimely death prevented 
this vice from reaching dangerous levels.

Social is Ed’s tertiary category. He has a handsome look 
that can quickly turn imposing. He turns on the charm when 
he needs to, although such talents are weakened as guilt and 
the desire to drink consume him.

Rachel has seven points to allocate among Ed’s Mental 
Attributes. She assigns three to Wits (added to the existing 
one  free  point  automatically  given  per  Attribute,  this  raises 
Ed’s  Wits  to  a  4).  The  remaining  four  points  are  then  split, 
with three being assigned to Perception (raising it to 4) and 
one to Intelligence (being raised to 2). Ed is a quick thinker, 
and is also possessed of the ability to read people. He bolsters 
this with having had an average education and a good memory 
of the law’s finer points.

Ed’s five Physical Attribute points are divided up; two be-
ing allotted to Dexterity (raising it to 3) and two to Strength 
(raising it to 3). Ed is a fast mover, his body lithe and athletic. 
Only one point is applied to Stamina (raising it to 2) as his 
waned in the months preceding his death. The guilt he feels 
made him start to neglect his workout regime in exchange for 
mind-numbing alcohol.

Ed is a handsome guy with striking looks and a winning 
smile, when he finds cause to apply it. Two of the Social At-
tribute  points  are  allocated  to  Appearance  (raising  it  to  3). 
When he was younger he was quite the ladies’ man, but now 
he’s  developed  more  of  a  weathered,  lived-in  appeal.  One 
point is added to Charisma (bringing it to 2). This leaves no 
points for Manipulation (leaving it at 1). Rachel isn’t happy 
with such a low Manipulation rating for a character who has 
to interrogate criminals, so she makes a note to apply freebie 
points to the Attribute later. 

The image of Ed is coming together. He’s tall, fit, and rarely 
seen outside his deputy sheriff’s uniform. His perpetual five o’ 
clock shadow chisels his face nicely, and is offset by piercing 
eyes. With that stare, Ed wins some hearts, and breaks the wills 
of lawbreakers. As a grace note, Rachel imagines Ed as constantly 
grinding his teeth. It might be in anger, but more likely as an 
unconscious tic he has when in thought. 
Step Three: Abilities

Rachel then reviews the Abilities categories. While Skills 
seem like the most suitable option as Ed’s primary category, she 
instead leans toward Talents, due to a number of them match-
ing his character to a T. She selects Talents as primary, Skills 
as secondary and Knowledges as tertiary.

CHARACTER

117

Rachel can already see multiple uses for the 13 points she’s 
spending in Talents. Immediately she puts one in Expression and 
one in Intimidation to reflect Ed’s persuasive abilities. Two more 
are assigned to Empathy to explain Ed’s ability to read people 
so well, and two are allocated to Alertness, as he’s rarely caught 
off guard. His increasing corruption and concealment of crimes 
justifies three points placed in Subterfuge. The remaining four 
are split with three going into Athletics and one into Brawl. 
Reviewing  the  available  Skills,  two  of  her  nine  points 
go into Drive. Ed’s perfectly capable behind the wheel. Even 
more so with a gun, as Rachel allots three points to Firearms. 
Four points remain, so Rachel divides them up with one going 
to Repair, two to Meditation and one to Melee. Ed may have 
restricted his crimes to looking the other way, but he knows 
how thieving works. And as a deputy sheriff, he has training in 
how to use a billy club. Ed’s prone to meditative trances when 
working out or otherwise engaged in manual tasks. When he 
suffers feelings of guilt for the various crimes he’s helped conceal, 
meditation helps subdue the accusatory voices in his head. As a 
wraith, his skill at meditation will help him even further when 
combating his Shadow.

Ed’s weakest category is Knowledges. Rachel’s happy with 
this being the case, as she thinks her character is focused on a 
select few Traits. Two points are allocated to Politics and two go 
to Investigation. Ed is a case-cracker, or was in the time before 
corruption started eating away at him. Rachel believes Ed can 
apply this part of himself again in the Shadowlands, not least 
in an effort to discover who killed him. He also knew how to 
work the system, which was how he got away with taking bribes 
for so long. The final point lands in Academics. Ed has little 
patience for studying, but received an education.

With his first round of dots in place, Ed takes focus as a 
competent, sharpshooting law-enforcement officer, or would 
be if he wasn’t so wrapped up in hiding the crimes of others for 
payoffs. He’s a practiced liar, and possesses a true understand-
ing of his field from both sides of the law. Rachel intends for 
Ed to walk the line between falling back into corruption and 
becoming a responsible upholder of the law.
Step Four: Advantages

Rachel then contemplates Ed’s Background options. As a 
wraith with connections on both sides of the law (and Shroud) 
it would make sense for him to have a focus in Contacts, but 
she’s also tempted by some of the wraith-specific Backgrounds.
Three of the seven Background points are allocated to Con-
tacts. She sees Ed as having a smattering of mortal contacts from 
the sheriff’s office, but more contacts within the Shadowlands, 
represented by victims of the cross-border trade. His death was 
likewise connected to these dark dealings, so he shares common 
ground and enmity with his peers. One Background point is 
allocated to Eidolon, so Ed has a basic spiritual fortitude that 
may allow him to understand his Shadow. She then chooses 
to have two points in Haunt, as Ed is firmly linked to the loca-
tion of his death — a hunting camp on the Rio Grande where 

118

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

he used to go to drink in solitude. The final point is spent on 
Memoriam. Ed is missed by his daughter, who now seeks answers 
to the circumstances behind her father’s disappearance. Rachel 
will be spending freebie points on further Backgrounds.

my  killer  (Determination)  2.”  Finally,  a  little  self-deception 
compels Ed to assert his innocence despite his real crimes. He 
wants his daughter to know that her father was a good man, so 
Rachel chooses “Clear my name (Hope) 1.” 

Rachel’s first Arcanos choice is to put three of her five 
points into Inhabit, as she sees Ed as wanting to screw with 
his  killers  and  badly  disrupt  their  operation.  Inhabit  allows 
Ed to play the gremlin in his killers’ communications devices, 
transportation, and even guns. She’s also keen on his eventually 
being able to create Artifacts with this Arcanos, informing the 
Storyteller that Ed would be interested in seeking out the Ar-
tificers’ Guild in the chronicle, should the opportunity present 
itself. The remaining two points are put in Usury. Usury allows 
Ed to transfer Pathos between wraiths. Atonement being a large 
part of Ed’s character, assisting the spiritually injured is a form 
of penance he’d be interested in pursuing. She keeps in mind 
that at higher levels Usury can be used for stealing Corpus from 
mortals as well as wraiths. It suits the character that he may 
succumb to more selfish activities, so this is a fine fit. One issue 
Rachel notices when reading over the Usury powers is its reli-
ance on the Charisma Attribute. As Ed’s Charisma is average, 
she resolves to roleplay Ed as someone attempting to regain 
some of the charm he once had. This will justify expenditure 
of experience points on Charisma, later in the chronicle.

Many  of  Ed’s  Traits  now  assigned,  Rachel  reviews  her 
character’s progress so far. He’s a criminal, but she’s intent on 
making him redeemable. There has to be a heart of gold, or at 
least an uncomfortable weight of culpability on his shoulders 
to justify his Nature of Penitent. His Attributes, Abilities, and 
Backgrounds justify his Demeanor, but not his Nature.

There are 10 points to spend on Ed’s Passions. Ed’s reasons 
for continued existence are apparent to Rachel, so she goes on to 
weigh up the importance of each Passion. The most important 
one to Ed is protecting his daughter as she gets closer to the 
dangerous truth behind his illegal activities. She contemplates 
whether this fits as Fear, but decides on Love. Ed adores his 
daughter and will do anything to protect her from these crimi-
nals. She writes, “Protect my daughter (Love) 4.”

After going back and forth on Ed’s method of death, Rachel 
decides that while planning a double cross of the traffickers, 
he was murdered with one bullet to the back of the head. His 
swift death was at the hands of an unknown assailant, his body 
was never found, and he was simply listed as “missing.” Indeed, 
the sheriff’s office went on to publicly moot the “missing” Ed 
as involved in illegal activities — the same deplorable ones 
that drove him to his final, fatal action, rather than the bribes 
he’d actually been receiving. Ed angrily wishes to prevent these 
criminals from continuing operations, therefore opting for “De-
stroy the traffickers (Fury) 3.” Rachel’s already planning how 
he would attempt to find other victims in the Shadowlands to 
help him in his mission. A part of Ed can’t move on without 
discovering the identity of his murderer. The only person he told 
about heading to the traffickers’ boathouse was a fellow deputy, 
and she’s not spoken up since his death. Rachel writes “Identify 

Ed’s  Fetters  now  need  to  be  decided,  with  10  points  to 
spread between them. Rachel considers what objects, people 
or locations might keep him tied to the Skinlands, and comes 
up with some interesting choices. Tying them to Ed’s Passions 
and Backgrounds, she decides on “My daughter: 4” as an obvi-
ous choice, and “Written logs of the traffickers’ activities: 3,” 
stored — somewhat dangerously given the events surrounding 
his death — in his locker at the sheriff’s office. “The hunting 
camp: 2” follows, as the site where Ed first made a deal with 
the traffickers, regularly received payment, first witnessed their 
true natures, and eventually met his end. This leaves one more 
point, so Rachel decides to go for a wild card, and chooses to 
spend it on a cherished “Bottle of Overholt 1911 Rye Whiskey: 
1.” Ed was saving it for the day his daughter got married. It 
remains unopened at his house, a testament to both his love 
for his child and his affection for high-end alcohol.
Step Five: Finishing Touches

Ed’s Willpower rating of 5 and his beginning Pathos of 6 (5 
plus the one point in Memoriam) are added to the character sheet. 
Rachel now considers how the 15 freebie points can be 
spent. Her first decision is to spend five points increasing Ed’s 
Manipulation by one dot to a rating of 2. She then spends a 
further two points to increase his Willpower to a rating of 6, to 
reflect his hardheaded demeanor. Two points are spent on the 
Relic Background — Ed’s deputy sheriff’s badge has stayed with 
him beyond death as a reminder of what he aspired to be.  With 
six points remaining, she allocates two to give him a Craft Skill 
rating of 1. The remaining four are allocated to the Larceny 
Skill to give it a rating of 2. Rachel has been considering Ed’s 
hobbies, deciding he was a little more conversant with criminal 
ways than he’d like to admit. 

All  the  freebie  points  now  spent,  Rachel  makes  a  note 
on  her  Shadow’s  character  sheet  that  the  Shadow  can  gain 
an  additional  two  freebie  points.  Ed  is  going  to  take  two  in 
exchange  and  apply  them  to  his  Passion  “Identify  my  killer 
(Determination)” to give it a rating of 3.

The  numbers  now  finalized,  Rachel  makes  her  last  few 
character-creation notes. She provides names of Ed’s colleagues, 
some  of  the  traffickers,  and  victims  also  killed  as  a  result  of 
their actions, with the plan of tracking them down if they were 
reborn as wraiths. Rachel also assigns Specialties to the Traits 
with ratings of 4 or above, noting that Ed’s Wits Specialty is 
Quick-Witted and his Perception Specialty is Attentive, which 
he sadly neglected in life. Rachel makes a quick set of notes as 
to Ed’s wiry, yet toned appearance, and crisp deputy’s uniform 
with a small bullet hole cutting through the back and exiting 
the front of his hat. She also makes a basic family tree noting 
his parents, wife, and daughter, their names and his relation-
ship with them.

Rachel decides she doesn’t want any quirks that would be 
too distracting, and already having settled on his teeth grinding, 
doesn’t want to go any further. She’s good with accents, but will 
gauge the rest of the group before playing Ed with a Texan drawl.
Rachel  now  works  with  the  Storyteller  and  the  person 
playing her Shadowguide on generating Ed’s Shadow. For an 
example of creating the Shadow, see p. 236.

What Now?
Roleplaying the Prelude

he roleplay can now commence. Before the 
chronicle begins in earnest, it’s a good idea 
to run a Prelude. A Prelude is a short scene 
that narrates the events of your last living 
moments, death, and rebirth as a wraith, but 
they don’t need to be restricted to those key 
events. Preludes can be run with the group, 
or solo so that each player can preserve her character’s dying 
secrets. The scenes should genuinely be kept short, in order 
to maximize their emotional impact without eating too much 
into playtime as a wraith, and while they always end the same 
(fatal) way, that doesn’t mean there can’t be surprises along the 
journey. Cameos from other, premortem characters, foreshadows 
for the chronicle, clear evidence of ghostly intervention in a 
character’s death — all of these are possibilities.

This is also the final opportunity for you to find amendments 
you want to make to your character. This is where you find the 
Arcanoi you picked don’t fit your concept after all, or that the 
fourth dot in Firearms was an indulgence. That’s okay — the 
chronicle hasn’t yet begun and such points can still be exchanged. 
Just inform your Storyteller so she’s aware of the desired changes.
Avoid skipping straight to the chronicle if you can help 
it. Individual Preludes for each member of the Circle can truly 
make for evocative and emotional roleplaying.
The Before-Death Experience

Knowing who you were before death in Wraith is paramount. 
You can’t get the most out of your Passions or Fetters without 
knowing why they’re so important to you. If one of your Pas-
sions is “Alleviate the suffering of my partner (Compassion) 
3” there’s little context or emotional clout unless you explore 
what your widower is experiencing. In your Prelude, you could 
have a multipart scene in which you gradually succumb to the 
cancer ravaging your body, unable to do more than just watch 
the emotional toll it takes on your spouse. This type of Prelude 
is moving, enhances your character development, and does a 
heck more than just saying “I had a loving relationship.”

All your Fetters and Passions should be on the table for your 
Prelude. If they’re that important, they deserve to be examined. 
And if you can’t find a good scene for them, maybe it’s worth 
reconsidering whether they carry that much weight. Similarly, if 

you’ve chosen the Memoriam or Haunt Backgrounds, it’s likely you’ll 
want your scenes to take place in a way involving the people who 
will miss you and the places you frequented. In the aforementioned 
example, one of your Fetters may be your partner, the bed in which 
you died, or the photo of the two of you on your nightstand — the 
last thing you saw before the light disappeared from your eyes. 
Having a photo listed on your character sheet means less without 
the interaction with it in your Prelude. Your Memoriam can be 
made up of family and friends who visited you during your final 
days, and the foundation they set up in your honor after you were 
gone. Your Haunt may be the bedroom in which you passed or 
the hospital you dreaded visiting for every dose of chemotherapy.
Preludes allow you to determine how you feel about your 
Fetters. You don’t have to like them, but you should feel something 
strongly toward them. Your character’s overstuffed pill box could 
be a Fetter — a constant reminder of your illness. Similarly, you 
can review the emotions you associated with your Passions. You 
don’t feel compassion for your partner as a result of the Prelude, 
and decide that instead your Passion will be “Alleviate the suffering 
of my partner (Pity) 3.” You decide that in your final moments 
you were consumed by hate. You’re sure it was his smoking that 
resulted in your getting cancer. Through discussion with your 
Storyteller you change your Passion to “Drive my partner over 
the edge (Hate) 3.” It’s a sinister trail to go down, but if it makes 
your character more interesting and fun, then go for it.
The Death Concept

If you haven’t selected your character’s cause of death al-
ready, then a Prelude is a perfect way to discover the culmination 
of your mortal existence. You can play out a mortal story and 
the Storyteller can choose an elegant exit, or you can call the 
shots and make the decision when you feel the time is right.
Awakening

You know who you were, and you know how you died, so 
it’s time to look at the critical moment when you reawaken as 
a wraith. The manner of your Reaping will crucially determine 
how you view the Underworld. The character’s initial experi-
ences following the Reaping — whether they include nearly 
being melted down into coinage, escaping Thralldom, rapid 
recruitment  into  a  Legion,  or  apprenticeship  to  a  Ferryman 
— establishes your wraith-specific Backgrounds, your place in 
Stygian society, and your relationship with your fellow Restless.
This is the time when the reasons for your Notoriety, Men-
tor, or Status can be established. Don’t be afraid to imagine the 
stories behind the collection of dots. A daring escape from a 
savage band of Reapers can earn you notoriety; showing promise 
by doing so can attract the attention of a Mentor, and the other 
wraiths you free along the way could become your Contacts. 

Preludes don’t need to be run in a formulaic way. If you’re 
playing in a chronicle where all the characters have been wraiths 
for centuries, it’ll be less important to experience life as a mortal in 
a single chapter. Instead, dealing with this element as fragmented 
flashbacks during the course of the chronicle could be the way 

120

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

to go. If the players are all experienced with Wraith and want a 
high-powered game of Underworld politics and war, the manner 
of your death is less important than your relationships with other 
wraiths. Flexibility is recommended, but that doesn’t mean that 
there’s no value to a Prelude. These scenes are incredibly important 
in allowing players to understand their characters, so don’t auto-
matically eschew them completely as a result of eagerness to get 
on with “the good stuff.” Preludes drive home the precious value 
of mortality, and set the mood perfectly for the chronicle to follow.

Q & A

THE END IS THE BEGINNING

Preludes don’t need to be strictly regimented 
as life, death, and Reaping. While this is a typical 
setup and one that often works, don’t deny your-
self the possibility of something a little stranger. 
Some options are:

•  Some of the characters are already wraiths, 
and their actions lead — possibly uninten-
tionally — to the death of the other, mortal 
characters. This could be an intriguing Pre-
lude to play, involving everyone at the table.

•  Flashing  back  to  a  moment  years  before 
the  moment  of  death,  perhaps  one  that  is 
thematically  linked  to  why  the  character 
became  a  wraith.  This  sort  of  Prelude  can 
set  up  a  mystery  of  the  wraith’s  existence, 
or demonstrate their Fetters to good effect.

•  Some  of  the  other  players  could  take  sup-
porting roles in another character’s Prelude. 
It’ll  be  good  practice  for  when  they  start 
playing  Shadowguides  if  they’re  given  the 
temporary roles of friends, colleagues, lovers, 
and enemies of one of the characters during 
her time as a mortal.

•  All the characters could die in the same hor-
rendous  terrorist  attack,  natural  disaster,  or 
similar communal horror. Such a scene allows 
interaction between the characters, who may 
know one another already or form attachments 
in their last few moments among the living.

•  Storytellers can always mislead players into 
writing  characters  for  another  World  of 
Darkness game, then having them meet their 
predestined fate quite unaware that you had 
a  game  of  Wraith  planned  all  along.  This 
could conceivably happen in the first session 
— which serves as the Prelude — or further 
along in a chronicle. Just be aware of your 
group’s dynamics if you have this planned, as 
some may react adversely to such deception.

Your  Prelude  will  go  a  long  way  toward  answering  any 
character questions, but there may be more questions you wish 
to explore. Elements of your backstory may have been missed 
in the Prelude, in which case these questions will help you add 
those finishing touches.
•  How old were you when you died?

The age you were when you died is going to have an impact 
on appearance and maturity. Does a youngster deal better with 
having died than someone in the prime of their life? An elderly 
war veteran may be taken more seriously in the Underworld 
than the wraith of a child, who becomes eternally frustrated at 
the lack of respect given to her.
•  What were your friends and family like when you were 

alive? What are they like now?
Sometimes family’s the only sure thing in the world, the 
sanctuary that never dissolves when things go bad. That be-
ing said, how did your family cope with your death? Did your 
independent wife move on to another partner within weeks 
of your machine being switched off? Your kids always seemed 
disrespectful,  but  how  are  they  now  that  you’re  gone?  Does 
your huge group of friends even notice you’re missing? How 
do you feel about these people now? How do they feel about 
you? They might make up your Passions or your Fetters, and 
not necessarily for good reasons. 
•  What life achievement makes you proud? 

Sometimes it can be difficult to choose from the list of a 
lifetime’s labors, while other times it can be hard to find even 
one. Most people have achieved something, whether it’s land-
ing a job despite your lack of experience, or scoring that first 
kiss  despite  your  nerves.  Then  again,  maybe  you  struggle  to 
find anything that makes you truly proud. You think your life 
was wasted, and now you need to go out and do something — 
anything — to make your mark. If you did achieve something, 
is it an achievement that now requires protection from beyond 
the grave? What will happen to you if someone takes it from 
you, claims it as their own, or destroys it?
•  What are you most ashamed of?

Shame is a powerful motivator. Being caught cheating on 
your finals was embarrassing. That time you lost your temper 
with your children was the worst day of your life — there are a 
flurry of options for shame. At least one of them must eat away at 
you in death. You’re not proud of it, but it helps to explain why 
you are how you are. If your Fetters are harmed by the horrible 
truth being exposed, you need to do everything in your power 
to protect your secret, or come to peace with it. 
•  What places mattered to you when you were alive?

Places of importance are useful to a Storyteller, both as 
sources for Haunts and Fetters but also as locations your char-
acters may encounter during the chronicle. The house in which 
you grew up can have a great, formative effect. The corner of 
the library where you used to spend your lonely lunches tells 

CHARACTER

121

a sad tale of incompleteness. The woods in which you and 
your friends went looking for (and not finding) Bigfoot as 
teenagers are intensely memorable. Memorable locations can 
be as vital as notable people.
•  When did you die?

If your wraith is particularly old, she’s likely to have a 
very different take on technology and sociological conven-
tions than one who died yesterday. That said, she’s unlikely to 
have been inactive for the last four centuries, and may have 
picked up some tricks along the way. 
•  How did you meet the rest of your Circle?

It’s  important  to  determine  your  wraith’s  connection 
to  those  of  the  other  players.  There  are  plenty  of  options 
— maybe you share the same political ideas and met at an 
underground meeting, or perhaps you all got bullied by the 
same Legionnaire during basic training in your first days in 
the Skeletal Legion. From there, the question expands into 
where you now meet. Do you have a communal Haunt, or do 
you prefer neutral ground? Your Circle may meet in a place for 
safety, nostalgia, or because they enjoy the music. As a Circle, 
it’s worth discussing your options, based on the location in 
which the chronicle is set.
•  What do you miss most about being alive?

Did  you  have  hobbies  you  can’t  indulge  in  now  that 
you’re dead? Do you miss fine foods and finer wines, or more 
sensual pleasures? Will missing these lead you to try to violate 
the Dictum Mortuum, just so you can give it one more shot? 
Or does the knowledge that they’re lost to you forever drive 
you to find something new?
•  What do you do for fun now that you’re dead?

Even the grimmest Legionnaires like to have fun once 
in a while, and just because you’re dead it doesn’t mean the 
party’s over. Stygia offers innumerable options, from attend-
ing a concert where Mozart performs his posthumous works 
to  the  simple  pleasures  of  going  out  and  exercising  your 
Passions on the mean streets of the local necropolis. Figure 
out how you spend your free time, and if your fellow wraiths 
share your hobbies — or have very different views as to what 
constitutes “fun.”
•  What do you seek?

There has to be a goal beyond mere existence. Your driving 
force as a wraith is part of what stops you from succumbing 
to the intoxicating allure of Oblivion. It’s what keeps you 
sane, grounded, or attached to the Skinlands. Then again, 
it may be what drives you to distraction, keeps you moving, 
and immerses you deeper and deeper into the mysteries of the 
Underworld. Maybe you’re looking for Transcendence, or a 
way back to the lands of the living. Figure it out and keep 
your eyes on the prize.

122

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

•  What do you believe?

Your  beliefs  may  have  changed  since  your  mortal  days. 
The Underworld is enough to shake any faith, or instill it in 
someone who had none. Talk of Charon, an ancient Hierarchy, 
Transcendence, Far Shores, and the forbidding Labyrinth may 
make one question one’s beliefs. Has your faith strengthened, 
altered, or crumbled?

Knowing the answers to these questions — and any others 
you or your Storyteller may think up — will lead to you know-
ing your character even better. And that in turn will better 
prepare you to know how to play them in the face of any threat 
or circumstance the Underworld can bring.

CHARACTER

123

raits detail a Wraith character’s capabilities, 
strengths,  and  weaknesses.  They  allow 
you to translate your character into the 
reality of the game by providing a way for 
your character to interface with the rules 
systems. They also help you understand 
and develop your character, showing off 

strengths and defining weaknesses. 

That being said, Traits are a way to keep of track of what 
a character can do, not who she is. They’re the framework 
that character rests upon — an important framework, but 
just  the  start.  Your  character’s  traits  delineate  the  general 
parameters of what she can do. What she actually does with 
those  capabilities  is  up  to  you,  your  Storyteller,  and  your 
imagination. 

In Wraith, character Traits are deliberately left broad 
and open to interpretation, so that you get to spend more 
time on your character than on your character sheet. Take 
the Traits you select and use them as the basis for how your 
character acts and thinks. They’re there to be a starting point, 
a list of capabilities, instead of defining hard and fast limits. 
In this chapter is a description of all of the basic Traits 
you’ll need to decide on while creating a Wraith character. 
Not every character will have all of these, but the descrip-

tions provided should allow you to pick the ones that best 
fit your character concept, and allow that concept to grow 
going forward.

If you find there’s a Trait you really feel your character 
should have but that doesn’t appear in the chapter, talk to 
your Storyteller about creating it in a way that serves your 
character  without  destabilizing  the  chronicle.  If  adding  a 
new, previously undefined Skill is what your character needs 
to be fully fleshed out, then work with your Storyteller to 
define that Skill. 

Specialties

Certain types of Traits (Attributes and Abilities) can 
have specialties. If a wraith has a rating of 4 or higher in a 
Trait, he may choose a specialty — an aspect of that Trait in 
which he has a particular aptitude. A specialty in Dexterity 
could be described as Speed; a specialty in Drive could be 
Rush-Hour Traffic or Off Road. A wraith with the Rush-Hour 
Traffic specialty would thus be a very good driver normally, 
but especially adept at weaving through the evening traffic 
snarls. Every time a wraith uses his specialty, he has the op-
portunity to reroll all 10s on the initial roll in an attempt to 
gain additional successes.

Chapter 5:  TraitsBasic Abilities
Lifesight 

ifesight is the ability common to all wraiths 
to see the life force still extant within a living 
being. This manifests to a wraith’s eye as an 
aura, with the color and strength of the aura 
relating to the subject’s mood and health.

If a wraith wants to try reading the aura, 
the roll is Perception + Empathy, difficulty 
5. The greater the number of successes, the deeper the wraith’s 
understanding of the target’s current health, mood, and state 
of mind. One success gets a general sense for how the mortal is 
feeling, while four is practically reading their mind.

Deathsight

Deathsight lets wraiths view the Oblivion within all things. 
Objects and individuals appear not as they are but as they will 
be, gaunt and decayed. However, wraiths can use Deathsight 
to measure the amount of Oblivion in something. This enables 
a wraith to spot weak points or determine how much health 
a living being has. To exercise Deathsight in this fashion and 
either  Discern  Weakness  or  Sense  Health,  the  wraith  rolls 
Perception + Awareness, difficulty 5. The number of successes 
indicates the detail the wraith is able to observe. One success 
might let a wraith know that a mortal is ill, while four successes 
pinpoints a yet-undiscovered tumor that’s sapping their life. A 
weak spot identified through Deathsight, be it on a building or 
a person, offers a –1 difficulty to hit.

Heightened Senses

Wraiths are unusually well attuned to the world. They hear 
more clearly, see more sharply and sense more accurately the 
state of the world around them than the living. That makes 
them good at overhearing whispers, noticing small details and 
otherwise picking up on things that a mere mortal would have 
missed. At Storyteller discretion, a wraith can roll Perception 
+ Alertness (difficulty 5) to pick out a detail that otherwise 
might have escaped them.

Note that heightened senses can have a drawback. They 
can be overwhelmed by an excess of stimulus, causing the wraith 
severe discomfort (though no actual Corpus loss).

Insubstantiality

Perhaps  the  defining  trait  of  a  wraith’s  existence,  In-
substantiality is both a blessing and a curse. With a minimal 
expenditure of Corpus a wraith can walk through walls — or 
bullets, but without the help of Arcanoi the simplest touch into 
the Skinlands is beyond them.

Archetypes

very wraith has a personality they project and 
another they conceal. These personalities 
fall  under  the  heading  of  Archetypes. 
The  displayed  Archetype  is  the  wraith’s 
Demeanor: a wraith’s mask used to face the 
Underworld and all who dwell within it. The 
hidden  Archetype  is  the  wraith’s  Nature: 
a true personality, dangerous to reveal. By knowing a wraith’s 
Nature, one closes in on a wraith’s Passions. Such knowledge 
is potent leverage.

Archetypes are rough personality types, not defining but 
instead providing a framework for the player. They are good 
guidelines to which to refer when faced with the question, “How 
would my wraith act in this scenario?”

Willpower points are recovered when a wraith acts in ac-
cordance with her Nature. Whenever a player feels she’s played 
her wraith’s Nature, she should refer to the Storyteller to check 
whether it justifies the gain of up to three Willpower points. It’s 
easy to play a Nature straight and gain a single Willpower point, 
but doing so is risky. It exposes the wraith’s innermost motives 
to any observers of the action. Playing a Nature surreptitiously, 
by cloaking it in the wraith’s Demeanor, can be worthy of two 
or even three Willpower points. 

Contrasting Natures and Demeanors can lead to exciting 
roleplaying possibilities. A wraith could attempt to maintain a 
façade of calm Bureaucrat, while underneath the ambitions of a 
passionate Activist rage. On the other hand, closer Natures and 
Demeanors encourage more nuanced play. A wraith’s Demeanor 
of Jester could be an over-exaggeration of her Optimist Nature. 
In order to remain as positive as her Nature dictates, she can’t 
help but make dark comedy in the grimmest situations. 

Choose Archetypes to fit the character concept and that 
interest you as a player. If none of the Archetypes listed below 
match the character you’ve got in mind, work with your Story-
teller to create a new one. Archetypes for the wraith’s Shadow 
can be found on p. 227.

Activist

The  Activist  is  a  wraith  who  instigates,  campaigns  for, 
and  participates  in  change.  He  recognizes  the  Underworld’s 
issues and protests them in order to make things improve. The 
Activist aggressively stands up to the forces that appall him, 
regardless of whether they originate in a local Necropolis or 
from one of the Deathlords’ thrones. Sloth and apathy drive 
the Activist to frustration. Obstacles against his taking action 
force him to anger.

The Activist regains Willpower every time he takes a suc-

cessful action to further his chosen cause.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Architect

The Architect carefully plans for the future. She’s a creator, 
and knows creation to be the greatest weapon against Oblivion. 
The uncontrollable must be surveyed, organized, and put toward 
a better, useful purpose. She doesn’t just plan the construction 
of objects —  society itself can be built better and stronger.

The Architect regains Willpower every time a long-term 

plan she has created comes to fruition.

Bravo

Avant-Garde

The Avant-Garde is a pioneer of invention. Unafraid to 
experiment and innovate, the Avant-Garde produces and sup-
ports whatever she can that is exciting and new. To her, being 
dead is no barrier to discovery and growth. The Avant-Garde 
is unafraid of controversy or what the neighbors might think. 
She despises bland repetition, and always seeks new experiences.
The Avant-Garde regains Willpower every time she experi-

ences something new and controversial.

Bon Vivant

The Bon Vivant sees death as an opportunity to revel. 
He  faces  Oblivion  with  a  cocktail  in  hand  and  a  lover  on 
his arm. Hedonism isn’t escapism for the Bon Vivant — it’s 
the only logical response to Oblivion. Such a view can lead 

to short-sightedness, but if the choice is between embracing 
absolute pleasure or succumbing to tedium, then that choice 
is easy to make.

The  Bon  Vivant  regains  Willpower  every  time  he  truly 

indulges and expresses his enjoyment.

The Bravo never shows fear. She’ll happily put others down 
if doing so improves her standing, and does it for fun even if 
it doesn’t benefit her directly. She’s a bully, more inclined to 
continue a losing battle than compromise with the victor, even 
against unstoppable odds. The Bravo is good to have on your 
side in a conflict, but woe to those who cross her. Defeat leads 
to wracking self-doubt for the Bravo, or pushes her to danger-
ous extremes instead.

The Bravo regains Willpower every time she beats someone 

down, verbally or physically.

Bureaucrat

The Bureaucrat works the system from within. He recognizes 
the need for regulations, forms, and ordered queuing. Patience 
and organization are typical strengths of the Bureaucrat, who 
follows every procedure. The Bureaucrat understands rules and 
red tape can stifle initiative, but only by working steadily via 
the correct channels can security be maintained. 

TRAITS

127

The Bureaucrat regains Willpower every time he uses the 

established rules to deal with a situation.

The Caregiver finds meaning in helping others. If there’s 
another wraith who needs assistance or just someone to listen, 
she’s the first to demonstrate compassion. Though some wraiths 
take advantage of this kindness, the Caregiver knows it’s only 
through looking out for one another that wraiths can resist the 
pull of Oblivion.

The Caregiver regains Willpower every time she success-

fully protects and nurtures another.

Caregiver

Child

The Child sees the Underworld without cynicism or bit-
terness. Every journey is an undiscovered adventure, one the 
child  can’t  wait  to  embark  upon.  The  Child’s  enthusiasm  is 
infectious, her spark of vitality a beacon of hope in the Un-
derworld. However, her patience is thin, and when she wants 
something she wants it now. She’s endearing, but some wraiths 
take exception to such naiveté.

The Child regains Willpower every time she gets her own 

way despite the objections of others.

Competitor

The  Competitor  is  determined  to  be  the  best.  He’s  the 
hardest worker and hones his skills relentlessly until they’re 
superior. The Competitor measures himself against others and 
will do whatever it takes to beat them head to head. This can 
result in trouble and unwinnable situations, but also empowers 
his drive to excellence. 

The Competitor regains Willpower every time he succeeds 

at a competitive challenge.

Conniver

The Conniver knows everyone’s out there waiting to be 
played. She’ll dupe them all and come out untouched on the 
other side. And the best part is, she’ll do it with the knowledge 
someone else will take the fall for whatever she’s done. It’s the 
act of getting away with something, far more than the actual 
deed itself, that excites the Conniver, and suckering someone 
else in the process is the icing on the cake. Nothing is worse 
for the Conniver than to be alone without someone to outwit. 
The Conniver regains Willpower every time she convinces 

someone else to do something that benefits only her.

Fanatic

advice without the sarcasm or judgement; those he doesn’t get 
the full force of his critique. 

The Critic regains Willpower every time he points out some-
one else’s flaw, and through its exposure provably reduces harm.

The Deviant stands out as frankly different. Her preferences 
don’t match those of the surrounding culture, but she won’t 
stop  practicing  them.  She  sees  no  reason  to  conform  when 
there’s more to be gained through independent thought and 
experience. Others judge the Deviant, but she remains stalwart 
in her pursuits, daring her critics to comment.

The Deviant regains Willpower every time she blatantly 

flouts social mores and benefits as a result.

To be an Enigma is to walk apart from all the wraiths around 
him. He erects obfuscations around his actions, enjoying the 
fact that everyone considers him a puzzle to be solved. Hating 
predictability, he takes pleasure in being hard to anticipate. His 
actions have logic, but he’s only happy if no one else is privy to it. 
The  Enigma  regains  Willpower  every  time  someone  is 
confused by his actions, which later turn out to be worthwhile.

Deviant

Enigma

Explorer

The Explorer is possessed by wanderlust and the need for 
adventure.  She  views  the  Underworld  as  one  rich  prospect 
offering  endless  possibilities  for  discovery,  and  this  in  turn 
drives her constantly to seek out its limits. From the unknown 
spaces on the map to the boundaries of what can be done with 
Arcanoi, she always wants to find out what’s around the next 
corner. What’s done is done, and what matters is what comes 
next. Part of her worries there will one day be no new treasures 
to find, but those anxieties are brushed aside. There will always 
be new horizons to discover.

The Explorer regains Willpower every time she discovers 

something previously unknown.

The Fanatic is consumed by her belief. She does not care 
how others perceive her, for her cause is righteous and all those 
who stand in her way do so at their own risk. Advancing along 
the road toward that goal provides only fleeting triumph, as 
there’s always more to do to in the service of her creed. Impossible 
to dissuade, she’ll tackle any odds in the service of her belief. 
The Fanatic regains Willpower every time, when fueled by 
zeal, she successfully completes a task related to her core belief.

Critic

128

The  Critic  is  the  first  to  spot  another’s  flaws  and  point 
them out — but only in the interest of helping them improve, 
of course. His goal is to help others perfect themselves through 
his advice, even if not everyone has enough self-confidence to 
react well to his honesty. To those he cares about, he gives sage

The Follower recognizes an excellent leader and flourishes 
by supporting her. He offers advice from behind or beside the 
throne, his loyalty never in doubt. Freed from the responsibili-

ties of command, he can function to best effect by putting his 
efforts at someone else’s disposal. Always looking for a stronger 
personality to support, the Follower can be a loyal, capable ally, 
allowing a strong leader to be even more effective. 

The Follower regains Willpower every time he demonstrates 

absolute loyalty under trying circumstances.

Mediator

Gambler

The Gambler risks it all just to feel a tiny spark of life again, 
upping the stakes in order to get the thrill of beating the odds. 
She’s sure she can win when the chips are down, and that any 
setback’s a temporary one. The thrill of existence is the risk of 
losing it all, and the rush when a bet pays off. She trusts her 
luck and skill equally, and will lay them on the line against 
anything Oblivion can come up with.

The  Gambler  regains  Willpower  every  time  she  comes 
up against unwinnable odds and somehow emerges the victor.

The Jester knows the strongest weapon against Oblivion is 
humor. To laugh in the face of Oblivion is to deny it any power. 
Though the Jester’s timing may not always be the best — the 
compulsion to make a joke out of everything can wreak havoc 
with trying to commune with one’s Passions — their unflagging 
good humor can be more infuriating to a ravening Spectre than 
a fully armed Centurion.

The Jester regains Willpower every time he makes a dire 

situation lighter through comedy.

Jester

Leader

The  Leader  is  a  wraith  who  knows  she’s  the  only  one 
capable of doing what must be done. Incapable of just sitting 
by while things are done poorly, she’ll step up and take charge 
when the situation demands it. A natural at giving orders, the 
Leader  cares  less  about  others’  feelings  than  she  does  about 
making sure things get done right. 

The  Leader  regains  Willpower  every  time  she  assumes 

Pragmatist

control of a situation.

Martyr

The Martyr knows the meaning of sacrifice. He puts his 
own Fetters on the line to achieve the objective at hand. The 
Martyr suffers to see a cause reach its just end, and loudly pro-
claims all that’s being lost in exchange for the greater goal. He 
doesn’t want a reward, but he does seek recognition for all he’s 
prepared to surrender. Sometimes misunderstood as suicidal, 
the Martyr simply knows that to achieve great things, someone 
has to pay the price.

The  Martyr  regains  Willpower  every  time  he  sacrifices 
a  definable  resource  or  suffers  demonstrable  harm  so  others 
may gain.

Rebel

The Mediator knows how important compromise can be, 
and seeks to avoid conflict. She pursues give and take no mat-
ter who the parties are, knowing that unless both sides benefit, 
clashes can escalate to cataclysmic levels. While there’s always 
the fear her involvement might makes things worse, she knows 
someone has to be the impassioned voice of reason when the 
stakes are so high. 

The Mediator regains Willpower every time she convinces 

others to compromise on a high-stakes disagreement.

The Optimist knows things could be a lot worse, but with 
a little effort they’re going to get better. He sees the positive 
side of having survived death, and presses the realization on 
everyone. The Optimist vigilantly aims to keep spirits high, 
helping to show others that even in the Underworld, it’s not 
just doom and gloom. This, in his opinion, is the best way to 
fight Oblivion and its sidekick, despair. 

The Optimist regains Willpower every time he discovers 

and champions the bright side to an otherwise grim event.

Optimist

Penitent

The Penitent needs to make up for all the terrible things 
he’s done. Every action he takes is done with an eye toward 
atonement, while every misstep redoubles his determination 
to make good in the end. Doing so may not always be to his 
advantage, but such is the price of redemption. From the out-
side, it may look like the Penitent teeters on the brink of being 
self-destructive, but he knows his suffering is a badge of honor, 
and every scar is a sin washed away.

The  Penitent  regains  Willpower  every  time  he  makes 

heartfelt reparation for a previous error.

The Pragmatist’s complete focus is on reaching her goal, 
no matter what it takes. She has a matter-of-fact approach to 
the inhabitants of the Underworld, knowing an omelet can’t 
be made without breaking a few eggs. It’s all well and good to 
debate moral niceties, but when there’s a Maelstrom pounding 
on the door, solutions are what matters. Others might think this 
makes the Pragmatist cold, but they can’t argue with the results. 
The Pragmatist regains Willpower every time she succeeds 

by putting the goal first.

The Rebel sees authority and needs to tear it down. He 
despises the establishment, seeing it as a force of oppression. 
That doesn’t mean he has anything in mind to replace it with; 
it’s just that what exists now needs to come crashing down. Oc-

Survivor

Rogue

Scientist

The pinnacle of both self-interest and self-sufficiency, the 
Rogue looks out for herself. She uses society for her own benefit 
but doesn’t think its rules apply to her; as far as she’s concerned, 
regulations are for people who can’t think on their feet. Others 
may despair of her focus on herself, but the Rogue’s charm and 
sunny disposition usually win them over in the end.

The Rogue regains Willpower every time her self-centered 
disposition leads to demonstrable advantages, in the form of 
material profit or favors to be repaid.

The Survivor never surrenders or backs down, even in the 
face of Oblivion. She resists every obstacle thrown her way and 
overcomes each adversity. Her will is indomitable. She knows 
even as others fall by the wayside, she’ll keep going no matter 
how  impossible  the  odds.  Her  Shadow  may  attempt  to  chip 
away at her cast-iron self-discipline, but she resists even that 
malevolent voice with gritted teeth and clenched fists.

The Survivor regains Willpower every time she survives 
a dangerous situation through grit and determination, or her 
encouragement causes someone else to do so.

The  Scientist  knows  the  Underworld  is  possessed  of 
patterns and logic, and he strives to understand and master 
both.  Every  encounter  he  experiences  brings  him  closer  to

his eyes, altering the status quo is an unnecessary risk — just 
look what happened to Charon. He’ll fight tooth and nail to 
preserve the old ways, believing he’s fighting to prevent disaster.
The  Traditionalist  regains  Willpower  every  time  one  of 
his  previously  espoused  positions  ends  up  being  the  correct 
course of action.

Visionary

The Visionary knows a better tomorrow awaits, and is un-
afraid to say so. She sees the path to that shining future clearly, 
but taking it requires guts and a willingness to throw caution 
to the wind. The Visionary knows if her vision fails she’ll be 
decried as a fraud, but believes in what she’s doing. Her vision 
gives her strength and lends it to those around her. In turn, her 
vision’s reinforced by others supporting her journey. 

The Visionary regains Willpower every time she convinces 
others to follow her vision, without providing evidence to back 
up its veracity.

Attributes

ttributes  are  the  basic  descriptors  of  a 
wraith, and they affect all of his interactions 
with  others  and  the  Underworld.  Based 
partially upon a wraith’s self-perception, 
Attributes rate how the wraith’s Corpus 
compares physically (and how his Psyche 
compares  socially  and  mentally)  with 
those  of  his  peers  in  the  afterlife.  A  wraith’s  Corpus  and 
capabilities are based on his longstanding knowledge of what 
he is capable of, and are no more susceptible to change than 
the Attributes of the living are.

Physical Attributes

Why  any  wraith  should  be  stronger,  weaker,  or  faster 
than another is unknown, but a wraith’s Corpus conforms to 
her preconceptions of it, which mold it and its capabilities to 
match her mortal body even before the Caul has been removed. 
Physical Attributes are the easiest of a wraith’s Traits to define 
and comprehend, and are the ones most often used in terms of 
game system mechanics.
Strength

Strength is the measure of your physical ability to change 
the world around you, whether by damaging another wraith, 
lifting something, or trying to displace a resting object. How 
much physical damage you can do is based upon your Strength 
score, and this Attribute is also used for jumps, leaps, and other 
activities that draw on raw physical power. Strength is used to 
determine the base number of dice used in physical attacks.

Specialties: Buff, Ripped, Mighty, Country Strong, Wiry, 

Large, Husky, Able-Bodied

Weakling: No comment necessary.
Average: You could bench press your own weight.
Good: You were exceptionally strong.

• 
•• 
••• 
••••  Exceptional: MMA fighters envied the force of your 

haymaker.

•••••  Outstanding: Olympic-caliber powerlifter.
Dexterity

Dexterity is a matter of both fine and gross motor skills. It 
rates how fast you run, how well you handle a needle and thread, 
and everything in between that relates to speed, grace and control. 
Dexterity is also used to set the base number of dice in order to 
determine whether or not you hit a target in combat.

Specialties: Fast, Quick, Delicate, Steady, Deft, Catlike, 

Lithe, Flexible, Sure-Footed
• 

•• 

Poor:  You  routinely  cut  yourself  while  shaving  or 
making salads.
Average:  You  could  handle  sharp  objects  without 
hurting yourself.
Good: You could juggle easily.

••• 
••••  Exceptional: You could juggle knives easily.
•••••  Outstanding:  You  had  the  grace  and  litheness  of  a 

jungle cat.

Stamina

Stamina  is  the  Attribute  that  determines  your  Corpus’ 
coherency. It’s a measure of how well your body stays together 
when outside forces are trying to rip it apart. It also determines 
just how long your body can maintain physical exertion and 
how well you resisted disease, torture, and pain while you were 
alive. In game terms, Stamina is used to determine the base 
number of dice in order to soak damage.

Specialties: Tough, Tireless, Enduring, Determined, Tena-

cious, Relentless, Resilient
• 
•• 

Poor: Colds routinely kept you home from work.
Average: Insurance companies deemed you an “ac-
ceptable risk.”
Good: Broken bones barely slowed you down.
••• 
••••  Exceptional:  Marathons  were  a  hobby,  triathlons  a 

calling.

•••••  Outstanding: You survived being given enough poison to 
kill an elephant, being shot three times, getting stabbed 
over 10 times, beaten by at least five people, tied up, 
placed in a sack, and dumped in a freezing river.

Social Attributes

Social  Attributes  determine  how  well  a  wraith  is  able 
to deal with others. They help define how the wraith places 
himself in society and how he relates to other wraiths, regard-
less of political affiliation or social standing. Social Attributes 
are useful in any sort of interpersonal interaction, from sweet

talking records out of a Hierarchy functionary to being the life 
of a dead man’s party. 
Charisma

Charisma defines your overt presence with other wraiths. 
It determines how well you attract others, persuade them, or 
lead them willingly. Wraiths who are affected by Charisma feel 
that they are acting of their own free will; Charisma works by 
appeal, not through trickery.

Specialties: Smooth, Eloquent, Classy, Savoir-Faire, Genial, 

Well-Mannered, Urbane, Sophisticated, Folksy, Captivating
• 

Poor: You were shunned on the playground — and 
for the rest of your life.

•• 
••• 
••••  Exceptional: People felt guilty about disagreeing with 

you, even slightly.

•••••  Outstanding:  You  could  have  led  a  nation  —  or  a 

religion.

Manipulation

Manipulation is the flip side of Charisma, for it is the ability 
to bring wraiths onto your side without them realizing it, rather 
than convincing them to do so voluntarily. It is the knack for 
getting others to perform actions without their initial consent, 
and as such does carry risks. People do not like to realize that 
they have been fooled, so a failure on a Manipulation roll can 
carry consequences.

Specialties: Glib, Persuasive, Cunning, Logical, Remorse-

you.

Appearance

The  Appearance  Attribute  is  not  merely  your  physical 
looks,  but  also  your  ability  to  create  a  definite  impression. 
While the other two Social Attributes require time and con-
versation to function, Appearance allows basic concepts to be 
communicated instantly and silently through the nuances of 
body language, facial expression, and other subconscious cues. 
Despite the widespread use of masks in the Shadowlands, your 
ability to give and receive impressions is unhampered, for it is 
not just the face that communicates.

Specialties:  Dignified,  Stunning,  Honest-Looking,  Gor-

geous, Noble, Sexy, Pleasing, Handsome, Luminous

Poor: You were the “before” picture in many ads.
Average: A face in the crowd.

Good: Reasonably attractive.

••• 
••••  Exceptional: You turned heads everywhere you went.
•••••  Outstanding: A face and physique for the ages.

Mental Attributes

Mental  Attributes  relate  to  a  wraith’s  mental  capacity: 
memory, perception, thoughts, and base knowledge. They de-
tail how fast he can think, how much he can think about, and 
whether he knows what he should be thinking about.
Perception

Perception determines how much you notice of the world 
(or the Underworld) around you. Your Perception rating de-
scribes how well you pick up incidental details, how much you 
actually garner from conversations with others, and how much 
more beyond the obvious you are generally aware of.

Specialties: Insightful, Attentive, Probing, Patient, Detail-

Oriented, Astute, Observant, Clueful
• 
•• 

Poor: You often walked into trees.
Average:  You  were  aware  of  the  basics  of  your  sur-
roundings.
Good: You could find subtext in advertising and novels.

••• 
••••  Exceptional: The smallest details caught your eye.
•••••  Outstanding: Needles? Haystacks? Child’s play.
Intelligence

Intelligence is the sum of both your knowledge and your 
ability to reach new conclusions. It is your ability to take discrete 
pieces of information and fit them together into a coherent 
whole, as well as a measure of how complex the ideas you can 
comprehend might be. Intelligence is not a measure of how 
fast you think, but rather how well you think and, to a lesser 
extent, what you already know.

Specialties: Knowledgeable, Smart, Bookworm, Researcher, 

Clear Thinker, Astute, Pragmatic, Obsessive Fan
• 
•• 

Poor: Adding numbers higher than 10 was difficult.
Average: You could count your change and know if 
you’d been ripped off.
••• 
Good: You could calculate tips in your head.
••••  Exceptional: Quantum physics and macroeconomic 

theory made sense to you.

•••••  Outstanding: An IQ of 200 — or more.
Wits

Wits  is  your  ability  to  react  to  the  information  that  is 
presented you. Essentially, your Wits Attribute determines how 
well you think on your feet, how fast you can use the informa-
tion you process, and how efficient you’re likely to be under 
stress. It also includes, to a degree, humor, and could well be 
described as the “processor speed of the brain.”

Abilities
Talents

trictly untrained and intuitive, Talents are 
the things you have a knack for from the day 
you are born. Most Talents can’t be picked 
up through training (though Brawl and a few 
others are exceptions), only through direct 
experience and native-born ability. There’s 
no penalty for trying a roll on a Talent you 
don’t possess, as these Abilities are so natural that everyone has 
at least a very basic idea of how to perform them.
Alertness

This Ability displays how aware you are of your physical 
surroundings. It has nothing to do with eerie feelings or the 
supernatural; it’s just a measure of knowing what’s physically 
out there. Alertness extends to sounds, smells, and touches as 
well as sights. A wraith has the option of hyperattenuating her 
senses at will, and sometimes this requires a roll of Perception 
+ Alertness to see things in the Skinlands.

Awareness

Awareness is the psychic equivalent of Alertness. With Aware-
ness, you instantly notice when things are not as they should be. 
This is useful in detecting evidence of Arcanoi or Spectres, seeing 
if other supernatural beings have been about, and sensing when 
something contrary to the laws of nature is about to happen.

Brawl is the gentle art of hitting something and watching 
it fall down. It serves as a catchall term for any form of unarmed 
combat, from martial arts to two drunks blindly wrestling on 
a pool table. This Ability covers everything from haymakers 
to eye gouging to spinning side kicks, pretty much any combat 
maneuver that doesn’t require a weapon. Brawls are generally less 
lethal than armed combat, but this Talent can be quite deadly.

This Talent is related to sensing and understanding what

others,  but  you  do  get  an  accurate  reading  of  what  they  are 
really feeling. Empathy is also useful in allowing you to get a 
general feel for your surroundings, and whether the vibes in an 
area are good, bad, or indifferent.

Intimidation

Intimidation allows you to gently — or not so gently — 
coerce another into doing your will. Uses of Intimidation range 
from subtle threats to making examples to causing severe physi-
cal pain, and each of these techniques has a time and a place. 
Wraiths with a high level of Intimidation can cow others with

Persuasion is the knack for talking someone into something, 
whether it’s in their best interest or not. A wraith with Persuasion 
can make a bad idea sound like a good one, or vice versa, depend-
ing on which side of the argument she takes. The truth, such as it 
is, is irrelevant when Persuasion is in play. All that matters is the 
presentation of the argument. This can be gently done or a high-
volume approach. The details are up to each individual wraith.

On the streets, everything — from Soulfire crystals to gossip

an understanding of slang and street customs, as well as an instinc-
tive way of fitting in. Wraiths without Streetwise who attempt to 
enter the scene are easily identified as being out of their element; 
wraiths who do have Streetwise are given an automatic sense of 
belonging. Bear in mind that not every scene is the same, and that 
a wraith who fits in one place may be a fish out of water in another.

Skills

Skills are Abilities that can be acquired through rigorous 
training or apprenticeship. Part intuition, part learned informa-
tion, Skills are equal parts talent and training. If you attempt to 
make a Skill roll relating to a Skill in which you have a rating 
of zero, the difficulty for that roll is increased by 1, to reflect 
the fact that you don’t have more than a vague idea of what 
you’re doing.
Crafts

Crafts involves taking raw materials and building something 
useful from them. It refers to the skills of master artisans — gem 
cutting, glassblowing, leatherworking, woodworking, smithing, 
etc. The number of successes on a Crafts roll indicates how 
well-made the object in question is.

Etiquette is the measure of your understanding of the nu-

during diplomatic engagements, gatherings, or encounters with 
higher society. It’s also helpful in figuring out how to interact 
with centuries-old wraiths on the isle as opposed to fresh Enfants 
in the streets of the local Necropolis, and even understanding 
the social mores of the Labyrinth. After all, Etiquette isn’t just 
knowing how to be polite, it’s also sometimes knowing how to

particularly as regards to the disposition of property. It covers 
all the basics of theft and acquisition, from pickpocketing to 
safecracking  to  knowing  how  to  fence  stolen  goods  without 
bringing the heat down on your head immediately. Sleight of 
hand and the ability to misdirect are equally important aspects of 
Larceny, which can be used for anything from filching a wraith’s 
Fetter to looting a shrine in the heart of the Labyrinth. Larceny 
also lets a wraith recognize cons for what they are, making it 
equally helpful for those on the right side of the law.

Knowledges

Soulforging, Survival, Cooking, Boating, Archery, Disguise, 

Other Weapons (Heavy, Ancient, Medieval)

Knowledges  are  those  Abilities  dependent  upon  rigorous 
application of the mind. There may be a physical element to 
their  use,  but  the  key  component  is  acquiring,  assessing,  and 
using information. Knowledges can be learned inside or outside 
of a classroom, but study at them is necessary. Learning from 
someone (like a Mentor or a fellow player character) is the best 
way  to  acquire  a  Knowledge,  but  there  are  many  self-taught 
wraiths. Without a Knowledge in a specific field, you may not 
even attempt to make a roll relating to that Knowledge. The only 
exceptions are when the roll in question refers to trivial knowledge 
that any wraith might know, or when special circumstances arise.
Academics

The Academics Knowledge represents the character’s educa-
tion in the humanities: literature, history, art, philosophy, linguistics, 
and other subjects normally encompassed under the banner of 
“liberal arts.” A high Academics rating indicates a well-rounded 
knowledge in many of these fields, along with expertise in one in 
particular. This can be useful to a wraith in multiple ways, whether 
she’s poring through the centuries of Stygian archives or meeting 
the wraith of the 14th century king she did her thesis on. A player

THE LANGUAGE OF THE DEAD

It  has  been  said,  not  without  some  irony, 
that  death  is  the  universal  language.  Except, 
of course, it happens to be true. Regardless of a 
wraith’s native tongue, once they cross over to the 
Shadowlands, she’s able to understand and speak 
with any wraiths she encounters. The same holds 
for written language; the records of the dead are 
kept in a script that is understood by all. Some 
theorize this is due to death’s winnowing effect, 
while others chalk it up to a miracle created by 
Charon or the Lady of Fate. Regardless, all of the 
citizens of Stygia can in fact communicate with 
each other easily and directly. 

That doesn’t mean that a wraith’s language 
skills  evaporate  when  she  crosses  the  Shroud. 
Other  wraiths  may  speak  the  language  of  the 
dead, but interactions with mortals still require 
an understanding of the tongue they’re speaking 
in, and written documents remain in their native 
languages even when read by the Restless. As a 
result, more than one Renegade group has taken 
to communicating through Skinridden mortals 
penning notes in obscure mortal languages, the 
better to frustrate the spying eyes of the Legions.

to protect a living Fetter, while an appreciation of physiology 
could combine with Outrage to produce some devastating results.

Backgrounds are Traits that lie beyond the direct physical 
and supernatural capabilities of a given wraith. They help define 
a character’s history and context, and you should choose them 
to enhance and solidify your wraith’s personality and history. 
Backgrounds can also complement each other, and the suite 
of Backgrounds chosen reveals a great deal about a character. 
Characters with a lot of Allies but few Contacts are completely 
different from characters with few Allies but loads of Contacts, 
though they may know the same number of wraiths. The for-

140

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

mer has a great many wraiths upon whom she can rely on in a 
crunch, but few acquaintances; the latter knows wraiths who 
will converse with him, but who won’t back him up in a time 
of need. Often, a character’s Backgrounds, particularly those 
like Memoriam or Status, help define the limits of what a Sto-
ryteller character (or newly met player character) might know 
about a wraith upon first meeting her. With this in mind, it 
is vital to pick Backgrounds that work well with your wraith’s 
character concept.

Your  Storyteller  should  have  input  into  your  choice  of 
Backgrounds. For example, in a chronicle that begins with your 
character’s death (and subsequent rebirth in the Shadowlands), 
it  might  be  inappropriate  for  a  character  to  possess  certain 
Backgrounds — Mentor or Status, for example. Other chronicle 
concepts, such as a story in which the wraiths are agents of the 
Hierarchy,  might  require  that  the  characters  possess  at  least 
two  dots  in  each  of  these  Backgrounds.  Backgrounds  are  a 
good way for Storytellers to ensure that the characters devised 
by the players fit smoothly into the chronicle and work well 
together. A shared Mentor, for example, gives two wraiths a 
reason to know each other; a Contact shared across the entire 
group can bring the characters together if that wraith suddenly 
goes mysteriously missing.

On certain rolls, a Background can be combined with an 
appropriate Attribute. For example, your Storyteller might call 

for a Charisma + Allies roll to determine how many of your 
Allies rally to your current cause, or a Manipulation + Status 
roll to decide if you can bully a Centurion based on rank alone.
Be aware that Backgrounds are fluid things. You can purchase 
(or the Storyteller can award at their discretion) additional points 
in Backgrounds based on the action of the campaign. After all, 
new Allies and Contacts can be acquired, Artifacts and relics 
can be purchased or found, and Haunts can be settled. At the 
same time, a Haunt can be seized or destroyed, Artifacts can 
be stolen, and Mentors, Allies, and Contacts can be turned, 
captured, or taken out of commission. A Background is a start-
ing point, not an assured final destination.
Allies

Life  among  the  dead  is,  of  necessity,  bleak.  It  would  be 
bleaker still were it not for the tendency of wraiths to associ-
ate with one another and seek company and solace from their 
Restless colleagues. Creatures of passion, wraiths are prone to 
making and breaking strong and intense friendships with others 
in the Shadowlands. Such bonds are represented by the Allies 
Background. Allies need not be close friends (and should not 
include members of a wraith’s Circle), but may instead represent 
comrades in arms, likeminded individuals, fellow mourners, or 
any wraith (or other inhabitant of the wraith’s world) who has 
reason to feel kinship with the character.

TRAITS

141

Allies often aid a wraith when called upon, although like any 
friend they can become tired of repeated demands on their time 
and resources. Allies need to be maintained, and a wraith who 
takes but does not give is likely to find his Allies deserting him. 
Spending points on buying an Ally does not ensure the services 
of an infinitely tolerant, infinitely generous individual, but rather 
a relationship that must be tended in order to remain beneficial. 
After all, most Allies have needs of their own, and a wraith may 
find himself being called upon to help his friend in her time of need.
The Storyteller and player should cooperate in detailing 
specific Ally characters, and many stories can develop from the 
relationship between a wraith and his Allies.
None:  A character with no Allies is unusual, and you should 
decide what it is about your character that drives others 
away.
A single Ally, probably highly valued for her uniqueness.
Two Allies; are they jealous of each other?
Three Allies; one may be special in some way.

• 
•• 
••• 
••••  Four Allies; do your Allies know of each other’s existence?

Artifact

Commonly fueled by Pathos, Artifacts have certain func-
tions or powers that aid the wraiths (most often the servants of 
the Hierarchy) who carry them. Artifacts are highly valuable, 

and greedily hoarded by the authorities. Any wraith who chooses 
the Artifact Background must create (in conjunction with the 
Storyteller) a story explaining reasonably where she obtained 
the Artifact, and why she has been allowed to keep it. This is 
particularly tricky for wraiths who have just been Reaped. If a 
player wants an Artifact for such a character, it’s up to her and 
the Storyteller to either come up with a very good explana-
tion for how this happened or set up a way for the character to 
obtain the Artifact at an appropriate moment during gameplay. 
Characters who take this Background can purchase it more 
than once, with each purchase representing one Artifact of the ap-
propriate level. Conversely, multiple points spent on Artifacts can 
instead grant a character a single more valuable and potent item.
None:  Like  most  wraiths,  the  character  has  acquired  no 
Artifacts. Maybe it’s lack of interest, maybe it’s lack 
of funds, maybe it’s lack of opportunity.
A seemingly insignificant Artifact.
A minor Artifact, such as a compass that always points 
to Stygia.

An Artifact of some purpose, like a sword of Stygian steel.

need relic bullets).

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Contacts

Distinct  from  Allies,  Contacts  are  people  (or  wraiths) 
whom the character has encountered and who are willing to 
work with him. They are individuals who are prepared to do the 
character a favor, or furnish him with information or aid, but 
in general they have a price. That price may be as simple as a 
promise of a later favor, as complicated as a political maneuver 
or as base as a financial debt, but it generally matches the value 
of the service rendered.

A  wraith’s  Contacts  score  represents  two  things:  major 
Contacts and minor ones. Major Contacts are the individuals, 
detailed by the Storyteller and/or the player, with access to the 
services and information that the player desires. These can be 
wraiths in the Shadowlands, Spectres in the Tempest, or living 
people from the character’s time among the Quick, but all will 
recognize her and should be willing to cut some kind of deal. 
There are also minor Contacts, who specialize in the same general 
field of influence as the major Contacts. These individuals can 
prove useful to a wraith if a successful roll against her Contacts 
rating (difficulty 7) is made, but minor Contacts are generally 
less informed, less helpful, and less friendly than major ones.
None:  No useful Contacts. However, perhaps you are a Con-

One major Contact and few others. You probably have 
a special arrangement with this Contact.

Three  major  Contacts  and  a  fair  helping  of  minor

••••  Four major Contacts, all in different areas, although 
you  could  double  up  and  cover  one  particular  field 
completely.

•••••  Five major Contacts and an associated minor Contact 

on almost every street corner.

Eidolon

Eidolon is a measure of spiritual fortitude. It is an indication 
of special potential in a particular wraith to resist the temptations, 
assaults, and insults of the Shadow. While it does not necessarily 
suggest that a wraith is objectively good or even moral, it does 
reveal a wholesome knack for metaphysical resistance. Eidolon 
is tied to a wraith’s Psyche, and some Eidolons are so strong as to 
manifest occasionally as a separate entity, much like the Shadow 
does. Most, however, are firmly integrated into a wraith’s Psyche. 
A wraith with a high Eidolon rating does not necessarily possess 
special insight into the workings of her Shadow (although she 
may), but may instead have some special ability to stave off the 
Shadow’s attempts to drag her to Oblivion.

Each point of Eidolon represents one extra die per session 
that  a  player  can  add  to  any  roll  which  resists  some  intent, 
plan, or ploy of his Shadow (including the Shadow’s Thorns). 
A player may use one, some, or all of his Eidolon dice in any 
roll but not more than his total Eidolon rating each session. 

Eidolon can also be used during a Harrowing to exercise some 
control over the course of events.
None:  Like most of the Restless, you face your Shadow alone.

You can sometimes second guess your Shadow.

•••••  Your  Shadow  must  choose  its  moment  carefully  or 

waste all its efforts.

Haunt

It’s not an accident that ghost stories refer to the tendency 
of spirits to inhabit certain buildings, crossroads, or other lo-
cations. Wraiths are often tied to a spot in the Shadowlands 
that corresponds to a place of special import for them in the 
Skinlands. In these places, the Shroud wears thin and a wraith 
can establish a Haunt, which serves as home, sanctuary, and 
refuge. When in her Haunt, a wraith can employ Arcanoi more 
easily and confront her Shadow in privacy and with confidence. 
Wraiths can Slumber in their Haunts, and many also fortify them 
as refuges against Maelstroms and other spectral incursions.

Sometimes  Haunts  are  shared  between  several  wraiths,  but 
these groups are invariably small, as the trust involved in sharing the 
privacy of a Haunt is seldom found in the Shadowlands. Haunts are 
usually tied to a single physical place, and the corresponding Skin-
lands location is often run down and decayed. A Haunt, if belonging 
to a single wraith, is often connected with a particular Passion or 
Fetter, and a Haunt which is itself a Fetter is both rare and potent.
The local Shroud rating is lowered by the Haunt’s rating 
inside the Haunt itself, and many Haunts also gather Memoriam, 
which is available to any wraith who spends time there. At the 
Storyteller’s discretion, players can combine their Background 
points to purchase a shared Haunt. The details of such a place 
are left to the Storyteller to determine. Other wraiths may wish 
to have both communal and private Haunts. In this case, the 
Background must be purchased twice, once for each type of Haunt.
None:  You have no Haunt and probably Slumber on the run. 
Are you a nomad by choice or circumstance?
A small domicile, perhaps a closet or phone booth.
A Haunt large enough for you to survive in, but hardly 
luxurious.
A fair-sized Haunt, which can accommodate you and

of many powerful wraiths not blessed with such a home 
themselves.

TRAITS

143

Legacy

It might be the desire of every living person to be remem-
bered, but human memories are the very lifeblood of wraiths. 
Some individuals are remembered by few, some by many (this 
is covered by the Background Memoriam), but there are cases 
where a wraith’s works are remembered long after her name 
has been forgotten. The Legacy Background covers this sort of 
memory, representing a wraith’s creations that have lived on 
after her death. A Legacy can represent a variety of different 
things, from hard objects — buildings, statues, 1,000 planted 
trees — to less tangible things such as an art collection, a politi-
cal theory, or a word that has become common usage.

Once per story, a wraith can try to gain focus and comfort 
from her Legacy. To do so, the wraith must travel to the site of 
the Legacy (or some important place associated with it in the 
case of intangible Legacies) and roll a number of dice equal 
to the level of the Background (difficulty 7). The number of 
successes represents the number of levels of damage the wraith 
can heal. Normal damage is regenerated instantly; aggravated 
damage  takes  approximately  one  hour  of  attendance  upon 
the Legacy per Corpus Level healed. This represents a process 
of  confirmation  and  affirmation  for  the  wraith,  the  physical 
manifestation of which is healed Corpus.
None:  No trace remains that you ever lived.
• 

A painting of yours hangs somewhere on the wall of 
an obscure gallery.
You funded a building on a college campus.
You reseeded a devastated forest area through which 
people pass every day.

••• 

••••  You designed the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty.
•••••  An important idea in modern life is attributed to you. 
Perhaps you founded a religion or a political move-
ment, or created a popular social media app.

Mentor

The relationship between a character and his Mentor is 
different from that between a character and either an Ally or a 
Contact. A Mentor is sometimes a patron, sometimes a teacher, 
sometimes a protector, and sometimes all of these things. While 
a Mentor will not always respond to requests for help from a 
wraith, she always acts in what she believes are the wraith’s best 
interests (though the wraith might see things differently). A 
wraith’s relationship with her Mentor is complicated and per-
sonal, and should be the subject of detailed roleplaying. Such 
a relationship is not usually an even or casual one, and entails 
responsibilities on both sides.

Some Mentors teach Arcanoi to wraiths in their charge, 
but always the Mentor chooses what is taught and what is not. 
A Mentor may do more than teach Arcanoi — perhaps they 
serve as an advocate for the character in Stygia, perhaps they 
teach new Abilities, or perhaps they even physically bail the 
wraith out of trouble.

None:  Perhaps you have a problem with authority, or you 

• 

seek a master worthy of your attention.
A Mentor little older than yourself, but with a few 
connections.
A Mentor of some importance, but little power.
An old and wise Mentor, with a modicum of clout.

•• 
••• 
••••  A politically powerful Mentor who can pull strings 
on your behalf and teach you many secrets.
•••••  An almost omniscient Mentor, perhaps a Ferryman 

or a high-ranking Hierarch.

Memoriam

The essence of the dead is hard to define, but Pathos stems 
directly  from  emotion,  and  the  emotion  that  the  living  feel 
for the dead is expressed as memory. After all, memory is the 
way in which the living interact with the dead. People have a 
tendency to remember those who are lost in strange ways, or 
to project thoughts and feeling onto those who are no longer 
there to represent themselves.

Some wraiths can take comfort from the fact that they are 
remembered by many people (though not necessarily fondly). 
Others  are  recalled  by  few,  one,  or  even  none.  There  is  an 
argument among the dead as to whether it is better for one 
person to remember you well than for an entire nation to recall 
your life with hate, envy, or resentment. However, Memoriam 
makes no judgments.

Memoriam allows the wraith to access extra Pathos. By 
invoking the feelings the living have for her, once per session 
a wraith can roll her Memoriam rating (difficulty 8), with each 
success granting one point of Pathos. If a botch is rolled, one 
point of Memoriam is permanently lost, as the inevitable process 
of forgetfulness and myth obscures memories of the wraith.
None:  You lived and died alone. Few, if any, even remember 
your name. Alternatively, you lived so long ago that 
all memories of you have faded.
One person remembers you. Perhaps you have a roadside 
memorial somewhere.
A handful of people remember you on occasion.
A stretch of highway is named after you, or perhaps a 
beloved local park.

•• 
••• 

• 

••••  A community, organization, or company has you on 

its roll of honor — or curses your name.

•••••  You have legendary status in an entire nation (or more). 
This level of recognition is far easier to achieve in a 
negative light than in a positive.

Notoriety

Fame is an important issue for most of the living occupants 
of the western world. Those who are not actively pursuing or 
attempting to preserve it are constantly bombarded with im-
ages of those who are. Among the dead, mortal fame has little 
impact, though there are those who die with such a reputation 
that the Restless await them.

144

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

However, it is also possible to cultivate a reputation, good 
or bad, beyond the grave. Renegades and other dissidents soon 
earn themselves reputations, and not ones to be envied. Notoriety 
is a measure of how well a wraith is known, how much he is 
talked about, and what expectations other wraiths have of him. 
There are some benefits to Notoriety — some wraiths will flock 
to attach themselves to a notorious figure, while others will flee 
or do whatever the wraith asks out of fear. At the same time, 
a wraith with a high rating in Notoriety may find that it can 
be a curse — other wraiths talk about him a great deal, project 
hopes and grievances onto him and demand favors and attention 
simply by virtue of his role as a public figure. Fame in life does 
not guarantee Notoriety after death, nor does a quiet and low 
profile life preclude a rise to prominence in the Shadowlands.
None:  Like most of the Restless, you are a face in the crowd. 

Do you deliberately keep a low profile?
You have made some impressions.
• 
Perhaps your Haunt is visited regularly.
•• 
••• 
Your name has traveled farther than you have.
••••  Every wraith in the Shadowlands recognizes your name 

(but not necessarily your face).

•••••  For whatever reason, you cannot escape being recog-

nized everywhere you go.

Relic

Relics are things that once existed in the Skinlands, and 
that persisted in the Shadowlands after their destruction. The 
reasons for this psychic durability vary, but all invoked strong 
enough emotions while they existed to cross the Shroud on the 
strength of those memories. Some relics were important things 
in  themselves,  such  as  national  treasures  or  badges  of  office. 
Others were articles that were acutely important to one person 
and acquired enough emotional weight from that individual to 
persist in the Shadowlands — wedding bands, stuffed animals 
and the like. A relic need not have belonged to the wraith in life 
or even to have had some great significance to her; property can 
be acquired by the Restless as well, and there is a huge market 
in buying, selling, and scavenging relics across the Underworld.
Characters  who  take  this  Background  can  purchase  it 
more than once with each purchase representing one relic of 
the appropriate level.
None:  You  have  nothing.  Are  you  a  recent  escapee  from 

Thralldom, or just not attached to material things?

••• 
A relic with some usefulness, such as a telescope or knife.
••••  A major relic with moving parts, often powered by Pathos.
•••••  A huge or invaluable relic, a sophisticated device or

Status

Status is a more concrete recognition of power than No-
toriety. It does not, however, measure actual worth or achieve-
ment. Many in the bureaucracies of the Underworld, just as 
in the Skinlands, have done little, if anything, to deserve the 
authority they have; they have simply accrued it over the years, 
and now wield it. Status can also be used to gain favors from 
authorities, of whatever kind. 

Status does not necessarily relate to the Hierarchy, although 
most Hierarchy members possess at least some Status. It can also 
represent a ranking in a Renegade band, a Heretic cult, or one of 
the many Guilds. It is possible, though uncommon, for a wraith to 
possess Status in several groups. In this case, the Background must 
be purchased multiple times. With Status comes duty and respon-
sibility, and wraiths with high Status find themselves responsible 
for decisions which affect the existence of many lesser Restless.

Arcanoi

he  Underworld’s  rules  are  vastly  different 
from  the  Skinlands’.  The  realms  of  the 
dead  have  metaphysics,  not  physics,  and 
the forms and minds of wraiths are equally 
alien to the comfortable fixed reality of the 
Quick. Wraiths who can come to grips with 
these differences learn the focus and insight 
necessary to evoke changes in the world around themselves. 
Initially,  such  workings  were  unique,  spontaneous  efforts  of 
will, usually in Pathos-fueled moments of desperation. Over 

the millennia, though, dedicated wraithly innovators learned 
to  replicate  these  manifestations,  eventually  refining  their 
observations into the powers known as Arcanoi.

A wraith can learn Arcanoi from other Restless, rediscover 
them through study and experimentation, spontaneously mani-
fest them in moments of great emotional upheaval, or even 
acquire them from her Shadow. Each Arcanos is a method of 
using the wraith’s force of will and spiritual energy to evoke a 
series of conceptually related effects. An Arcanos is a balance 
of philosophy and craft, with some leaning toward concrete, 
codified  skills  and  others  more  resembling  transcendental 
mysticism. Most wraiths demonstrate aptitude for a handful of 
Arcanoi shortly after their rebirth and quickly learn or manifest 
the elementary powers, or arts, of those Arcanoi. 

Learning Arcanoi

Each  Arcanos  art  has  a  rating  of  one  to  five  dots,  with 
higher-rated arts being costlier and more potent. Each Arcanos 
dot grants an associated common art, a widely-recognized mani-
festation of that Arcanos that is in widespread use throughout 
the Underworld. For example, upon learning Argos ••, a wraith 
can use the Weather Eye and Phantom Wings arts. When she 
acquires Argos •••, she gains access to the Flicker art as well.
Many different narrative paths can lead to a new dot in an 
Arcanos. The normal experience-point costs for Arcanoi reflect 

OPTIONAL RULE: TRADING ARCANOI

If the Storyteller thinks it makes for a more 
interesting tale, characters can learn Arcanoi from 
one another, or from Storyteller characters, on a 
direct basis. A lesson in an art requires one con-
secutive day per dot of the art’s rating. In addition, 
the student’s player spends 1 Willpower per day 
and the teacher’s player makes a single Charisma 
+ Leadership roll (difficulty 6 for a common art, 
8 for an initiate art). With success, the student’s 
experience cost for the art is reduced by the teacher’s 
successes, to a minimum of one experience. This 
doesn’t stack with the rules for Guild instruction.

Yes, this option allows players to swap Arcanoi 
among  their  characters,  resulting  in  a  stronger 
Circle of wraiths. That’s okay. If the protagonists 
are  powerful,  the  Storyteller  can  throw  more 
difficult  challenges  at  them  with  a  reasonable 
expectation of not Harrowing the entire group.

Also,  if  you’ve  been  paying  attention  up 
to this point, you already know that solving a 
wraith’s real problems isn’t a matter of throwing 
around another cool special effect. Wraith is not 
a game whose foremost concern is adherence to 
an artificial power curve.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS

Each Guild has traditional allies. Over the centuries, these relationships have disseminated lesson plans 
and initiate arts outside the originating Guilds. Mechanically speaking, this means Status in a given guild 
also grants limited access to the Guild instruction and initiate arts of two other Guilds. The following table 
illustrates these relationships. When seeking Guild instruction in an allied Guild’s Arcanos, a wraith’s Status 
in the allied Guild is considered to be two dots lower than her actual Status in her own Guild. For example, 
a character with Status (Harbingers’ Guild) •••• is considered to have Status (Artificers’ Guild) •• and 
Status (Oracles’ Guild) •• only for the purpose of Guild instruction in Inhabit and Fatalism.

self-taught acquisition or ordinary tutelage from another Arca-
nos user. Mechanically, the player justifies the purchase to the 
Storyteller and pays the experience-point cost for the new dot.
On the character sheet, the circles for Arcanoi are bisected, 
unlike the circles for other traits. When the character learns a 
common art at a given Arcanos rating, the player fills in the left 
side of the circle. When the character learns an initiate art (see 
following), the player fills in the right side of the circle. Either side 
of the circle counts as a dot in the Arcanos for rules purposes, but 
having both sides filled in doesn’t grant any additional bonus. Nor 
does learning more than one initiate art at a given rating, if the 
Storyteller decides to create additional initiate arts.

Spontaneous Manifestation

Wraiths are creatures of passion. Strong emotion can alter their 
metaphysical being. Sometimes, this results in a character summon-
ing a hitherto-unknown Arcanos art in moments of desperation.

In game terms, a player can spend experience points during 
a scene to buy a new Arcanos dot. With Storyteller approval, the 
player spends Willpower equal to the art’s rating, then pays the 
full experience cost for the new dot. The wraith immediately 
gains the associated art — even an initiate art, if it’s appropriate 
to the character and the circumstances. This is best allowed 
sparingly, during climactic scenes, and at moments when the 
new art can tip the balance in the group’s favor.

Guild Instruction

Mastering an expression of will that warps the Underworld’s 
already-malleable reality is easier with a teacher. The Guilds are 
Stygia’s most prolific and systematic providers of Arcanos instruc-
tion. Over the centuries, they’ve developed training methods to 
streamline the instruction process while avoiding most of the 
potentially lethal errors that unskilled users of the arts can commit.
Guild instruction in common arts is available to any wraith 
with Status in the appropriate Guild. This process is automatic 

TRAITS

147

unless the Guild is locally persecuted or otherwise experienc-
ing severe turmoil, in which case the Storyteller may require a 
Charisma + Streetwise roll (difficulty 8) to locate a teacher. For 
any common art, Guild instruction takes one consecutive day 
per dot of the art’s rating, and the art’s experience point cost is 
reduced to current rating x2 experience (or a flat 5 experience for 
a new Arcanos). See p. 301 for the character-development rules.
Initiate arts (see following) are rare and carefully guarded, so 
the process is a bit more difficult. Locating a teacher always requires 
a Charisma + Streetwise roll (difficulty 8, or 10 if the Guild is under 
local threat). With success, the same experience-point cost reduc-
tion applies. A botch indicates the would-be student’s inquiries 
have brought some sort of trouble down on the Guild in question.

Initiate Arts

The common arts are taught across Stygia. Most students 
of  wraithly  powers  know  their  effects  and  signs,  at  least  in 
broad terms. However, these aren’t the only arts within each 
Arcanos. Each guild has its own array of secret lore, outgrowths 
of its signature Arcanos that it holds closely and teaches only 
to its members and most trusted allies. The collective term for 
these powers is initiate arts.

When a wraith gains a new dot in an Arcanos, she may 
learn that level’s initiate art in place of its common art if she 
has sufficient guild standing, as represented by her dots in Sta-
tus (appropriate guild). A wraith may learn initiate arts with 
a rating up to her corresponding Status rating. For example, a 
character with Status (Harbingers’ Guild) ••• may learn the 
initiate arts for Argos • through •••. Learning an initiate art 
doesn’t require instruction as described above, though it can 
reduce an initiate art’s experience cost.

An eligible character who already knows a common art 
for a given Arcanos rating may also learn the initiate art for 
the same rating or vice versa. This carries the same experience-
point cost as the original dot for that level of the Arcanos. For 
example, a character with Argos ••• who knows Wayfarer’s 
Resolve (the Argos •• initiate art) may learn Phantom Wings 
(the Argos •• common art) by paying the experience-point 
cost for the second dot of an Arcanos.

Technically, a character who knows an initiate art can teach 
it to anyone, regardless of Guild affiliation. Such transgressions 
have steep political costs for a Guildwraith, including revoca-
tion of Guild membership or worse.

148

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Guilds and Arcanoi

Each Guild has a chicken-and-egg relationship with its sig-
nature Arcanos. Some Arcanoi were the common elements that 
brought their corresponding Guilds together, while others arose 
from the collective workings of like-minded wraiths. In either 
case, the Guilds were once the sole source of Arcanoi, controlling 
not only their arts but the unique services those powers enabled.
Though the Guilds remain the unchallenged masters of the 
Arcanoi, their strict monopolies are long gone. Centuries of 
leaks, defections, and spontaneous rediscovery have spread the 
Arcanoi throughout the Underworld. Today, it’s a rare wraith 
who’s  been  active  for  more  than  a  decade  without  learning 
a few common arts of an Arcanos or two. However, initiate 
arts remain the guilds’ jealously guarded purview — and, in 
some cases, are the secret weapons that made survival possible 
through centuries of Hierarchy persecution. The Guilds’ modern 
mystique is, in part, an outgrowth of the initiate arts’ cachet, 
and it provides leverage for recruiting and intimidation alike.
Despite  the  common  arts’  democratization,  the  Guild-
Arcanos  pairings  remain  entrenched  in  Imperial  culture.  A 
wraith  who  displays  Arcanos  proficiency  is  likely  to  be  ste-
reotyped with its Guild’s archetypal traits, even if she’s never 
met  a  Guildwraith.  Moreover,  the  Stygian  vernacular  freely 
interchanges Guild monikers to mean both “member of a Guild” 
and “wraith who knows that Guild’s Arcanos.” Thus, all Argos 
practitioners are termed Harbingers, regardless of membership.

Guildmarks

Practicing each Arcanos causes the wraith’s Corpus to manifest 
guildmarks: permanent changes to their appearance or behavior 
that stem from use of those arts. As with the Arcanoi themselves, 
guildmarks once were badges of Guild membership. The spread of 
common arts means many wraiths on a citadel’s streets now bear 
at least superficial guildmarks. The Arcanos itself, not any sort of 
Guild affiliation or initiation, is what creates these marks.

Typically, a wraith begins to manifest guildmarks when she 
learns the second dot of an Arcanos, and fully develops them 
at the third or fourth dot. A wraith with such proficiency in 
multiple  Arcanoi  displays  all  their  guildmarks.  If  two  guild-
marks conflict, the Arcanos the wraith uses more often tends 
to dominate, though evidence of the less-favored Arcanos ap-
pears as well. For example, a Harbinger with some knowledge of 
Intimation has the jet-black eyes associated with Argos, though 
Intimation’s green glitter dances in her left eye’s inky depths.

Wielding Arcanoi

Using an art involves pairing its rating with an Attribute’s. 
For example, an art’s dice pool may be Perception + Lifeweb or 
Strength + Inhabit. Most arts also require the wraith to expend 
temporary Pathos, and a few exact an additional toll of Corpus or 
Willpower. Some arts, particularly those that coerce or destroy, 
also allow the user’s Shadow to batten on temporary Angst. 
Each art’s rules give its specific dice pool and costs.

The  local  environment  affects  most  Arcanoi.  The  Shroud, 
the barrier between the local Skinlands and Shadowlands, impedes 
wraithly power. Even when a manifestation is confined to the Un-
derworld, a strong local Shroud still impedes any attempt to change 
reality. For many arts, the difficulty of rolls to invoke effects across the 
Shroud is equal to the local Shroud rating. Unless the specific rules 
for an Arcanos or art state otherwise, this is the default difficulty to 
use any art. See p. 284 for typical Shroud ratings in different locales.
No effect may ever reduce an art’s difficulty below 4.

Rattling the Chains

As part of a wraith’s relationship to the lands of the Quick, a 
Fetter can ease attempts to affect the living world. If a Fetter is central 
to an Arcanos use (usually as the target), it can reduce the difficulty. 
At the Storyteller’s discretion, the player may roll the Fetter’s rating 
(difficulty 6), with each success reducing the art’s difficulty by 1. 
Alternately, the Storyteller may reduce the art’s difficulty by 1 or 2, 
depending on the Fetter’s importance to the character and the scene.
Attunement and Consorts

Attunement is a long-term process of repeatedly applying Ar-
canoi to a certain subject, investing effort to harmonize the wraith’s 
energies and the target’s being. This most commonly occurs through 
Embody, Inhabit, and Puppetry, though other Arcanoi may benefit, 
too. People to whom a wraith is attuned are called Consorts.

Each time a wraith successfully manifests to, Skinrides, or 
inserts herself into a being or object, the player may spend 1 
Willpower (not more than once per scene). The closer the wraith 
was to the subject in life, the easier attunement is. Attuning 
to a stranger costs 5 Willpower over time, while attuning to a 
close friend or lover may require only 2 or 3. 

Attunement’s benefits vary by Arcanos. Some arts are us-
able only on Consorts, while others’ effects are enhanced when 
dealing with an attuned subject. If an art lists no benefits of 
attunement, the Storyteller should determine an appropriate 
benefit. Reduced difficulty is a good default.

A wraith may never be attuned to more objects or beings 
than her permanent Willpower. However, she is always considered 
attuned to her Fetters, and they don’t count against this limit.

ARCANOS OPTIMIZATION

The  dice  pool  for  each  art  is  Attribute  + 
Arcanos. All Arcanoi use only two Attributes. 
In most cases, these are Attributes from the same 
category: either Physical, Social, or Mental. 

Three Arcanoi depart from this rule by using at-
tributes drawn from different categories. These are the 
banned Arcanoi: Flux, Intimation, and Mnemosynis. 
Each of these still relies on only two Attributes, but 
then again, optimizing for use of a feared and outlawed 
set of powers should be a little more difficult.

Harbingers

he  Underworld’s  unsettled  spaces  are 
vast  and  hostile.  Spectres,  plasmics, 
Maelstroms, and stranger hazards threaten 
the unwary traveler. Subjective distance 
and protean terrain render cartography 
an exercise in futility. The only reliable 
method  of  navigation  through  the 

Kingdoms. Those of a more mercantile bent become traders or 
guides, moving wraiths and their goods throughout the Under-
world. All but the most cynical, however, adopt the sailor’s 
ethos of always aiding vessels in distress, adapting it to the 
Underworld. Many wraiths owe their continued existence to 
a Harbinger’s timely intervention. Stygian tradition holds 
that interfering with a Harbinger, particularly with one 

engaged on a mission of mercy, brings ill luck.

Tempest  is  Argos,  the  ancient  Arcanos  of  travel. 
Only  the  desperate  and  foolhardy  sail  the  sunless 
sea  without  a  Harbinger  guide,  whose  expertise 
can make the difference between a narrow escape 
and  an  unexplained  disappearance.  When 
unencumbered  by  companions,  a  traveler 
versed  in  Argos  can  evade  or  outrun  even 
the Tempest’s greatest dangers.

Guildmarks
As Argos affects the Tempest, so too 
does a bit of the Tempest soak into each 
Harbinger. A wraith skilled in these arts 
gradually develops jet-black eyes, and 
her clothing flutters in intangible winds 
that gust with her emotions.
The Guild

Harbingers’ Guild folklore holds that the 
Guild existed long before it became the dominant 
body of Argos practitioners. Its apocryphal founders 
were victims of the first shipwrecks who continued 
their seamanship after death. The tale’s accuracy is 
debatable, but the Harbingers have always been closely 
associated with mariners, and Guild culture shows heavy 
influence from maritime (and, later, aeronautical) customs.

In the Guild’s heyday, its members’ constant mo-
tion forestalled any attempt at rigid organization. 
Harbinger society was a loose meritocracy ranked 
by navigational prowess and deeds of exploration 
or rescue. What structure existed hinged on the 
Harbormasters, veteran Harbingers who re-
tired from travel to serve as Necropolis trade 
factors,  lighthouse  keepers,  shipwrights, 
weather forecasters, and occasional life-
boat captains. The Harbormasters also 
maintained the Harbingers’ relationship 
with  the  Hierarchy,  working  closely 
with the Stygian government but never 

becoming part of it.

Focused on the Tempest, the Harbingers 
had  few  conflicts  with  Charon’s  laws.  Any 
participation in the revolt was individual choice, 
not  Guild  mandate,  and  most  Harbormasters 
counseled early withdrawal. The Breaking had little 
impact on the Harbingers’ comings and goings or their 
roles in the Underworld. Most Harbormasters remained 
discreetly  in  place;  the  few  Necropoli  that  did  eject 

them quickly became Maelstrom-wracked backwaters.
Factions

Harbingers have always been travelers; their Arcanos’ 

very nature enables and sometimes seems to compel it. Some 
are messengers, vital in an environment where communication 
moves at the speed of travel. Others are explorers, plumbing 
the  Tempest’s  depths  or  seeking  the  farthest  shores  or  Dark 

Beyond the Harbormasters, the Guild’s internal divisions 
mark out the Harbingers’ trades and agendas. Circuit Riders 
travel  between  smaller  Necropoli,  either  alone  or  as  part  of 
like-minded Circles, providing skilled services that the Hier-
archy can’t or won’t. The Anemographers study the Tempest

and plumb the Underworld’s darkest recesses. Privateers enjoy a 
mixed reputation, capable of moving any sort of goods but also 
likely to flout Hierarchy law and common decency for the right 
price. By contrast, Emissaries cultivate an aura of incorruptibility, 
serving not only as messengers but as trusted mouthpieces for 
wraiths who can’t themselves travel to conduct critical business. 
The most-respected Harbingers, though, are those for whom 
patrolling the Tempest and rescuing distressed wraiths is not 
a duty but a calling — one which yields a complex and not 
always warm relationship with the Ferrymen.

Argos
Argos Systems

Unless otherwise specified, a wraith using an Argos art may 
apply it to additional voluntary traveling companions, provid-
ing the same benefits that she herself receives. All members of 
the group must hold hands. Each “passenger” who lacks Argos 
increases the difficulty of all associated rolls by 1 (maximum 
10). Any passenger who loses his connection to the wraith falls 
into the Tempest.

When the wraith uses any Argos art to travel to one of her 
Fetters, the difficulty of any associated rolls is reduced by the 
Fetter’s rating (minimum 4).
• Weather Eye (Common)

The wraith is constantly attuned to the Tempest’s local 
fluctuations. In addition to providing awareness of nearby 
events in the Tempest, this allows swift travel between two 
Shadowlands locations via momentary shortcuts through 
the storm.

System:  The  character  is  always  aware  of  current 
“weather”  conditions  in  the  Tempest.  Looking  into  the 
local Tempest requires a Perception + Argos roll (difficulty 
6). The number of successes determines the clarity with 

which the wraith perceives the Tempest.

When the wraith uses Tempest shortcuts to speed Shadow-
lands travel, the player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Perception + 
Argos (difficulty 6). Successes reduce travel times.
1 success 

Normal for the mode of travel (walking, driving, 
etc.) but without incident

2 successes  Three-quarters normal travel time
3 successes  One-half normal travel time
4 successes  One-quarter normal travel time 
5 successes  As 4 successes, but the wraith arrives at a dra-
matically appropriate moment, even if her arrival 
violates causality

• Enshroud (Initiate)

The wraith can manipulate the membrane between the 
Shadowlands and the Tempest, drawing the sunless sea over 
herself  for  concealment  or  plunging  herself  into  it  without 
entering a Nihil.

System: When the wraith attempts to enter the Tempest, 
the  player  rolls  Wits  +  Argos  (difficulty  7).  One  success  is 
enough to open a momentary portal, which irises shut as soon 
as the wraith slips through it.

To  use  the  Tempest  for  concealment,  the  player  spends 
1 Corpus and rolls Wits + Argos (difficulty 7). Each success 
adds one die to all Stealth dice pools for the rest of the scene.

TRAITS

151

•• Phantom Wings (Common)

This art enables the wraith to fly in both the Tempest and 
the Shadowlands. Unless aided by the Tempest’s winds (which 
carry their own hazards), flight isn’t particularly swift, but the 
added  mobility  can  be  convenient.  The  power’s  eponymous 
wings always assume the same appearance for a given wraith, 
and are translucent and insubstantial.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Wits + Argos 
(difficulty 6). Each success grants one turn of flight at any speed 
between a stationary hover and the character’s normal jogging 
speed. Tricky maneuvers or tight quarters may require a Dexter-
ity + Athletics roll at the Storyteller’s discretion.

In  the  Tempest,  the  wraith’s  maximum  speed  doubles, 
though she is still subject to any inclement weather. In a Mael-
strom, this factor increases by the storm’s force (e.g., a three-bell 
Maelstrom  multiplies  the  wraith’s  maximum  flight  speed  by 
five), though again, Phantom Wings provides no protection 
from the Maelstrom’s damaging effects. 
•• Wayfarer’s Resolve (Initiate)

Many wraiths find travel into the deeper Underworld con-
strained by the spiritual weight of their Fetters. This art frees its 
user to move between the Shadowlands and Tempest-bounded 
destinations without suffering this constraint.

System: The wraith ignores the difficulty penalties that 
normally apply outside the Shadowlands while she has unre-
solved Fetters. This art is always active, requires no roll, and 
can’t be shared.
••• Flicker (Common)

This art harnesses the Tempest’s natural currents, enabling 
rapid leaps to nearby destinations. A wraith using Flicker may 
appear to teleport, or may seem to be sucked into a spontane-
ously forming Nihil only to be ejected violently from another. 
While this effect resembles that of Enshroud, use of the lesser 
art is not necessary for Flicker.

System: The player selects a destination within (Percep-
tion x 100) yards, spends 1 Pathos, and rolls Wits + Argos (dif-
ficulty 7). Each success reduces travel time by one turn. If the 
destination is within the wraith’s line of sight and within one 
turn’s running movement, she teleports there instantaneously 
and this use of Flicker does not cost an action. 

While traveling via Flicker, the wraith is submerged in the 
Tempest. Characters in the Shadowlands can’t perceive or target 
her without using Weather Eye or another appropriate power.
••• Turn the Anemoi’s Wrath (Initiate)

Stories abound of Harbingers plummeting through the fury 
of a Maelstrom, untouched by its acidic rain and barrow-flame 
lightning, to succor travelers in need. Turn the Anemoi’s Wrath 
is the source of many of these stories, an art that makes the wraith 
nigh-invulnerable to the Underworld’s most savage weather.

System: The player spends 1 Corpus and rolls Perception + 
Argos (difficulty 8). For a number of scenes equal to the successes 
rolled, the wraith’s dots in Argos add to her soak pool against 
environmental  sources  and  Pandemonium  arts.  In  addition, 
while this art is active, the wraith can soak aggravated damage 
from these sources with her full soak dice pool.
•••• Stormreader (Common)

Superficially  similar  to  lesser  navigational  arts  but  far 
stronger, Stormreader gives the wraith an intuitive sense of the 
Tempest that enables her to navigate safely over vast expanses 
of the sunless sea. This art is the cornerstone of the Harbingers’ 
ancient  mastery  of  Underworld  travel,  allowing  journeys  in 
relative safety between destinations in the Tempest.

System: When the wraith begins a journey to or from a 
destination in the Tempest, the player spends 3 Pathos and rolls 
Perception + Argos (difficulty 8). Successes reduce travel times 
as  per  Weather  Eye.  Additionally,  successes  also  reduce  the 
effective level of any Maelstrom through which the character 
passes during the journey. 
•••• Tempest-Rider’s Canceleer (Initiate)

Infrequently  taught  in  recent  centuries  and  always  rare 
outside the Harbingers’ Guild, this martial transformation melds 
aerobatic flight and vicious scything attacks. When a wraith 
invokes  Tempest-Rider’s  Canceleer,  gleaming  black  metallic 
wings erupt from her back. Impossible to mistake for Phantom 
Wings, these are solid, knife-edged, and limned in cold fire.

System: The player spends 2 Pathos and 1 Corpus and rolls 
Wits + Argos (difficulty 7). Each success manifests the wings 
for one turn. The wraith can fly as per Phantom Wings, except 
her maximum flight speed is her running speed. In addition, 
her brawling attacks inflict Strength + 2 damage — bashing if 
she buffets her target, lethal if she slashes with the wings’ edges. 
Against Spectres and plasmics, slashes do aggravated damage.
Alternately, if the wraith neither flies nor attacks with the 
wings during her turn, she can mantle over adjacent characters 
to  block  incoming  attacks.  When  so  interposed,  the  wings 
provide  the  wraith  and  any  beneficiaries  with  armor  whose 
rating equals the wraith’s dots in Argos. While mantling, the 
character can use her hands normally — for example, to attack 
with a weapon. 

This art cannot be shared.

••••• Oubliette (Common)

Feared by all who’ve seen it in action, Oubliette is an art 
of unwilling travel. With a glance, its practitioner can open 
temporary Nihils directly beneath other wraiths, plunging them 
into the Tempest. Alternately, she can pin targets in place, pre-
venting them from escaping into other parts of the Underworld.
System: For either application of this art, the player spends 
3 Pathos and makes a resisted Wits + Argos roll against the 
target’s Strength + Athletics. The wraith also gains 1 Angst.

152

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

If the wraith successfully uses this art to cast her target into 
the Tempest, a small Nihil opens under his feet, sucks him in, 
and immediately closes. The victim suffers lethal damage equal 
to the wraith’s net successes. Once pulled into the Tempest, he 
may use all Arcanoi normally — though if he lacks Argos, getting 
out of the Tempest may be more of a problem than the damage. 
If  the  wraith  successfully  pins  her  target  in  place,  the 
victim may not move for one turn per net success. Nor may 
he use any powers that facilitate travel between or within the 
Tempest, Shadowlands, or Skinlands. The imprisoning wraith 
must maintain at least minimal concentration (–1 die penalty 
to all social and mental dice pools) to keep her victim in place, 
and may release her hold at any time. Other wraiths may target 
the pinned character with arts that affect or force travel — for 
instance, hurling him into the Tempest with another use of 
Oubliette. Success on any such invocation breaks the pin but 
does lethal damage equal to its net successes as the unfortunate 
soul is torn between two irresistible forces. 

This art cannot be shared.

••••• Maître après Dieu (Initiate)

This art has always been rare, due not to any Harbinger 
recalcitrance  but  because  of  its  limited  applicability.  With 
Maître après Dieu, a wraith can apply much of her command 
of Argos to a relic or Artifact vehicle. This, of course, requires 
the wraith to control and command such a vessel. If she does, 
even  the  unlikeliest  of  conveyances  can  sail,  soar,  or  speed 
across the Tempest itself.

System:  To  use  this  art,  a  wraith  must  be  at  the  helm, 
wheel, or other steering control of a vehicle. The player spends 
4  Pathos  and  2  Corpus;  no  roll  is  required.  As  long  as  the 
character remains aboard, in command, and in control of the 
vehicle, she may apply any other travel-related Argos art to 
the vehicle and all its occupants. All occupants are considered 
“passengers” of the Argos arts in use, but the Harbinger does 
not suffer increased difficulties for their presence.

Sharing this art is as impossible as it is unnecessary.

Pardoners

ll  wraiths  struggle  against  their  Shadows, 
but a select few — the Pardoners — carry 
the battle further. Masters of the Arcanos 
Castigate,  they  study  the  Shadow 
to  learn  what  drives  and  feeds  it  so 
they  can  weaken  it.  They  walk  a 
dangerous  path,  for  as  Nietzsche 

building, the lantern advertises a Pardoner’s services; carried by 
her it illuminates his way in the darkest of places. Each lantern’s 
unique to the Pardoner who owns it, for she creates it herself 
as part of his “apprenticeship” (or, more rarely, gets it from 
a master who knows her well), but most Pardoners favor 
traditional designs with baroque, macabre adornments. 
A Pardoner’s lantern usually produces a pale, ghostly 
glow, but may change color or intensity depending on 

the Pardoner’s mood or personality.

reminds us, those who fight monsters must take care 
not  to  become  monsters  themselves.  More  than 
one Pardoner has gone just one step too far and 
succumbed to his own Shadow, all his powers 
of no avail.

No  one  method  or  practice  defines 

Castigate.  Each  Pardoner  takes  his  own 
approach  to  studying,  confronting,  and 
hindering  the  Shadow:  introspective 
philosophy, violence and intimidation, 
self-flagellation,  meditation,  ritual, 
book  learning,  music,  or  ruthless 
logic. Perhaps the best-known tactic 
is the Devil’s Dialectic, a sort of dialogue/
negotiation/debate based on the Shadow’s 
Nature. This individualistic approach may 
affect not only which arts a Pardoner chooses 
to learn, but how those arts manifest, appear, or 
function. A Pardoner who Castigates a Shadow 
with excoriating sermons works differently from 
one who puts a wraith through shamanic ordeals 
of endurance or inflicts suffering with harsh inter-
rogation techniques.

The Guild

According  to  their  own  (contested)  his-
tories, there was a time, long ago, when no 
Pardoners existed. There were only Solici-
tors, or rather those wraiths whose practices 
would one day lead to the founding of that 
Guild. The earliest studies of Intima-
tion, the Arcanos that explores dark 
desire, inevitably led some wraiths to 
delve into the negative emotions that 
create a wraith’s Shadow.

Exploring  the  Shadow  and  what 
drives  it  became  the  primary  interest  of 
these proto-Pardoners. Eventually, new arts 
aimed  at  understanding  and  combating  the 
dark side of wraiths’ Psyches evolved from their 
work. Over the centuries they refined these powers 
until it became apparent they’d created an Arcanos 

separate from Intimation: Castigate.

Guildmarks
A Pardoner’s fingers have black stains from where he’s 
touched or grappled with the Shadow. As the Pardoner’s

The  proto-Pardoners’  work  did  not  meet  with 
universal approval. In fact, many Solicitors considered it 
dangerous and potentially destructive. Too many Pardon-
ers touched the Shadow too deeply and became tainted by 
it, making them a threat to everyone around them. But the 
nascent Pardoners provided valuable services as well, and for 
many of them the struggle against the Shadow rose almost to 
the level of a religious crusade.

154

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Eventually tensions with the Solicitors became too great 
— or so the Pardoners say. Adopting the iron lantern as their 
symbol because they “carried the Light against every Shadow,” 
the Pardoners broke from the Solicitors and formed their own 
Guild. At first other wraiths didn’t know what to make of them, 
and many looked on the Pardoners as some sort of Heretic cult. 
But Castigate helped other wraiths so much that Stygian 
society soon accepted the Pardoners on their own terms. 
Before long, the iron lantern hung

matter how small.

extensive records and libraries. The Simonists (who prefer the 
name Brokers) focus on the commercial possibilities of Castigate; 
as the name indicates, many in the Guild do not think highly 
of them. The Confessors, masters of the Devil’s Dialectic, can 
shame a Shadow into remorse with their arguments.

Castigate
Castigate Systems

When the Guilds revolt-
ed, the Pardoners joined, but 
without great zeal. Focused 
as always on their mission 
to fight the Shadow, they 
really  only  cared  about 
ending the Hierarchy’s op-
pression of Heretic groups. 
Even  when  Charon  broke 
the  Guilds,  he  did  little  to 
punish  the  Pardoners.  Without  their 
efforts,  Oblivion  would  long  ago  have 
overwhelmed  Stygia,  so  he  allowed 
them to go on conducting business as 
usual.  To  this  day  the  Hierarchy  and 
its Legions rarely trouble a Pardoner, 
and iron lanterns remain plainly vis-
ible wherever wraiths dwell. But the 
ancient discord between Pardoner and 
Solicitor remains, and neither Guild 
seems  interested  in  taking  steps  to 
resolve the problem. However, with the Solici-
tors regarded as terrifyingly dangerous outlaws 
and the Pardoners as vital members of Restless 
society, it’s clear whose side most wraiths take.

Factions
Although younger Pardoners often take a 
more psychological perspective on their Guild’s 
Arcanos  and  traditions,  many  Pardoners  re-
main steeped in the religious or quasi-mystical 
terms  and  concepts  that  have  characterized 
their  work  since  earliest  times.  This  extends 
to the names and roles of many of the factions 
within the Guild. The Crusaders, for example, 
take  the  hardest  line,  always  eager  to  pursue 
and combat Shadows, and often willing to use 
extreme methods that make even other Pardoners 
hesitate. The Scriveners, on the other hand, are 
the  most  studious  of  Pardoners.  They  fight  the 
Shadow  with  carefully  learned  lore  and  wise 
debate,  and  also  maintain  the  Pardoners’ 

Unless  noted  otherwise,  the 
difficulty  for  using  any  Castigate 
art on a Shadow is the Shadow’s 
permanent  Angst  score  or  the 
wraith’s  Willpower,  whichever’s 
higher.

Failed attempts at Castigation 
are  particularly  dangerous  for  the 
wraith  whose  Shadow  a  Pardoner 
has  confronted.  They  may  grant 
the Shadow one or more points of 
temporary Angst, make it easier for 
the Shadow to control the wraith in the 
future, or otherwise enhance the Shadow’s 

power in the short term.
• Soulsight (Common)

The most fundamental power of Castigate is 
to see the Shadow of another soul, and perhaps 
even gain understanding of it. A Pardoner can-
not use this art on herself.

System: With a successful Perception + 
Castigate roll, a Pardoner can sense the target’s 
Shadow.  The  more  successes  scored,  the  more 
details learned. One success indicates the Shadow’s 
Angst rating relative to the Pardoner’s (weaker, 
about equal, stronger) while five successes reveals 
the  Shadow’s  Archetype,  primary  Thorn,  and 
Dark Passions.
• Playing With Fire (Initiate)

A Pardoner tends to study her own Shadow 
a great deal, and thus learns ways to coax out its 
power with less risk to herself. Of course, less risk 
does not mean no risk.

System:  Whenever  the  Shadowguide  offers 
the player Shadow Dice to assist with a task (see 
page 235), the wraith may use Playing With Fire to 
add (or if he prefers, subtract) dice. The player rolls 
Charisma + Castigate (difficulty 6); every two full 
successes allows the player to add (or subtract) one die.
This  art  costs  no  Pathos.  If  the  player  fails  the 
roll, the wraith gains one point of temporary Angst.

TRAITS

155

•• Bulwark (Common)

A Pardoner’s knowledge of the Shadow allows her to shield 

herself and her companions from the effects of a Maelstrom.

System: To use this art, a wraith pays 1 Pathos per level of 
the Maelstrom. The player rolls Charisma + Castigate (difficulty 
of the Maelstrom’s level +3). If she succeeds, Bulwark shields her 
and anyone she touches from the force of the Maelstrom and 
hides them from nearby Spectres. In most cases, this conceal-
ment works automatically. If the Storyteller thinks a Spectre 
has a chance to see the Pardoner, the Pardoner receives a –1 
reduced difficulty on any Stealth or other roll she makes to hide 
from the Spectre per success she achieved on her Bulwark roll.
•• Catechize (Initiate)

Also known as Dark Secrets, Put To The Question, and In-
quisition, this art allows a Pardoner to learn a wraith’s deepest 
secrets by studying and questioning his Shadow. The Pardoner’s 
power forces the Shadow to divulge reliable information — but 
only a fool trusts a Shadow completely.

System: The wraith spends 1 Pathos, gains 1 temporary 
Angst, and closely examines the target wraith’s Shadow. (This 
requires a minimum of 1 turn, and possibly longer.) The player 
rolls  Charisma  +  Castigate  (difficulty  of  the  target  wraith’s 
Willpower). For each success achieved, the Pardoner may ask 
the Shadow one question. The character’s Shadowguide must 
provide a truthful response, but he can shade the truth, omit 
non-crucial  facts,  and  state  half-truths.  The  more  vague  or 
open to interpretation the question is, the greater the Shadow’s 
leeway to muddle the issue.

The target wraith may, if desired, allow his Shadow to make 
an Angst roll to resist the Pardoner’s Catechize roll — after all, 
not everyone wants to have their dirty laundry hung out for 
everyone to see. This causes the wraith to acquire 1 temporary 
Angst, though. If the Shadow controls the wraith, he always 
chooses to resist, but doesn’t acquire the 1 Angst.
••• Purify (Common)

The Pardoner focuses her power on another wraith’s Shadow 
to weaken it through purification — but the process injures the 
wraith. Different Pardoners use different methods to accomplish 
this.  The  most  common  include:  physical  torment;  rebukes, 
insults, sermons, or other speech; singing, dancing, and other 
performances; occult rituals; and religious chants/prayers. Any 
and all have been proven effective; it’s simply a matter of the 
Pardoner’s personal approach.

System: The player rolls the Pardoner’s Charisma + Casti-
gate (difficulty of the target wraith’s permanent Angst rating; the 
target wraith may spend Willpower to improve this roll). Each 
success reduces the Shadow’s temporary Angst by 1, but also 
causes 1 Corpus level of bashing damage to the target wraith. 
Furthermore, the Pardoner gains 1 temporary Angst for each 
“1” rolled on the Charisma + Castigate roll.

If Purify reduces a Shadow’s temporary Angst to zero, the 
targeted  wraith  gains  a  point  of  Willpower  and  his  Shadow 
goes quiet and listless until it is able to recover some Angst 
to refuel itself.
••• Trimming The Black Rose (Initiate)

This rare but potent art temporarily deprives a Shadow of 

one or more of its most dangerous weapons, its Thorns.

System: The wraith spends 2 Pathos and the player rolls 
Charisma  +  Castigate  (difficulty  of  the  target’s  Willpower). 
Each success means the Shadow loses the ability to use one of 
its Thorns for one turn. The Pardoner can use extra successes 
to extend the duration of Trimming as described below.

If the Pardoner knows two or more of the Shadow’s Thorns 
(either because she saw it use them, or via Soulsight or similar 
means), she may apportion the total turns of effect among them 
as desired. She may also use one success to extend the duration 
by one turn. For example, suppose she has four successes and 
knows the Shadow has Tainted Touch and Shadow Call. She 
could deprive the Shadow of the ability to use both Thorns for 
2 turns, or Tainted Touch for 3 turns and Shadow Call for 1 
turn, or any other combination that adds up to 4 turns. If she 
only knows one of the Shadow’s Thorns, she has to target that 
Thorn and can only use extra successes to extend the duration 
(if desired). If she doesn’t know any of the Shadow’s Thorns, 
the Storyteller determines which Thorns she affects, and for 
how long.
•••• Get Thee Hence (Common)

Just  as  a  Pardoner  can  use  her  own  purity  to  attack  a 
Shadow, she can raise it as a shield against Spectres, barring 
them from entering an area (or forcing them to leave an area 
they already occupy). She doesn’t have to know the Spectres 
are present to affect them, but for some reason this art doesn’t 
work against Doppelgangers.

System: The Pardoner defines the area she wishes to ward 
and then spends Pathos. The larger the area, the more Pathos 
required. One Pathos wards an area of up to 800 square feet; 
each additional 1 Pathos doubles the size of the area.

The player rolls Charisma + Castigate (difficulty 7); the 
ward lasts for a number of turns equal to the successes. Any 
Spectres  already  present  may  resist  by  rolling  their  current 
Angst, but unless they win the resisted roll they are forcibly 
expelled from the affected area. Spectres not already in the area 
have no chance to resist. No Spectres can enter the area until 
the ward falls, even if one or more other Spectres resisted the 
original effect and are already inside.
•••• Cooling The Blood (Initiate)

With  this  art,  a  Pardoner  can  temporarily  weaken  (or 
remove)  a  Shadow’s  Dark  Passions,  diminishing  the  fires  of 
cruelty that burn within its heart.

System: The wraith spends 1 Pathos and the player rolls 
Charisma + Castigate (difficulty 7). The target wraith may resist 

156

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

by rolling Willpower. The number of successes indicates two 
things: first, the duration of the effect in scenes; second, the 
number of points by which the Pardoner reduces one or more 
of the Shadow’s Dark Passions.

If the Pardoner knows what one or more of the Shadow’s 
Dark Passions are (typically by seeing them with Soulsight), 
he may choose to target those Dark Passions, or may let the 
Storyteller  determine  which  ones  are  affected.  The  current 
events of the chronicle may factor into this. For example, if 
the Shadow’s currently focusing on one of its Dark Passions, 
that one’s almost certainly going to be affected.

If one of the Shadow’s Dark Passions is reduced to zero 
this way, the Shadow loses 1 temporary Angst. If Cooling the 
Blood reduces all of them to zero, the Shadow loses 1 permanent 
Angst, to a minimum of 1.
••••• Defiance (Common)

The  height  of  the  Pardoner’s  art,  Defiance  allows  him 
to resist his Shadow’s attempt to take him over — or to help 
other wraiths do the same.

System: When the Pardoner’s Shadow attempts to gain control 
of her, she can fight it off by spending 1 Pathos, plus an additional 
1 Pathos for every success on the roll. The player rolls Charisma + 
Castigate (difficulty of the Pardoner’s current Angst); the Shadow 

has no way to resist. Each success reduces her temporary Angst by 
1. However, if the roll fails she gains 1 temporary Angst.

This art works the same when a Pardoner uses it to help 
a wraith other than herself, but this costs her 1 Willpower 
and the difficulty is the target wraith’s permanent Angst +3.
••••• Purge (Initiate)

Also known as Cathartic Reversal, this art gives a wraith 
dominated by his Shadow a chance to regain control of himself.
System: The Pardoner spends 2 Pathos and targets a wraith 
currently  undergoing  Catharsis  (see  p.  236).  The  player  rolls 
Charisma + Castigate (difficulty of the target’s Willpower). If 
he scores one or more successes, the Shadow and its wraith must 
engage in another Catharsis roll (which includes the Shadow 
having to spend another 1 temporary Angst; if it cannot do this, 
it automatically loses the roll). The wraith receives 1 additional 
success on his roll for every two successes the Pardoner scored on 
his Purge roll. If the wraith wins the contest, he retakes control of 
himself. If the Shadow wins, it remains in control, but the Purge 
strengthens the wraith’s Psyche — treat him as if he has one dot 
of Eidolon (or one additional dot) for the rest of the session.

Unless  the  Storyteller  rules  otherwise,  a  Pardoner  may 
not use this art on the same wraith more than once per scene.

TRAITS

157

Proctors

mbody is the art of physically manifesting 
in the mortal world. Such passage through 
the Shroud is among the most egregious 
violations of Charon’s law — at least, 
the letter of it. In practice, the ability 
to engage directly with the Quick is 
too useful to too many wraiths to 

stamp out entirely. Within the Hierarchy, all but the 
most hardline adherents to the Dictum Mortuum 
recognize  the  occasional  need  for  this  Arcanos 
and  grudgingly  tolerate  the  Proctors,  though 
these wraiths may suffer onerous sanction and 
scrutiny. Beyond the empire’s reach, masters 
of  Embody  are  in  high  demand,  for  what 
wraith doesn’t have occasional business 
on the far side of the Shroud?

Practical applications aren’t the 
only reason to use Embody. Putting on 
new (albeit temporary) flesh carries 
a  near-addictive  sensory  rush.  Each 
manifestation  renews  the  sensations 
that everyday wraithly existence damp-
ens.  For  every  wraith  who  pursues  this 
Arcanos to reconnect with a lost love or to 
influence events among the living, another 
seeks tutelage for the selfish pursuit of mortal 
experience.  Where  Embody  is  regulated,  such 
pleasure seeking assumes the cachet of forbidden 
vice, as much for its reputation as for its effects, and 
lessons in the art are integral to the local shadow (and 
sometimes Shadow) economy.

to drag herself into the Skinlands. Teachers of Embody tend to 
conduct lessons in the most chaotic locations available.

Guildmarks

The markings Embody leaves on Proctors reflect the 
foci the wraith use to materialize and the events she expe-
riences in the Skinlands. A wraith who prefers to focus 
on visual input might have eyes that reflect the other 
side of the Shroud, while one who seeks out sources 
of heat may develop blisters or a heat shimmer on 
his fingers. If Corpus loss while manifested forces 
the  wraith  into  a  Harrowing,  the  injury  that 
triggered the Harrowing often leaves a scar that 
even Moliate can’t erase. A savvy observer 
with  medical  or  supernatural  experience 
can tell the difference between ordinary 
scarring and that which Embody inflicts.
The Guild

Embody  and  the  wraiths  who 
would found the Proctors’ Guild arose 
together in Shroud’s earliest days. As the 
dead encountered growing difficulty with 
passage to the lands of the living, several 
groups approached the problem from different 
directions. The Proctors’ forerunners learned 
to subvert the Shroud through sensation, first 
extending  their  senses  across  the  Shroud,  then 

manifesting their own forms.

Embody is a difficult Arcanos to master, relying as 
it does on maintaining intense focus in the most chaotic 
surroundings.  Many  wraiths  preferred  commissioning 
Embodied  intercessors  to  learning  the  arts  themselves, 
particularly  for  a  task  among  the  Quick  that  needed  to 
be done immediately. Early Proctors saw this as a service 
model and seized the opportunity to establish a monopoly on 
Embody. While the Artificers have deeper history, the Proctors 

Embody  relies  on  sensory  input  from  across  the 

Shroud  as  an  anchor  to  which  the  wraith  draws  her 
consciousness. Emotional significance is secondary to raw 
intensity for this purpose. The din of a demolition site, the 
bustle of a neon-lit club district, or the noise and smoke of a 
natural disaster each resonates in the Shadowlands in its own 
way. An Embodying wraith follows this resonance to its source 

158

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

were the first Guild to take on the trappings of mortal trade associations and organize as a body of 
monopolistic service providers.

Since its inception, the Guild has struggled with the fundamental question of 
how best to use Embody. Business-minded Proctors argue for the traditional model 
of Skinlands services for hire, while idealists see a higher calling than pure com-
mercialism. A strong minority of Proctors reject both service-oriented 
perspectives, studying Embody simply to feel fleshly pleasures again. Few 
Proctors are neutral. Once experienced, Embody itself is a polarizing 
force, and the drive to feel its sensations again engenders myriad 
justifications for continued use.

Unsurprisingly, Stygian authorities saw Proctors as walking 
violations  of  Charon’s  will.  Unmonitored  use  of  Embody  was 
prohibited, though local authorities’ interpretation of acceptable 
practices varied widely. In more hardline Necropoli, the empire tried 
to establish a monopoly on the Arcanos, effectively subsuming the 
local Proctors into the Legions. Ironically, enforcing these policies 
fell to Legionnaires who also required proficiency in Embody to pursue 
offenders across the Shroud. Many of these wraiths developed Guild sympathies through 
their own Skinlands experiences, becoming de facto Proctors themselves.

After centuries of insult and repression, the Proctors were at the forefront of the 

War of the Guilds, striking viciously at their opponents’ Fetters and mortal resources. 
Stygian retribution was harsh; few senior Proctors escaped the forges. In the fol-
lowing centuries, the guild became less centralized, adopting a resistance cell-like 
structure  coordinated  through  mortal  contacts,  Skinlands  dead  drops,  and  other 
methods difficult to trace or interdict without Embody. As Stygian fervor has less-
ened in recent years, today’s Proctors have become slightly more open, but they 
still maintain a healthy distrust of anyone in a position of power who appears a 
little too understanding.

Factions
The Guild’s primary trade has always been in services performed across the 
Shroud. Simple manifestation is enough for a wraith to serve as another’s hands 
and voice. The Proctors distinguish themselves from lesser parties through their 
ability to provide specialists. The surest path to advancement within the Guild 
is to be able to apply a high-demand skill set to Skinlands objectives — whether 
that’s political manipulation, archaeological retrieval, or even removal of trouble-
some mortals. 

Within the Guild, Proctors tend to associate with similarly-skilled wraiths. The 
most notable such groups are Agents, who meddle in mortal politics and business, 
and Secretaries (as in “keepers of secrets”), who provide the Guild’s intelligence 
tradecraft and sometimes can be convinced to use it on others’ behalf. A rare few 
(and often short-lived) Boojums make a trade of turning the tables on ghost hunt-
ers. Proctors who join the Guild simply for personal gratification are Tasters, which is 
either a mild insult or a badge of honor, depending on one’s bent. Factors coordinate the 
Guild’s commercial endeavors as well as its quietly maintained Hierarchy relationships, 
and provide most of the structure for the Proctors’ overall organization.

Embody
Embody Systems

Unless otherwise stated, the difficulty of any Embody roll equals the local Shroud rating.
When using Embody in the presence of a consort (see “Attunement,” p. 149), the Proctor may 
draw on that attunement to ease his passage across the Shroud. This reduces the difficulty of all 
Embody-related rolls by 3 and the Pathos or Corpus cost of any power by 1 (if a power costs both 

TRAITS

159

Pathos and Corpus, only the Corpus cost is reduced). However, 
any use of Embody that leverages a consort is perceptible only 
to that mortal.

Once Embodied, a wraith experiences the full spectra of 
mortal sensation, but he’s also subject to the many dangers to 
which flesh is heir. When a Skinlands source inflicts injury on 
a physically manifested wraith, he suffers damage as if he were 
mortal, losing Corpus in place of health levels on a one-for-
one basis (rather than the fixed 1 Corpus he would have lost 
if immaterial).
• Whispers (Common)

The wraith may briefly whisper across the Shroud, making 

himself audible to listeners among the Quick.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Charisma + 
Embody. The Proctor may speak one short sentence per success 
(in combat, one turn per success).
• Maintain the Material Form (Initiate)

The Proctor can draw on his inner reserves to extend the 
duration of other Embody arts. This is physically and mentally 
taxing but most wraiths willingly pay the price to prolong their 
time among the Quick.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and 1 Corpus and rolls 
Manipulation + Embody. The difficulty increases by 1 for each 
time the wraith already has used this art in the current scene. 
Successes on this roll add to the successes previously rolled to 
activate one Embody art that the wraith is currently maintain-
ing. Maintain the Material Form does not cost an action and 
can be done at any time. 
•• Phantom (Common)

The wraith manifests as a hazy, translucent, and intangible 
apparition, only vaguely reminiscent of his mortal body. Mortals 
witnessing this manifestation react with fear and are subject 
to the Fog (p. 284).

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Charisma + 
Embody. The wraith manifests for one turn per success. While 
manifested, the character may take an action to induce fear in 
one observer, rolling Charisma + Intimidation (difficulty 7). 
Each success reduces the target’s Willpower by 1 for purposes 
of determining the Fog’s effects. At the Storyteller’s discretion, 
creative uses of other Arcanoi can reduce this roll’s difficulty.
•• Cache (Initiate)

For some Proctors, relics make easier first lessons than their 
own plasm. This art allows an object to pass momentarily across 
the Shroud. With effort, the wraith can extend the item’s stay in 
the Skinlands. In addition to the obvious communication with 
the Quick, this also enables the character to dump contraband 
for later retrieval, loan a relic to a mortal ally, or leave a secure 
message drop for another Proctor.

System: The player spends 2 Pathos and rolls Charisma + 
Embody. The relic passes into the Skinlands, where it remains 
for one minute per success. If the player spends 1 Corpus when 
activating Cache, this duration becomes one hour per success; 
for 3 Corpus, 1 day per success. The player may spend 1 Will-
power to end Cache prematurely, immediately returning the 
relic to the Shadowlands.

While a relic is in the Skinlands, it’s considered the same 
as any other material object for purposes of wraithly interaction. 
However, if the relic is destroyed while in the Skinlands, it im-
mediately falls into Oblivion and the wraith’s Shadow gains 2 
temporary Angst. Cache can’t be used on Artifacts or Moliated 
wraiths. Soulforged materials, however, can be affected.
••• Statue (Common)

With this art, the wraith can assume solid, albeit immobile, 
form. The Proctor can materialize as a cold, hard, idealized ver-
sion of his Corpus, a gory recreation of his mortal shell at the 
time of his death, a luminous apparition with blazing, accusatory 
eyes, or any other manifestation that reflects a single strong 
emotion. While using Statue, the wraith can take no physical 
action — he does not move, speak, or breathe.

System: The player spends 2 Pathos and rolls Charisma 
+ Embody. Each success allows the character to remain solid 
for one scene or to be touched once (whichever comes first). 
While manifested, the player may spend 1 additional Pathos and 
make an opposed Charisma + Embody roll against an observer’s 
Willpower to invoke fear or dread in that observer.

Statue  is  a  physical  manifestation,  allowing  injury  as  if 
the Proctor were mortal. However, he has armor equal to his 
dots in Embody, which can soak aggravated damage. When the 
effect ends, no trace remains in the Skinlands that the wraith 
was ever there.
••• Skingrasp (Initiate)

The ability to physically manipulate objects in the Skin-
lands is one of the arts that enables the Proctors’ cross-Shroud 
tradecraft. When a wraith invokes this power, his hands simul-
taneously exist on both sides of the Shroud, appearing solid, 
but pale and translucent.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos, plus 1 Corpus for each 
hand (or other appendage, in the case of Moliated wraiths) the 
character wants to manifest, then rolls Charisma + Embody. 
Success allows the character’s hands to manifest for the scene. 
While this power is active, the character’s physical Attributes 
cannot exceed the successes rolled. The Proctor’s hands match 
each observer’s expectations of what a corpse’s hands would 
feel like.

Skingrasp is a physical manifestation, allowing injury as if 
the Proctor were mortal. Attacks targeting manifested hands 
suffer a +2 difficulty but do +1 damage.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

•••• Life-in-Death (Common)

This art enables the wraith to manifest in a solid approxi-
mation of his mortal body. This manifestation’s appearance is 
subject to the vagaries of memory and self-idealization, so minor 
imperfections are washed away. This form has darker hair and 
paler skin than the living original, tends to be more attractive, 
and has cold skin with no pulse or breath. Otherwise, the wraith 
is clearly recognizable, though close friends will notice the dif-
ferences. The focus required to maintain this form leaves the 
wraith unable to devote his full attention to his surroundings, 
so he seems a bit oblivious and distracted, but he  can move, 
speak, and interact with his physical environment.

System: The player spends 2 Pathos and rolls Manipulation 
+ Embody; each success allows manifestation for one scene. 
While the character is Embodied, the difficulty of all Mental 
and  Social  rolls  increases  by  1.  The  character  must  be  in  a 
humanlike form to use Life-in-Death; wraiths Moliated into 
objects can’t use this art. The player may substitute the charac-
ter’s Manipulation score for his Appearance while manifested. 
Life-in-Death is a physical manifestation, allowing injury 

as if the Proctor were mortal.
•••• Shroudguide (Initiate)

With Shroudguide and a sufficiency of resolve, the wraith 
can share the effects of his other Embody arts. The Proctors’ 
Guild once guarded this art’s existence jealously, as it threatened 
their monopoly on Skinlands action. When Charon’s wrath 
descended on the Guild, the secret broke as fleeing Proctors 
bargained whatever they could to escape the forges. It’s still not 
commonly practiced due to the toll it exacts on all participants.
System: The Proctor may activate Shroudguide in con-
junction with any other Embody art that allows manifestation 
in the lands of the living, extending it to a maximum number 
of other wraiths equal to his Stamina. He must be in physical 
contact  with  all  other  subjects  (though  they  don’t  have  to 
maintain contact after the art is activated). The player pays an 
additional 2 Pathos, 1 Corpus, and 1 Willpower per additional 
traveler. Each other wraith loses 2 Corpus and 1 Willpower, 
and her Shadow gains 2 temporary Angst.
••••• Materialize (Common)

The  wraith  can  reconstruct  his  mortal  body  in  almost 
perfect detail, briefly assuming a semblance of his former life. 

While Materialized, any medical test reveals him to be a living 
human — though his true nature remains obvious to occult 
senses. He can breathe, eat, sweat, cry, bleed, and die as any 
other human. This art exacts a heavy toll on the Proctor, but 
few are unwilling to pay the price once they realize the benefits: 
A Materialized wraith has the full freedom of action that his 
former mortal form once possessed.

System: The player spends 3 Pathos and 3 Corpus and rolls 
Manipulation + Embody. The Proctor manifests for one turn 
per success. If the Proctor is attuned to all living witnesses, this 
increases to one hour per success. The character must be in a 
humanlike form to use Materialize. 

Obviously, Materialize is a physical manifestation, allowing 
injury — and pain — as if the Proctor were mortal. Each health 
level of damage the wraith suffers while using this art gives his 
Shadow 1 temporary Angst.
••••• Harrow the Mortal Flesh (Initiate)

Most Embody arts focus on bringing the wraith to the lands 
of  the  living.  Harrow  the  Mortal  Flesh  inverts  this  process. 
With this art, the Proctor can drag a living subject into the 
Shadowlands, enlisting her aid or giving her a glimpse of what 
awaits her upon death. Unprepared and unwilling victims of 
this art rarely react well to their experiences.

System:  The  wraith  must  touch  his  target.  The  player 
spends 3 Pathos and 3 Corpus and rolls Manipulation + Embody. 
If the target is unwilling, she may resist with a Willpower roll 
(difficulty 10 minus the local Shroud rating). If the target is 
another supernatural being (i.e., anything but a mortal), this 
art’s Pathos cost increases to 6.

With success, the target enters the Shadowlands for one 
minute per success (one hour per success if the wraith is at-
tuned to her). If the target was willing, she loses 1 temporary 
Willpower and the Proctor’s Shadow gains 1 Angst. If the target 
was unwilling, she makes a Willpower roll (difficulty of the local 
Shroud). For each die that isn’t a success, she loses 1 temporary 
Willpower and the Proctor’s Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst. 
If she falls to 0 temporary Willpower as a result of this roll, the 
Proctor’s Shadow gains 3 more temporary Angst.

If the target dies or is Soulforged while in the Shadowlands, 
the Proctor’s Shadow gains 10 temporary Angst. If the target 
dies, she automatically becomes a Spectre too.

Oracles

othing escapes Fate. The dead know this 
better than the living. Everything in the 
Underworld has a destiny, a reason for 
its continued existence after death or 
destruction,  though  it’s  not  always 
obvious. Every wraith has some vague 
awareness of Fate. Many never see 

choose the gaudiest possible attire and go about with their eyes 
hidden, though only the eldest remember this fashion’s origins 
as an expression of solidarity with their ancient partners in 

the Harbingers’ Guild.

Many  Oracles  rely  on  a  particular  technique,  tool, 
or meditation to focus their arts. Tarot cards, tea leaves, 
tongue-in-cheek relic Ouija boards, the entrails of rare 
plasmics: Nothing is too outré for the dedicated seer. 
This  practice  is  as  common  outside  the  Oracles’ 

beyond  the  occasional  premonition  or  intuitive 
leap, but those who seek a deeper understanding 
of chance and destiny find themselves drawn to 
Fatalism, the Arcanos of tracing and tangling 
the threads of Fate’s tapestry. 

Stygian wisdom holds that Oracles don’t 

choose Fate; rather, Fate chooses its Oracles. 
Fatalism is a subtle Arcanos with few out-
ward  manifestations,  one  which  often 
begins as a spontaneous manifestation 
rather  than  a  deliberate  attempt  to 
learn Fate’s secrets. Some of history’s 
strongest Oracles had no interest in 
becoming Fate’s tools before their first 
experiences with its power.

Each Oracle has a unique relationship 

with  Fatalism  and  the  forces  it  channels. 
Some insights come with crystal clarity and 
mathematical precision, but most skitter hazily 
out of reach, lurking at the edge of the Oracle’s 
mind. Outside the most cut-and-dried situations, 
Fate’s  complexity  makes  simple  answers  difficult 
at  best,  a  complication  which  lends  Oracles  an 
oft-warranted  reputation  for  vagueness  and  evasion. 
Prophecy has never been an exact science.

Guildmarks
Each  Oracle  bears  raised  scars  or  tattoo-like  patterns 
representing his preferred form of divination. These markings 
move of their own accord, though attempts to interpret the 
changes  rarely  bring  any  usable  insight.  Many  Guildwraiths 

Guild as it is within.

The Guild

If any group can challenge the Artificers 
for the title of eldest Guild, it’s the Oracles’ 
Guild.  Since  the  Underworld’s  earliest 
nights,  wraiths  who  share  Fate’s  mark 
have  sought  out  others  of  their  own 
kind to share knowledge and burdens 
they  couldn’t  begin  to  explain  to 
outsiders. With this common experi-
ence, Circles naturally collaborated to 
interpret their members’ visions — and, at 
times, to act upon them. The Oracles’ great-
est internal dispute has always been whether 
they  should  observe  passively,  share  their 
knowledge  with  outsiders,  or  act  aggressively 
as  Fate’s  agents.  Over  the  millennia,  opinion’s 
pendulum  has  swung  through  the  full  arc  many 
times, giving the Guild a mixed reputation as aloof 

and inscrutable meddlers.

Oracle activity reached its most recent nadir during 
the War of the Guilds. Strict neutrality preserved the 
Oracles’ wealth. Afterward, the Guild gradually reopened 
its temples and dispatched highly paid aides to select Stygian 
nobles. The Oracles restricted themselves to advisory roles, 
though, until Charon sought counsel from Grand High Oracle 
Selena. Furious upon hearing the first portion of his fate, he

exiled her from the Isle of Sorrows before she could convey the 
remainder of her prophecy.

For much of the Guild, the Temple is relevant only as their link 
to the Lady of Fate and, through her, the mechanisms of empire.

This disgrace impelled younger Oracles to throw 

in with the Artificers’ coup. Elder Guildwraiths 
held their tongues despite knowing the price to 
come — and, when the Legions responded with 
sword  and  barrow-flame,  offered  themselves  as 
sacrifice.  The  resulting  power  vacuum  allowed 
the  coup’s  supporters  to  claim  many  leadership 
positions, reinvigorating the guild.

Today’s  Oracles’  Guild  is  a  visible  and 

proactive  force  in  Underworld  affairs. 
Glimpses of the future impel many wraiths 
to intercede where they otherwise would 
have stood idly by. The Guild offers a 
network  that  often  succeeds  where  a 
lone Oracle’s efforts would fail. Only in 
the most conservative Necropoli are the 
Oracles  still  a  quasi-mystical  Fate  cult 
that maintains the full hoary rituals and 
trappings of its forebears. 

Factions
The ancient argument over interpreting 
and using Fate’s gifts (or curses) still shapes the 
modern Oracles. The Hands (as in “of Fate”) are 
the guild’s modern faces, wraiths driven to solve 
the problems that Fatalism shows them. They’d 
be dangerous if they could agree on priorities and 
methods. Almost as numerous are the Gamblers, 
genteel adventurers for whom Fatalism is a way 
to beat the odds, whether in poker or parkour. 
Born of Victorian occult practices and reinvigo-
rated with New Age mysticism, the Clairvoyants 
are hedonists whose panoply of practices leaves 
them on the Guild’s fringe — but does make for 
good recruiting.

Tradition-minded Oracles are on the decline, 
due in part to differences in technique that still 
hamper cooperation. Delphics fixate on ritual, from 
meditative trances to the finest sartorial subtleties. 
While they’re the acknowledged masters of Fatalism, 
few wraiths have the patience for their painstaking 
exactitude. The grim-faced Augurs rely on sacrifice 
to fuel their divinations, which tints their visions 
toward Oblivion and leaves them on the Legions’ 
target list. 

The  Pantheonic  Temple  centers  its  activity  on 
the  eponymous  structure,  once  the  Oracles’  heart 
but now largely seen as a dusty library and museum. 
Selena, still the guild’s titular head, leads the Temple 
in elaborate divinations, while a dwindling circle of 
archivists  gamely  catalogues  the  reports  and  visions 
which trickle in from Oracles across the Underworld. 

Fatalism
Fatalism Systems

Any use of Fatalism requires the Oracle to see or touch 
his  subject.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  perceiving  a  subject 
across the Shroud has a difficulty of the local Shroud rating, 
while perceiving a subject on the same side of the 

Shroud has a difficulty of 6.

If a subject is aware of the Oracle’s Fatal-
ism use, she may spend Willpower to aid the 
roll. This stacks with those of the Oracle’s 
own Willpower expenditure, if any.
• Kismet (Common)

Fatalism’s earliest lesson is to perceive 
other beings’ place in Fate’s design — and 
their connection to death. Kismet is the 
art of reading deathmarks, the signs that 
portend a mortal’s imminent demise or 
reflect the manner of a wraith’s death. It 
also can reveal the subject’s importance 
in Fate’s grand tapestry.

System: The player rolls Perception 
+ Fatalism. One success reveals the general 
manner of the subject’s death (i.e., which 
Legion  would  rightfully  claim  her).  With 
three successes, her death’s proximate cause 
is  obvious.  Additional  successes  reveal 
more  details  of  her  death’s  circumstances 
or indirect causes.

Furthermore, even one success gives the 
wraith a sense of the subject’s general impor-
tance in the “overall scheme of things.” This is 
handy for determining who in a scene requires 
closer attention and who’s just a spear carrier.
• Friendly Card (Initiate)

An Oracle knows nothing is truly left to 
chance.  Fate’s  grand  design  affects  even  the 
smallest turnings. Through learning to read these 
details, the wraith can nudge the outcome of seem-
ingly random minor events or consistently select 
the preferred option from apparently equal choices.
System: When the Oracle is confronted with 
a  seemingly  random  choice  (left  Byway  or  right 
Byway,  cake  or  death),  the  player  may  spend  1 
Pathos  to  automatically  select  the  best  possible 
option.  As  “best”  can  be  subjective,  the  player 
must specify whether he wants the most beneficial 
(or  least  damaging)  option  for  his  character  or  the  option 
that will best further the story.

DIVINATORY RITUALS

Most arts work as single actions or over a 
few minutes. Fatalism follows this pattern but 
the Arcanos and the Oracles’ Guild draw inspi-
ration from traditional divinatory practices that 
are more time consuming.

As an optional rule, the Storyteller may al-
low ritual divination to enhance Fatalism. The 
Oracle should have appropriate materials (relic 
crystal ball, Stygian paper tarot cards inscribed 
with  Pardoner’s  Ink,  soulsteel  augural  blade 
and sacrificial Thrall, or an equivalent) and an 
appropriate venue. The ritual working takes at 
least an hour. At the Storyteller’s discretion, the 
ritual may reduce difficulties, add extra dice, or 
provide additional details or a glimpse farther 
into the future or past.

Botching  a  divinatory  ritual  should  be 
spectacularly  disastrous  in  a  manner  befitting 
the Oracle’s ties to Fate. 

In addition, whenever the wraith is involved in a game 
of chance or equivalent situation with a randomly determined 
outcome, the player may spend 2 Pathos to add the character’s 
Fatalism to one related roll’s dice pool, or to add or subtract the 
character’s Fatalism from the result of one single-die roll. If the 
roll fails or the Oracle loses despite Friendly Card’s intervention, 
the Oracle’s Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst (3 if it’s a botch).
•• Foreshadow (Common)

The Oracle’s attunement to Fate allows him to sense when 
it turns its attention to him. As a constant low-level aware-
ness, it can give a few moments’ warning of imminent danger. 
Concentration can reveal subtler signs of major events on the 
horizon.

System: The player adds the wraith’s dots in Fatalism to any 
Perception-based roll to detect an ambush, trap, or similar source 
of immediate bodily harm. This is automatic and has no cost.
Additionally, once per day, the wraith may concentrate for 
10 minutes to sense impending major events that will affect 
him directly. The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Perception + 
Fatalism. Each success grants one day’s warning of a significant 
event and whether its net effect on the Oracle is more likely to 
be positive or negative. Each warning of a net negative event 
gives the Oracle’s Shadow 1 temporary Angst.
•• Retrace (Initiate)

To the practiced eye, every tug on Fate’s threads leaves 
evidence. This art enables the Oracle to follow up on these clues, 
discerning how a subject’s destiny has previously been altered.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Perception 
+ Fatalism. Each success reveals one prior alteration of the sub-
ject’s fate, starting with the most recent and working backward. 
For each alteration, the Oracle learns when it occurred, who 
was responsible (at least in general terms, if he doesn’t know 
the actor), and what the subject’s unmodified fate would have 
been. The more profound the alteration, the more detail arises.
••• Reading the Bones (Common)

With this art, the Oracle delves deeper into Fate’s designs 
for other beings or objects. The resulting visions are snapshots 
of what will occur without outside intervention, so Reading the 
Bones often prompts proactive Oracles to move to reinforce or 
deter Fate’s decrees.

System: The wraith concentrates on his subject for one 
minute.  The  player  spends  2  Pathos  and  rolls  Perception  + 
Fatalism. He may then ask the Storyteller one simple question 
per success about the subject’s future as it currently stands (i.e., 
without intervention from anyone who knows Fate’s plan). The 
Storyteller is within her rights to give cryptic or incomplete 
answers.

Reading the Bones has one blind spot: the Oracle himself. 
Any  attempt  to  self-predict  with  this  art  gives  the  wraith’s 
Shadow 1 temporary Angst per success as paradoxical visions 
of action and inaction overwhelm the Oracle. Such efforts only 
yield cryptic and incomplete answers.
••• Malocchio (Initiate)

The “evil eye” is an ancient and vicious art. With a whis-
pered  malediction,  the  Oracle  taints  the  victim’s  threads  in 
Fate’s tapestry, cursing her with ill luck and marking her with 
signs visible only to other Oracles.

System: The player spends 3 Pathos and rolls Wits + Fatal-
ism (difficulty of the target’s Willpower). The wraith’s Shadow 
gains 3 temporary Angst — though if it agrees that the target 
had it coming, the Shadowguide may immediately spend this 
Angst to add 3 successes to the roll. For one day per success, 
the target suffers bad luck. There is no standard mechanical 
effect, but the Storyteller should feel free to shower the victim 
with lost or broken possessions, Bad Luck (as per the Thorn), 
harassment from rival factions, and similar unpleasantness.

While Malocchio remains in effect, any character who per-
ceives the victim with any Fatalism art automatically becomes 
aware of the curse and its author’s identity.

The player may spend 1 Willpower to increase Malocchio’s 
duration to one week per success. If he spends 1 permanent 
Willpower,  this  becomes  one  year  per  success.  The  Oracle’s 
Shadow gains 3 more temporary Angst or 1 permanent Angst, 
respectively.

Malocchio’s  victim  can  remove  the  curse  only  through 
roleplaying. First, though, she must be aware that there is indeed 
an author to her bad luck…

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

FATALISM AND WHEATON’S LAW

Accurate prophecy can be a plot breaker in 
roleplaying games. For this reason (and because 
it’s appropriate to the source material), several 
Fatalism  arts  allow  the  Storyteller  to  provide 
answers that are less than straightforward. In all 
such cases, it’s essential to keep in mind that the 
player paid experience points to buy the art with 
the understanding that it would be useful. Don’t 
provide answers solely designed to frustrate and 
confuse  your  players.  The  information  gained 
from Fatalism should always be worth the price 
of Guild admission.

Conversely, players who invest heavily in 
Fatalism should bear in mind that many legends 
of prophets and oracles are ultimately tragic. Hav-
ing unique insight doesn’t mean a character is in 
a position to change anything, nor will anyone 
else  automatically  believe  him.  Most  wraiths 
who’ve  been  around  for  a  while  are  familiar 
with  Fatalism’s  limitations  and  take  anything 
an Oracle says with a grain of proverbial salt. 
There’s a reason the Guild invokes Cassandra’s 
name so frequently.

•••• Sidestep (Common)

Heightening  his  attunement  to  immediate  dangers,  the 
Oracle gains preternatural awareness of attacks before the at-
tackers swing or fire. This can allow the wraith to be where the 
attacks aren’t, or to interpose himself between a friend and a 
bullet from a maggot revolver.

System: A number of times per turn equal to the character’s 
Wits, the player may spend 1 Pathos to grant the wraith an 
extra defensive maneuver (p. 331). The Oracle can’t perform 
more than one defensive maneuver against any given attack.

If the player also spends 1 Willpower when activating this art, 
the resulting defensive maneuver may intercept an attack target-
ing anyone or anything within the wraith’s running movement 
distance (as modified by Argos or other effects). If the player’s 
successes equal or exceed the attacker’s, the Oracle moves to 
interpose himself between the attacker and her intended victim, 
then takes the attack upon himself, suffering full damage as if he 
had been the intended target. If the player rolls fewer successes 
than the attacker, the Oracle takes 1 health level of damage per 
success and the intended victim suffers the remainder.

Whenever an attack strikes the Oracle despite (or because 

of) Sidestep, his Shadow gains 2 temporary Angst.
•••• Entangle (Initiate)

Described by older Oracles as a binding rite and modern 
ones as an invocation of quantum mechanics, Entangle conjoins 

TRAITS

165

two or more wraiths’ very existences. This can be a blessing or a 
doom, as the entangled characters share experiences, energies, 
and destiny itself.

System: The Oracle must touch both subjects (or, if more 
than two subjects are to be Entangled, the whole group must 
hold hands or otherwise be in physical contact with one another 
and the Oracle). The player spends 3 Pathos and 1 Willpower 
per subject and rolls Wits + Fatalism (difficulty of the highest 
Willpower among the subjects).

With a number of successes equal to or greater than the 
number of subjects, all subjects are entangled until the Oracle 
chooses to end the entanglement. During this time, whenever 
any entangled character gains more than 1 Pathos in a single 
go, each other character gains 1 Pathos. However, whenever 
any entangled character’s Shadow gains more than 1 temporary 
Angst, each other Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst, and when-
ever any entangled character suffers more than 1 health level 
of lethal or aggravated damage, each other character suffers 1 
health level of bashing damage.

Each entangled character has a general sense of each other 
character’s  location  and  emotional  state,  including  whether 
she’s currently Shadowridden. In addition, entangled characters 
find themselves drawn toward one another or acting on each 
other’s behalf during significant events. This latter aspect has 
no  mechanical  effect  but  the  Storyteller  should  ensure  that 
all  entangled  characters  are  somehow  positioned  to  affect 
the outcome of critical scenes. This serves as an excuse for all 
manner of implausible coincidences as Fate conspires to put 
the characters where they need to be to play their parts in one 
another’s dramas or tragedies.

Entangle  works  only  on  wraiths  and  no  more  than  one 
application of Entangle may affect a wraith at any one time. 
The Oracle may include himself in any entanglement without 
paying Pathos or Willpower, and he doesn’t count toward the 
required number of successes. He may spend 1 Willpower to 
end an entanglement of his creation at any time.

If an entangled wraith suffers a Harrowing, his entangle-
ment is snapped and the rest of the group is instantly aware that 
something bad happened. The rest of the group’s entanglement 
remains intact. 
••••• Breathing the Mists (Common)

The Oracle immerses himself in events to come, gaining a 
measure of foreknowledge. Understanding at the time of these 
visions is rare. Most often, Fate provides only vague generali-
ties. These aren’t enough to issue intelligible warnings, but they 
are sufficient to inform preparations. The Oracle himself rarely 
knows the precise set of events for which he’s readying himself 
until they’re upon him, but to outsiders, it looks like he knew 
exactly what was coming.

System: At the beginning of the session, the player spends 
4 Pathos and 1 Willpower and rolls Perception + Fatalism, not-
ing his number of successes. Subsequently, at any time during 

that session, he may expend one or more of these successes to 
describe an action the Oracle previously took to prepare for 
the current scene’s events. The action must be something the 
wraith plausibly could have accomplished “off-screen,” and its 
complexity and specificity determine the number of successes 
the player must expend to establish it:
One success  Advantageous in a minor way (“Well, I have a 
relic handcuff key, but we’ll still need to get out 
of the citadel before the maelstrom breaks.”)

Two successes  Helps  resolve  a  generalized,  nonviolent  plot 
obstacle (“Ah, Colonel Sexton, I see my letter 
of introduction from the Diamond Regent on 
your desk. Surely it’s within your purview to 
grant us access to the Imperial Peace Museum?”)
Three successes  Useful in combat, or specific to a given threat 
or complication (“I paid a fortune for this coat. 
Hoped I’d never need it, but I see the Alche-
mists’ acid-resistant plasmic leather works as 
advertised.”)

Four successes  Fits the scene’s details, providing major advan-
tage  (“Contessa,  if  you  sign  that  decree,  the 
Legion  will  learn  what  happened  to  the  last 
Anacreon. Don’t think all your puppets went 
to the forges.”)

Five successes  Exactingly specific and relevant to a major plot 
twist (“I suspected you might betray us, so I took 
the liberty of securing the loyalty of all of your 
soldiers through generous contributions of oboli at 
the barracks before the evening’s festivities began.”)
At the end of the session, any unused successes carry over 
to the next session. However, the Oracle loses them if he doesn’t 
use Breathing the Mists at the beginning of the next session, too.
••••• Ensnare (Initiate)

The Oracle’s greatest weapon grossly and irrevocably alters a 
victim’s destiny. By entangling a subject in Fate’s web, the wraith 
redefines not only her existence but her role in things to come.
System: The player spends 5 Pathos and 2 Willpower and 
makes  an  opposed  Wits  +  Fatalism  roll  against  the  subject’s 
Willpower. His Shadow gains 2 temporary Angst per success 
the subject rolls. If the roll succeeds, the player redefines the 
victim’s destiny in broad terms, preferably ones suitably vague 
to make a good classical prophecy.

Unless  the  victim  is  actively  working  to  fulfill  her  new 
destiny,  all  her  rolls  to  regain  Pathos  have  their  difficulties 
increased  by  1,  all  her  Fetters  are  considered  to  be  one  dot 
weaker,  and  she  can’t  spend  Willpower.  The  only  ways  out 
of Fate’s snare are to play out her new destiny to the logical 
conclusion or to roleplay her way back to Fate’s original plan 
for her. The table at large — the Storyteller and all players — 
are the ultimate arbiters of when the victim has met either of 
these story objectives.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Alchemists

The Guild

he  underworld  has  little  in  the  way  of 
material  wealth  or  natural  resources.  Its 
primary  raw  materials  are  ore  scraped 
from the Labyrinth’s upper fringes and 
souls deemed too useless or dangerous 
to  continue  to  exist  among  the 
Restless.  Most  wraiths  accept 

this process as the price of continued Underworld 
civilization,  but  every  generation  of  newcomers 
has  had  its  share  of  artisans  and  unnatural 
philosophers who seek innovation — or a more 
palatable alternative to soulforging. 

An outgrowth of the study of relics, Flux 
is  the  Arcanos  of  working  with  material 
things and their memories. Using its arts, 
an Alchemist can reshape the echoes of 
objects that linger after their Skinlands 
prototypes’ destruction. She can also 
reach across the Shroud to preserve 
or destroy physical items. Such power 
could  easily  threaten  the  Artificers’ 
soulforging monopoly if the eldest Guild 
had not so thoroughly painted Flux as a 
feared tool of Oblivion.

Guildmarks
As  a  wraith  works  with  the  echoes  and 

reflections  of  inanimate  objects,  they,  in  turn, 
mold  her  self-image.  Parts  of  every  Alchemist 
look  manufactured:  hinged  joints,  rivets,  welds, 
mold  flashing  paralleling  her  long  bones,  perhaps  a 
manufacturer’s mark from her birth city or a barcode of 
a personally significant phrase. These guildmarks evolve 
with the Alchemist’s tastes, reflecting the types of relics 
with which she prefers to work. 

The Alchemists began as Artificers with little aptitude 
for  soulforging,  who  sought  other  ways  to  distinguish 
themselves within their Guild. Studying the relationships 
between  naturally  occurring  relics  and  those  created 
through  Inhabit,  they  came  to  see  Flux  as  an  ideal 
tool for working with matter and its Shadowlands 
equivalents.  Their  first  efforts  garnered  little  at-
tention, but once they demonstrated the capacity 
to reshape relics, Artificer leaders took notice. 
Unfortunately for the researchers, so too did 
a  cabal  of  smiths  and  Nhudri  cultists  who 
saw the research as both blasphemous and 
a threat to their economic hegemony.

The  “Alchemist”  moniker  came 
from opponents who used it to imply a 
connection between the Flux experi-
menters and the eponymous mortal 
charlatans who claimed to be able to 
turn  lead  into  gold.  The  researchers 
quickly adopted it as a badge of honor, 
though,  and  when  the  final  split  with 
the Artificers came, the Alchemists’ Guild 
proudly claimed the name and its connota-
tions.  Sadly,  the  Dictum  Mortuum  provided 
the perfect excuse for the smiths to lower the 
hammer on their wayward cousins (and potential 
competitors). Under pressure from the Artificers 
and their allied Guilds, the Deathlords decreed Flux an 
abomination for its entropic connections to Oblivion 
and outlawed the Alchemists.

The Alchemists survived the intervening centuries 
by finding places where the Artificers had little pull and 
the Legions had higher priorities. They weren’t invited to 

TRAITS

167

sign the Compact of Guilds, much less to join the revolt against 
Charon. Indeed, some aided Stygia, seeing the chance to pay 
back the Artificers for centuries of persecution. This aid didn’t 
go unnoticed in all Necropoli. Today, in any 
Citadel where the Artificers hold little sway, 
it’s likely that a Circle of Alchemists still does 
business while the local establishment looks 
the other way — or even relies on their wares. 
Some  Alchemists  also  offer  rogue  Artificers 
fleeing  their  former  guildmates  protection, 
though they’ve long since learned to be wary of 
infiltrators.
Factions
Despite the Alchemists’ Guild’s 

would be worth if the Alchemist purchased it with the Relics 
Background.

The weight of matter (or relic equivalent) an Alchemist 
can affect with any Flux art depends on her mastery of Flux 
and her strength of will. Treat this as a feat of strength (p. 320), 
substituting Flux for Strength and consulting the “Lift” column 
for the maximum mass the wraith can alter. As with a normal 
feat of strength, the player may roll Willpower (difficulty 6) to 
increase the wraith’s effective Flux. However, unlike a normal 
feat of strength, each such attempt costs 1 Pathos.

• Rot (Common)

small  size,  it’s  remained  surpris-
ingly formal, partly from its Ar-
tificer  origins.  Mostly,  though, 
it’s  because  Alchemists  try  to 
offset their bad reputation with 
ostentatious  professionalism. 
An  elaborate  arrangement  of 
Circles  acknowledges  profi-
ciency  with  Flux,  while  different  Orders 
apply  the  Guild’s  body  of  knowledge  to 
diverse  ends.  The  Ordinis  Denarii  is  the 
Alchemists’  commercial  arm,  supplant-
ing  or  competing  with  the  Artificers 
where the local authorities permit such 
trade. Scientifically inclined Alchemists 
gravitate to the Ordinis Velum and study 
the Shroud, the processes of transition 
across it, and the relationships shared 
among Oblivion, entropy, chemistry, 
and physics. The Ordinis Oxidato at-
tracts the guild’s ill-regarded fringe of 
militants and nihilists, who are most 
likely to use Flux as a weapon or to 
instruct outsiders in it. Most Alchemists 
embrace  disruptive  trends  (“catalysts,” 
in Guild parlance) to some degree. The 
most egregious adaptor of modern mortal 
technology  to  the  Underworld,  and  the 
Artificers’ particular bête noire, is the peri-
odically renamed Ordinis Silicium.

Flux
Flux Systems

Unless  otherwise  stated,  each 
Flux art’s difficulty is the local Shroud 
rating.

Any  Flux  art  referring  to  a  relic’s 

“value” is shorthand for the number of dots the relic 

168

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Flux’s most basic application increases the 
rate of decay in a material object within the 
Alchemist’s line of sight. Its effect on metal, 
ceramics, and other durable materials is too 
small to matter in most cases, but it can 
inflict months of dissolution on organic 
matter within a few minutes. This can 
hasten an object’s destruction and pos-
sible  transition  to  relic  state,  destroy 
organic evidence of wrongdoing, or revolt 
and terrify mortals who witness bubbling cor-

ruption claiming their dinner.

System:  The  player  spends  1  Pathos  and  rolls 
Dexterity  +  Flux.  If  the  Alchemist  isn’t  touching 
the object, the player also spends 1 Willpower. The 
number of successes determine how much the target 
object ages over the rest of the scene:
1 success 
2 successes  One month
3 successes  One year
4 successes  One decade
5 successes  One century

One week

The  Storyteller  determines  the  effects 
aging has on a given object, including dam-
age  if  appropriate.  Rot  can’t  directly  affect  living 
creatures or wraiths, though it does foster the growth 
of  microorganisms  that  might  inflict  some  nasty 
infections if ingested.
• Sense Fluxion (Initiate)

Flux can be a subtle Arcanos, and casual observ-
ers rarely can tell the difference between its entropic 
processes and those of nature or the Shadowlands. An 
Alchemist always knows her guildmates’ work, though.
System: The wraith examines a subject for Flux 
effects. The player rolls Perception + Flux (diffi-
culty 6). One success reveals whether or not Flux 
has affected the target. With three successes, the 
Alchemist knows which Flux art was used. With five, 
she can recognize the unique signatures each wraith’s 
personal Flux applications leave, effectively seeing an 

Arcanos “fingerprint” that she can match against other instances 
to identify another Flux user.
•• Reinforce (Common)

Reversing the entropic lessons of Rot, Reinforce makes a 
material object more resistant to decay and damage. This art 
is taxing, as the Alchemist infuses the matter with part of her 
own Corpus, lending it some of her deathless nature.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and 1 Corpus and rolls 
Dexterity + Flux. Each success increases the target’s durability 
by 1 for the purposes of any feat of strength (p. 320) required to 
break or destroy it. This increase can’t exceed the Alchemist’s 
dots in Flux.

Reinforce’s full strength lasts one day per success. After that, 
its effects dissipate at a rate of one point of durability per day.
•• Non-Euclidean Mechanics (Initiate)

As the Underworld echoes of destroyed things, relics are 
unitary objects to most wraiths. Disassembling a relic Mustang 
with relic tools results in its destruction, not an oil and Pathos 
change. The Alchemist skilled in Non-Euclidean Mechanics 
knows how to tease apart a technological relic, modify it, and 
reassemble  it  in  a  repaired  or  upgraded  condition.  This  art 
relies as much on intent and metaphor as it does mechanical 
prowess. To outside observers, the Alchemist’s work seems to 
violate anything they knew of Skinlands physics and geometry.
System: To repair a damaged relic, the Alchemist works 
on it for one hour. The player spends Corpus equal to the relic’s 
value and rolls Dexterity + Flux (difficulty 6, increasing to 8 if 
the wraith lacks appropriate tools). With success, the relic is 
repaired. Each additional success reduces the working time by 
10 minutes (minimum 10 minutes).

To improve a relic, the Alchemist works on it for one hour. 
The player spends 2 Pathos and 2 Corpus and rolls Dexterity + 
Flux (difficulty 7, increasing to 9 if the wraith lacks appropri-
ate tools). The Alchemist may improve one numerical value 
of the relic by one point per success (e.g., increase a weapon’s 
Damage by 1, add an additional soak die to armor, streamline 
a relic computer to grant a one-die bonus to appropriate tasks 
in which it’s used). Normally, this effect’s full strength lasts for 
one day per success, after which it dissipates at a rate of one 
point of improvement per day. To make the upgrade permanent, 
the player may choose to spend an additional 2 Pathos and 1 
Willpower when invoking Non-Euclidean Mechanics. 

No relic may have a total value of improvements greater 

than the Alchemist’s rating in Flux.
••• Decay (Common)

This art causes deterioration in even the strongest relics or 
material objects. Metal oxidizes and develops stress fractures, 
ceramics turn brittle and crack, wood dry rots or molders, and 
so forth. Decay can target an entire object or only a portion 
of it — a gun’s hammer spring, one leg of a table, or the bolts 
connecting a helicopter’s rotors and hub. As with Rot, Decay 

can’t affect living beings or creatures of the Underworld. How-
ever, its effects manifest much faster than Rot and encompass 
a wider array of materials.

System: The player spends 2 Pathos and rolls Dexterity + 
Flux (normal difficulty in the Shadowlands, difficulty 6 in the 
Tempest, and difficulty 5 in the Labyrinth). The Alchemist’s 
Shadow gains 2 temporary Angst. If the Alchemist isn’t touch-
ing the object, the player also spends 1 Willpower. The target 
object suffers one level of aggravated damage per success.
••• Relic Dowsing (Initiate)

The Alchemist’s affinity for the memories of matter gives 
her an intuitive sense for recently destroyed items that may 
have crossed the Shroud. Relic Dowsing allows the wraith to 
search for newly formed relics with a fair expectation of find-
ing something (though not always exactly what she expects).
System: This art is usable only in the Shadowlands and 
requires about an hour of focused searching. The player spends 
3  Pathos  and  rolls  Perception  +  Flux.  The  roll’s  difficulty 
depends on the mortal population density and the amount of 
recent destruction or decay. A literal urban war zone is 4, while 
a pristine, unpopulated wilderness is 10. Most cities split the 
difference at 7. 

Successes on this roll determine what the Alchemist finds:
A trivial relic with sentimental value to someone

1 success 
2 successes  A minor relic with some practical use
3 successes  A useful or collectible/profitable relic 
4 successes  A major, valuable relic, or one that’s relevant to 
the Alchemist’s interests or hobbies
5 successes  A powerful relic, immediately useful to the Al-

chemist’s current needs

The Alchemist also can use this art to determine the location 
of a specific relic with which she is familiar (e.g., her favorite 
wrench). In this case, her difficulty is 9 minus the relic’s value. 
More successes give her a clearer sense of the relic’s position — 
though getting to it may be another issue entirely.
•••• Render Relic (Common)

This art allows the Alchemist to sense the emotions that 
went into a relic’s creation — and then to distill the relic down 
to the bare essence of those component sensations. This process 
destroys the relic but yields Pathos flavored with the moment 
the relic crossed the Shroud. The Alchemist can either absorb 
this energy herself or bottle it for later use. Render Relic isn’t 
a universal solvent, though. Some relics are too large to suc-
cumb to this process, while others bear a strange immunity to 
it — along with the Flux signatures of Guild elders. 

System: The Alchemist spends five minutes in concentra-
tion while touching the relic. The player spends 1 Pathos and 
rolls Perception + Flux (difficulty 7). The wraith’s Shadow gains 
1 Angst. With success, the relic is destroyed, and the Alchemist 
receives 1 Pathos per success, up to a maximum of the relic’s 
value. The player may spend 1 Willpower to channel all of this 

TRAITS

169

Pathos into an appropriate container (bottle, flask, spittoon) 
rather than the Alchemist herself.

Render Relic works only on naturally occurring relics, not 
those  created  deliberately  via  the  effects  of  any  Arcanos  or 
other supernatural power. Nor can it dissolve Artifacts. Finally, 
it can’t affect anything the Alchemist can’t pick up and carry.
•••• Sculpt Matter’s Memory (Initiate)

As an Alchemist’s understanding of relics grows, she comes 
to see the memories and emotional investments that bind and 
solidify  their  forms.  With  this  art,  she  can  exploit  the  flaws 
and blank spots in these echoes to temporarily alter a relic’s 
appearance.  While  so  altered,  the  item  retains  its  original 
function, even if this is incompatible with its new form. Tales 
of Alchemists slaying enemies with silk bouquets or working 
the forges with quill pens are evidence of this art. So, too, are 
stories  of  impossible  smuggling  operations  and  disappearing 
criminal evidence…

System: The Alchemist spends five minutes in concentra-
tion while touching the relic. The player spends Pathos equal 
to the relic’s rating (minimum 1) and rolls Perception + Flux 
(difficulty 6 if the relic’s new form is compatible with its func-
tion, 8 if it’s incompatible, 9 if it’s utterly nonsensical). The 
relic’s new form lasts for one scene per success. The player may 
spend 2 Willpower to extend this to one day per success.

The Alchemist can reconfigure only relics that she can pick 
up and carry, both in original form and sculpted appearance. 
She can freely change a relic’s overall dimensions so long as 
it stays portable. If a relic assumes a form that’s incompatible 
with  its  function  (e.g.,  a  sword  button,  a  bicycle  crowbar,  a 
book toothpick), any skill check involving its use suffers a +2 
difficulty (+3 for a truly outlandish transformation).
••••• A Memory of Fire (Common)

As the Alchemist’s familiarity with relics and their workings 
grows, she comes to understand the mythologies and analogies 
by which they function in the Underworld. In doing so, she 
learns new manners of feeding them to ensure their continued 
function — and can release the stored Pathos of activated relics 
with but a glance.

System: The Alchemist can fuel any relic by infusing it 
with  1  Pathos  or  1  Corpus.  This  replaces  the  relic’s  normal 
Pathos cost for activation. Each time she fuels a relic with her 
Corpus, her Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst.

In addition, she can deactivate an empowered relic as an 
action. The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Perception + Flux; 
if  the  relic  is  under  another  character’s  direct  control,  that 
character  may  resist  by  rolling  Willpower.  If  the  Alchemist 
succeeds, the target relic becomes inert, as if no Pathos was 
spent to power it for the scene. Said relic cannot be repowered 
for the duration of the scene.

••••• Reintegrate Relic (Initiate)

Although none among the Restless have found a reliable 
way to return themselves to life (leaving aside several Arcanoi 
that create mockeries of it), elder Alchemists can return relics 
to the world of the living. This art restores a relic to its original 
material state and transports it across the Shroud. The Alche-
mist can apply Reintegrate Relic to aid mortal allies, to place 
dangerous relics beyond her enemies’ reach, or even to convert 
her own treasured relics into Fetters.

System: The Alchemist touches the relic while concentrat-
ing on it for a number of turns equal to its value. The player 
spends 1 Pathos and 1 Corpus per point of the relic’s value and 
rolls Dexterity + Flux. The wraith’s Shadow gains 1 temporary 
Angst per point of the relic’s value. With success, the relic reverts 
to its material state and crosses the Shroud into the Skinlands.
If  the  relic  is  represented  on  the  Alchemist’s  character 
sheet with the Relics Background, the player may spend any 
amount of temporary Willpower up to its recorded value. The 
relic becomes a new Fetter for the Alchemist with a value equal 
to the amount of Willpower spent.

Reintegrate Relic is usable only in the Shadowlands.

RELIC FORGING
Though the Alchemists broke from the Arti-
ficers, they never foreswore soulforging, and some 
still practice it. More of Flux’s students, however, 
learn soulforging only to apply its principles to 
their related practice of relicforging. Requiring 
sufficient mastery of Flux to be able to sense and 
work with the stuff of relics, relicforging uses the 
Underworld’s  remnants  of  destroyed  material 
objects rather than once-human souls. It’s not as 
efficient as soulforging in terms of the finished 
goods  returned  for  a  raw  material  investment, 
but  most  Alchemists  consider  it  more  reliable 
and humane.

A character capable of soulforging who also 
has Status (Alchemists’ Guild) ••• or greater is 
assumed to know relicforging. This craft operates 
identically to soulforging (p. 42), but it uses rel-
ics, rather than souls, as raw materials. Relic raw 
materials have far more spiritual impurities and 
less usable material than souls, so it takes a total 
of relics worth 20 dots of the Relics Background 
to equal a single wraith’s worth of Corpus. All 
relicforging tasks use the same dice pool as the 
equivalent soulforging tasks.

Relicforging’s  output,  relicsteel,  closely 
resembles soulsteel and follows all its rules, but 
relicsteel  items  don’t  exhibit  any  of  soulsteel’s 
disquieting  characteristics.  Additionally,  it’s 
impossible  to  alloy  relicsteel  with  soulsteel, 
death ore, or any other substance, so there’s no 
such thing as “Stygian relicsteel” (as far as the 
Alchemists are admitting).

he  phrase  “ghost  in  the  machine”  is  a 
rusted-out cliché when it comes to Inhabit,

to  immerse  his  consciousness  and 
form  within  an  inanimate  object, 
gaining increasing control over its 

Soulforging leaves its own residue on its tradeswraiths, and 
uninformed Stygian citizens often mistake these for Inhabit’s 
guildmarks. Apprentices are scorched and charred from the 
forges. Longer-serving smiths take on some of the forges’ own 
aspects, patches of their forms glowing with dull red heat. 
Smiths  of  the  Guild  wear  an  additional  unique  token 
that they forge as a rite of passage and a reminder of 
their trade’s true cost: a coin hammered from one of 

operations and fate as his prowess increases. Masters 
of Inhabit can command machinery with a touch 
or imbue simple relics with the power of Artifacts.
Before the Arcanoi, there was soulforging. 

Nhudri, Charon’s first and most trusted coun-
cilor, brought the secrets of hammer and flame 
out  of  the  Labyrinth.  Upon  his  disciples’ 
forges was Stygia wrought — and out of 
their work came Inhabit. By its nature, 
soulforging  transcends  mere  physical 
process,  requiring  a  quasi-mystic 
empathy for the material’s personal-
ity and properties. As Nhudri and his 
apprentices  refined  their  techniques, 
they  also  explored  their  growing  affin-
ity  for  the  form  and  energies  of  mortal 
engines. Inhabit is the best-known result of 
these experiments. Modern Artificers learn it 
separately from soulforging, though some of its 
ancient arts still highlight its origins.

Guildmarks
Artificers accrue wear and tear mimicking that 

of the objects they Inhabit. Those who prefer simple 
objects or physical machinery manifest scuff marks and 
gouges, smell of exhaust and hot metal, and seep lubricant 
from under their fingernails. Circuit patterns flicker under 
the skin of wraiths with a more digital bent, while running 
error logs of their internal dialogues with their Shadows scroll 
across their eyes.

their own hands.
The Guild

The Artificers’ Guild is the modern incar-
nation  of  Stygia’s  oldest  trade  organization. 
As Charon drove Stygian expansion in its 
early  centuries,  Nhudri  took  on  a  trio  of 
apprentices to satisfy the demand for tools 
and construction materials. These three 
legendary figures taught other wraiths 
the  arts  of  soulforging  and  Inhabit, 
eventually giving rise to the Society of 
the Hammer. As Stygia emulated mortal 
feudal  systems,  so  too  did  the  Society, 

restyling itself as the Artificers’ Guild.

The Artificers’ monopoly on soulforging 
was always the key to its wealth and political 
power. Vital to the Underworld’s economy, the 
Guild enjoyed a strong symbiosis with the Stygian 
power structure. Its claim to the mantle of Eldest 
Guild gave it similar pull with its nominal peers — 
though Artificer heavy handedness also aroused envy 
and contempt. This fueled the War of the Guilds, and 
the Artificers displayed unexpected finesse by emerging 
from this conflict not only undiminished but at the head 

of the Council of Guilds.

The postwar years were the Artificers’ high-water mark. 
Masterforgers enjoyed power and prestige second only to the 

172

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Deathlords’, spurring the hubris that drove their 
fatal overreach in 1598. The failed rebellion 
cost the Artificers many leaders and shattered 
their  monopoly  on  soulforging,  as  lower-
ranking fugitives traded service or lessons 
for  protection  from  Stygia’s  wrath.  Over 
subsequent  centuries,  gradual  reconciliation 
with the authorities allowed the Guild to reforge 
many of its old customs and rites. Recognizing that 
they can’t soulforge the genie into its own bottle, the 
Guild’s leaders grudgingly tolerate non-Artificer smiths, 
but  any  smith  who  doesn’t  wear  the  coin  quickly 
learns the social cost of crossing the Eldest Guild.
Under the rule of the Council of Masters, the 
Artificers remain Stygia’s most conservative Guild. 
Not all Masterforgers are active on the Council, but 
each one has a voice and a vote when he chooses 
to exercise it. Most focus on traditional arts; few 
specialists in electronics, let alone data, are admit-
ted to their ranks. Beneath the Masterforgers are 
Journeymen, those wraiths skilled enough to earn 
their own forges, and Apprentices who are still 
learning  their  craft.  Modern  Guild  customs 
superficially resemble labor union practices, 
though under the surface are a hundred secret 
societies and Nhudri-venerating mystery cults.

Factions
Though not what it was before the Breaking, 
Artificer unity remains proverbial. The Guild drills 
loyalty  unto  soulforging  into  every  apprentice. 
Having said that, political differences and diverging 
specializations have yielded some internal divisions. 
Hammerboys specialize in soulforging, while Wrench-
wraiths are masters of Inhabiting machinery. Wraiths 
who  Inhabit  Internet-connected  devices  and  ride  the 
infosphere tend to eschew labels, though older Artificers 
have several nicknames for them (none complimentary). 
Ghostriders  are  a  Wrenchwraith  subset  whose  domain  is 
transportation infrastructure; they enjoy close ties with the 
Harbingers. Artificers who possess machinery for mischievous 
or malevolent purposes are termed Gremlins.

Inhabit
Inhabit Systems

If an object is destroyed while a wraith is Inhabiting it, 
he’s ejected from the item’s remains and suffers one level of 
lethal damage.

If  a  wraith  is  attuned  to  an  object  (see  p. 

149), his Inhabit rolls against that item are at 
–2 difficulty.

Unless otherwise specified, only one wraith at a time can 
Inhabit an object. If an Artificer attempts to Inhabit something 
that already contains another wraith, the current occupant’s 
successes cancel the interloper’s on a one-for-one basis. If the 
Artificer wins anyway, the initial occupant is ejected from the 
object and suffers bashing damage equal to the Artificer’s 

net successes.

Each use of Inhabit on another wraith’s Fet-
ter grants the Artificer’s Shadow 1 temporary 

Angst.
• Assume the Shell (Common)

Inhabit’s most basic art allows a wraith 
to insert himself into an inanimate object. 
He  has  no  control  over  it  and  can’t  per-
ceive anything outside its immediate area, 
but he may study its inner workings and is 
undetectable to normal senses.

System:  The  player  rolls  Dexterity  + 
Inhabit  (difficulty  6).  Only  one  success  is 
necessary for the wraith to enter the object; 
additional  successes  provide  details  of  the 
device’s principles of operation or information 
stored  within  it.  If  a  character  scrutinizes  the 
object with any form of supernatural perception 
that could reveal the wraith’s presence, she must 
beat his successes to detect him.
• Reveal Rider (Initiate)

An Artificer learns to read the subtle 
signs  Inhabit  leaves  on  objects.  With  a 
touch, the wraith can determine whether 
an object is currently Inhabited or has been in 
the past.

System: The player rolls Dexterity + Inhabit 
(difficulty 7). Each success reveals one prior use of 
Inhabit, starting with the most recent and working 
backward.  The  wraith  gains  an  innate  sense  of 
each Artificer’s identity and will recognize her 
on sight; he also learns which Inhabit art she 
used if he knows it himself. In addition, each 
success on Reveal Rider counts as two successes 
for opposing Assume the Shell.
•• Misfire (Common)

By passing his hand through a mechanical 
or  electronic  device,  the  wraith  may  cause  a 
temporary malfunction. Gears jam, combustion 
falters, electricity shorts out or surges, and com-
plex electronics throw error messages or reboot 
themselves.  Simple  machines  are  unaffected;  a 
target must have moving parts or run on electrical 
power to be susceptible to Misfire.

TRAITS

173

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Strength + 
Inhabit (difficulty 6). The target device is disabled for one turn 
per success. The operator may attempt to fix the problem with 
a roll of Wits + an appropriate Ability (Storyteller’s discretion; 
difficulty 6); each success removes one of the wraith’s successes.
•• Forge Affinity (Initiate)

Inhabit’s origin as an outgrowth of soulforging is evident 
in this art. While any wraith can learn the smith’s art, the ex-
tension of one’s senses into the soul being worked on the forge 
remains a closely held Guild technique.

System:  The  wraith’s  dots  in  Inhabit  are  added  to  any 

soulforging roll. Once learned, this art is always active.
••• Claim the Shell (Common)

The wraith may enter a relic or a Skinlands object and use 
it as a surrogate body. He has full control over all its functions 
and can move its parts on their own, though he can’t make it 
do anything else outside its own capabilities. For example, a 
wraith  possessing  a  revolver  can  cock  the  hammer,  pull  the 
trigger, and swing out the cylinder and eject spent shell cas-
ings, but he can’t levitate or aim the gun, nor grasp and load 
fresh ammunition. His senses function normally, though they’re 
spread over the object’s entire surface. If a Skinlands object is 
destroyed while the wraith Inhabits it, he may bring it across 
the Shroud as a relic (though creating a relic from a container 
doesn’t also create relics from its contents).

System: The player spends 3 Pathos and rolls Strength + 
Inhabit (difficulty of the local Shroud, or 8 in the Tempest). 
The number of successes required for success depend on the 
item’s size:
1 success 

Handheld: tablet or notebook computer, handgun, 
power tool, book

2 successes  Two-handed:  small  appliance,  greatsword,  web 

server

3 successes  Human-sized:  motorcycle,  crew-served  heavy 

weapon, office furniture

4 successes  Vehicular: speedboat, garage workbench, assembly 

5 successes 

line laser welding robot
Industrial:  locomotive,  marine  diesel  engine, 
newspaper printing press

6+ successes  Structural: house, airliner, ship

Claim the Shell lasts for one scene. If the object is destroyed 
while the wraith is within it, his Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst 
per success required to Claim it. However, he may convert the 
item into a relic by spending 1 Willpower, plus 1 Corpus per 
success required to Claim it.
••• Smith’s Tenacity (Initiate)

Most common among Artificers who work the forges, this 
art allows a wraith to take on some of the attributes of his work’s 
output. When using Smith’s Tenacity, the character’s skin takes 
on a metallic sheen and is uncomfortably warm to the touch.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos. For the rest of the 
scene, the wraith’s dots in Inhabit are added to his soak dice 
pools, and he can soak aggravated damage with his Inhabit.
•••• Wire Rider (Common)

With this art, the Artificer can slide into the global network 
of electricity and digital communication, passing through power 
grids and data transmissions at the speed of light. Wraithly senses 
are too slow and entropy-bound to perceive this environment 
as it truly is, so riding the wires is a vortex of information and 
electrical flows transposed into a synesthetic fast-forward blur. 
Imprecise use of Wire Rider, or simply incautious navigation, 
can land the wraith far from Stygian-claimed territory. 

System: The wraith must have a material starting point 
and destination — while he can travel through wireless trans-
missions, he needs connected endpoints, even ones as simple 
as obsolete flip phones. The player spends 2 Pathos and rolls 
Dexterity + Inhabit (difficulty 7). Successes determine maxi-
mum distance of travel:
1 success 
2 successes  Same city or local power grid
3 successes  Same national power grid or telecommunication 

Line of sight or local cellular tower’s range

network

4 successes  Same continent or satellites in low orbit
5 successes  Global or satellites in geosynchronous orbit
•••• The Tool Knows Its Master (Initiate)

Elder Artificers fear few weapons wrought by the hands of 
the Quick or the dead. This art infuses an object with a portion 
of the wraith’s own essence, compelling it to act as if it were 
one with his Corpus — and what rebel portion of his own body 
would willingly harm the greater part? 

System: The wraith must touch the object (material or 
relic) he wants to affect. The player spends 2 Pathos and rolls 
Dexterity + Inhabit (difficulty 7). For a number of scenes equal 
to successes rolled, anything or anyone touching the object is 
considered to be in contact with the wraith for the purposes 
of his own Arcanoi — effectively, he can channel his touch 
through the object when using his arts. 

In  addition,  if  the  object  would  damage  his  Corpus,  its 
base damage rating is considered 0 (though extra successes on 
an attack roll add damage normally). The wraith may use this 
art  reflexively  on  a  weapon  as  it  strikes  him.  The  difficulty 
increases to 8 for a melee weapon or 9 for a ranged attack, but 
success takes effect before that attack deals damage.
••••• Empower (Common)

A wraith skilled in this art can imbue a relic with one of 
his Arcanoi, creating a temporary Artifact. While this power 
lasts, other wraiths who know the command to activate the 
relic’s power can invoke the art it contains.

System: The player rolls Strength + Inhabit (difficulty 8, 
+1 if the relic is thematically inappropriate for the Arcanos to 

174

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

be placed in it). The number of successes indicate the highest-
rated art the Artificer may invest in the relic. 

The player then selects a single art the wraith knows and 
pays that art’s activation cost one or more times (including gain-
ing any temporary Angst). If the art normally has no activation 
cost, it costs 1 Pathos for this purpose. If the art normally is 
always active, it costs 1 Pathos per day of use. This expenditure 
“fuels” the relic for the appropriate number of uses of that art. 
Finally, the player spends 1 Corpus and 1 Willpower to “seal” 
the newly created Artifact and chooses a word, phrase, gesture, 
or other command that activates the Empowered art.

Anyone who knows the Artifact’s activation command may 
spend 1 Willpower and use the command to invoke the art it 
contains. If the art normally is always active, each invocation 
instead activates it for one day. The user pays no additional 
Pathos, Corpus, or Willpower — those costs were paid when 
the Artificer created the Artifact. However, if the art bestows 
temporary Angst, the user’s Shadow receives those points. The 
user’s dice pool for the Empowered art is normal, though she 
may substitute her Occult Ability for the appropriate Arcanos. 
Once all Empowered applications of the art are used, the Artifact 
becomes a normal relic again.

There is no way to “recharge” an Empowered item, save 

for a second invocation of this art.

Example:  Vincent  knows  Wayfarer’s  Resolve,  an  ancient 
Argos •• art. He wants to place this art into a relic St. Christopher 
medallion (invoking the Catholic patron saint of travelers). Vincent’s 
player rolls Strength + Inhabit against a difficulty of 8, gaining three 
successes. This is sufficient to imbue a three-dot art and more than 
enough for the intended two-dot art. 

In normal use, Wayfarer’s Resolve has no activation cost and is 
always active. Vincent’s player decides to spend 7 Pathos to empower 
the Artifact for seven days of use, then spends an additional 1 Corpus 
and 1 Willpower to finish the Empowerment.

Vincent gives the medallion to Monique and tells her its ac-
tivation phrase, (a Latin prayer for St. Christopher’s protection). 
At any time — but hopefully not until she’s in the Tempest, where 
Wayfarer’s Resolve is most useful — Monique can speak this prayer 
and activate the Empowered art for one day. She can do this a total 
of seven times before the medallion’s power is used up.
••••• Compel the Soulsteel (Initiate)

One of the Artificers’ Guild’s less pleasant aspects is the work 
it’s done over centuries of turning once-living souls into material 
goods. Common wisdom holds that soulforged wraiths are no 
longer conscious (if the smith was competent, anyway…), but 
this art brings that comforting thought into question. Compel the 
Soulsteel allows a wraith to draw knowledge from the soul that 
comprises a soulforged item. Whether this is mere psychometry 
or actual communication with a fragment of someone’s trapped 
consciousness is an ongoing, bitter debate in Artificer circles.
System: The player spends 3 Pathos and rolls Strength + 
Inhabit (difficulty 8). Each success allows the wraith to ask one 
question of the target item. If the soul that was forged into the 
item knows the answer, the character receives a brief vision 
or a moaned response. The soul can’t lie or dissemble, though 
it only answers each question to the limits of its own residual 
memories.  Compel  the  Soulsteel  can  only  be  used  once  on 
any soulforged item, ever, and each question asked grants the 
querent’s Shadow 1 point of temporary Angst.

Solicitors

ntimation  is  the  subtle  but  potentially 
devastating  power  to  manipulate  desire. 
With  this  Arcanos’  arts,  a  wraith  can

urges,  or  turn  fervent  motivation 
into  crushing  lethargy.  A  master 
Solicitor can so completely subvert 

ter of survival.
Guildmarks

her target’s will that only monstrous, programmed 
obsessions remain.

According  to  Solicitor  and  Pardoner  lore, 

Intimation  arose  from  primitive  attempts  to 
understand  and  influence  the  Shadow.  The 
relationship  between  Intimation  and  Cas-
tigate is one neither guild likes its clients 
to examine too closely, but the Arcanoi 
do share a common origin. Where they 
diverge  is  in  focus.  While  Castigate 
uses  the  Shadow’s  desires  to  tame 
that  particular  shard  of  Oblivion, 
Intimation focuses on the desires of 
both the Shadow and the Psyche for 
their own sake.

Extreme applications of Intimation 

are nothing less than brainwashing. Even 
its minor arts can be profoundly unnerving if 
a self-aware target realizes that a sudden urge 
is of alien origin. It’s easy to apply in ways that 
gratify someone’s Shadow, whether the Solici-
tor’s or the target’s, and a Shadow in control of 
a  Psyche  with  access  to  Intimation  is  profoundly 
dangerous. Because its effects are subtle and corrosive, 
particularly when the Shadow holds the reins, it may be 
the Arcanos most likely to give Oblivion an unnoticed 
foothold in a wraith’s mind. Between the ease of abuse 
and the disquieting tendency of self-serving practitioners to 
become Spectres, known Solicitors have few friends and only 
the limited trust that they can build (or create) themselves. For 

Circles that count a Solicitor among their number, reciprocal 
checks for strange behavior aren’t paranoia — they’re a mat-

Every Solicitor’s left eye has a glimmer of toxic green 
fire that grows as her mastery of Intimation increases. 
It’s normally the approximate luminosity of a candle, 
but  when  she  actively  uses  an  Intimation  art,  it 
brightens to momentary incandescence, sufficient 
for reading (if anyone wants to read by it). It’s pos-
sible to cover or hood this light — the Stygian 
fashion for masks certainly enables it — but 
such deception is itself cause for suspicion 

among knowledgeable wraiths.

Since the 15th century, the Solici-
tors’  Guild  has  used  a  stylized  Cath-
erine wheel as its sigil, invoking the 
symbolism of breaking a victim’s will. 
Modern  Solicitors  don’t  advertise 
their skills frequently, but they cer-
tainly use jewelry or accessories with 
a wheel motif for mutual identification 
or  subtle  intimidation.  For  more  overt 
effect, a Solicitor conducting a long-term 
campaign against a particular target will ar-
range for small wheels to be rolled past him at 

distracting moments.
The Guild
Never a large organization, the Solicitors’ Guild 
has always been intertwined with the decadent and con-
spiratorial elements of Stygian nobility. Its first known 
political  dabbling  came  through  a  circle  of  Athenian 
Guildwraiths who set a price for determining the outcome 
of necropolitan political deliberations. Since then, it’s made 
its reputation and fortune as a tool of intrigue and influence 
— and, at times, served less as kingmaker than as ruler in both

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

name and fact. Intimation’s capacity to affect both deathless and mortal personalities made it 
a valued resource, not only for wraiths who sought power in the Underworld but also those 
with interests in mortal politics, economics, or theology.

Solicitor power reached its brief zenith at the end of the War of the Guilds, when the Black 
Death created a massive influx of new wraiths in the Shadowlands and triggered far-reaching 
upheavals across Europe. Business for Solicitors was brisk, as any titled wraith of note sought 
advantage over his peers. Distracted by the Skeletal Legion’s sudden surge in power, Stygian 
authorities failed to regulate Solicitor excesses. The emboldened Guild saw a chance to seize 
the reins of power on a massive scale and turned on its patrons — not in a sweeping conspiracy, 
as its enemies later portrayed, but in 1,000 personal betrayals and power plays that encouraged 
and fed one another when the involved Solicitors weren’t acting at cross purposes.

Had the effort truly been organized, the result may have been the Guilds, led by 

the Solicitors, successfully breaking away from Stygian authority a century before 
the Artificers’ ill-fated attempt at a coup. As it was, the Solicitors suffered the fate 
of any tool that turns in Stygia’s hand. Judging them too dangerous and unreliable 
to tolerate, Charon and the Deathlords outlawed them and the practice of their 
art. A concerted campaign of slander, led by the Legions and the Pardoners’ 
Guild, ensured that most wraiths quickly came to mistrust and fear the Solicitors.
The Solicitors who survived their betrayals’ consequences did so by forming 
the very conspiracy of which they’d previously been innocent. Abandoning 
contact with their former patrons, they turned their attention to the remain-
ing Guilds, seeing them as a means of exacting revenge on the Deathlords. 
The events of the Guilds’ subsequent overreach are well-documented…

Factions
The modern Solicitors’ Guild is more secret society and social orga-
nization than trade guild, with elaborate initiation rituals (and attendant 
use of Intimation) to ensure new inductees’ loyalty and co-opt would-be 
spies. Competition for prestige and influence is cutthroat, with only 
one ironclad law: Thou shalt not use Intimation on accepted Guildmates. 
The Spoke of Leo enforces this dictum ruthlessly and without regard 
for rank. It also pursues knowledge of the Shadow and Spectres. The 
vindictive Spoke of Aries maintains endless ledgers of Stygian offenses 
real and imagined. Its leaders carefully tend their ancient grudges and 
keep  their  subordinates  tirelessly  working  to  infiltrate  the  Legions  to 
disrupt Hierarchy affairs. Conversely, members of the Spoke of Capricorn 
see the Skinlands as a giant game board and count their achievements in 
mortal affairs bent to their whims. Solicitors who still ply their Arcanos 
commercially are drawn to the Spoke of Taurus and count their wealth in 
favors owed and wraiths bent to their will. The Spoke of Pisces maintains 
the Solicitors’ few remaining connections with other Guilds and broader 
society, particularly the Pardoners’ Guild and the Silent Legion. They’re 
the Solicitors most likely to be willing to undo others’ work for the right 
price, but also those most likely to be behind Heretic personality cults.

At heart, the Solicitors remain a cabal of political meddlers. Wraiths 
who learn enough Guild lore often wonder how far Solicitor control of the 
Underworld really extends. However, the Solicitors’ Guild has always been 
its own worst enemy. An organization capable of manipulating desire in all 
its forms attracts personalities with strong desires of their own who refuse 
to sublimate their wants and needs to a greater agenda. Powerful Solici-
tors have suborned individual Necropoli, whispered poisoned honey into 
Legionnaires’ ears, or become the secret masters behind Heretic cults, but 
none of their grand conspiracies reach beyond local power. A charismatic 
leader who could unify the Solicitors behind her own plans would shake

the pillars of Stygia. Fortunately for the Hierarchy, no one has 
yet aligned the factions’ figureheads without succumbing to the 
temptation to use Intimation on fellow Guildwraiths. In fact, 
the Spoke of Leo has been remarkably adept at exposing and 
destroying such would-be demagogues for a very long time…

•• Excise (Common)

Intimation
Intimation Systems

• 

Unless otherwise noted, the difficulty of any Intimation-
related roll is the target’s Willpower. This has two broad exceptions:
•  Arts that affect a wraith’s Shadow use the higher of the 
wraith’s Willpower or the Shadow’s permanent Angst.
Intimation can work across the Shroud to affect both the 
Quick and the World of Darkness’ other denizens. In such 
cases, the difficulty is the higher of the target’s Willpower 
or the local Shroud rating.
All uses of Intimation on another character require the 
Solicitor to have clear line of sight to her target’s eyes (though 
mutual eye contact is not necessary).
• Impulse (Common)

Immediate desires are the easiest for a Solicitor to gauge. 
With a casual glance at a subject, the wraith can discern the 
desire that’s uppermost in his mind at the moment. This isn’t 
always immediately useful information — “I wish I had a pony” 
isn’t terribly actionable — but it can give an advantage in tight 
negotiations or con jobs.

System: The player rolls Manipulation + Intimation. With 
success, the Solicitor becomes aware of the target’s strongest 
current desire. Additional successes provide more detail on the 
desire’s focus and causes. If the desire in question is a Passion or 
Dark Passion, the Solicitor identifies it as such, and additional 
successes provide deeper insight into the Passion’s focus.
• Know Thyself (Initiate)

The Solicitors’ Guild forbids its members to use Intima-
tion on one another, with the full weight of Oblivion levied 
against offenders. The most common of the Guild’s secret arts 
ensures  that  any  Solicitor  worthy  of  the  name  knows  when 
she’s been subject to Intimation and strengthens her defenses 
against it. This art also provides some benefit against certain 
other Arcanoi and Dark Arcanoi.

System: The Solicitor always knows when another wraith 
has used an Intimation art on her — no roll is necessary. When-
ever this occurs, the player may spend 1 Pathos to roll Wits + 
Intimation (difficulty of the aggressor’s dice pool for the art in 
question). Each success negates one of the aggressor’s successes.
Know Thyself also can be used to defend against uses of Cas-
tigate and Contaminate, albeit at lesser potency (and it provides 
no automatic awareness of these Arcanoi unless the Solicitor 
also knows Adrestia’s Communion). Every two successes on the 
Wits + Intimation roll negates one of the aggressor’s successes.

Excise removes a want from its target. The affected desire 
can be as simple as a thirst for another beer or as complex as 
a five-dot Passion to restore the Roman Empire to its rightful 
place of global power. This art neither softens nor rationalizes 
its effects. The subject’s behavioral changes are obvious, while 
the  subject  himself  remembers  his  former  desire  but  can  no 
longer find any motivation to pursue it.

System: To permanently remove an ordinary desire, the 
player spends 2 Pathos and rolls Manipulation + Intimation. The 
number of successes determines the complexity and strength of 
desire Excise can remove. One success is sufficient to make the 
victim disinterested in that beer, but curing alcoholism would 
require five or more. If the victim is unwilling, the Solicitor’s 
Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst.

To  temporarily  suppress  a  Passion,  the  player  spends  3 
Pathos and rolls Manipulation + Intimation. Every three suc-
cesses reduce the Passion by one dot. Lost dots return in full 
after a number of days equal to the Solicitor’s dots in Intima-
tion. If the victim is unwilling, the Solicitor’s Shadow gains 
1 temporary Angst per dot of Passion suppressed. If a target’s 
Passion is reduced to zero in this manner, it cannot be used to 
acquire Pathos. Also, it is impossible for this art to be used to 
remove a Passion permanently.
•• Launch a Thousand Ships (Initiate)

Turning her art inward, the Solicitor makes herself an object 
of  desire.  Observers’  reactions  range  from  sexual  fixation  to 
artistic appreciation, depending on their individual ideals. First 
impressions are more favorable, performance art becomes more 
memorable, and charm and seduction have devastating effects. 
System: The player spends 2 Pathos. For the rest of the 
scene, the Solicitor adds her dots in Intimation to her Appear-
ance, even if this raises the Attribute above 5. 
••• Unfold the Animal Heart (Common)

The wraith can peer deep into a target’s psyche, mapping 
his wants and needs in detail. Though other Intimation arts may 
be more potent, this one made the Solicitors’ reputation and 

INTIMATE ISSUES

Even  for  a  game  as  emotion-focused  as 
Wraith, Intimation is potentially problematic. Its 
arts can easily demonize characters — or, worse, 
raise uncomfortable issues of control and trust 
for players. Storytellers should allow Intimation 
into their games only if all parties are comfort-
able with its effects and implications. Storytellers 
should feel comfortable declaring specific effects 
of Intimation out of bounds, or barring it from 
their games entirely.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

drove their centuries of involvement with Stygian potentates’ 
machinations.

System:  The  player  spends  2  Pathos  and  rolls  Wits  + 
Intimation. One success reveals the target’s Nature. Each ad-
ditional success reveals one of his Passions, starting with the 
highest rated. If all Passions are revealed in this fashion, then 
additional successes display one of his desires that isn’t mechani-
cally represented as a Passion.

If the target is currently controlled by his Shadow, this art 
instead  reveals  the  Shadow’s  Archetype  and  Dark  Passions. 
In addition, the Solicitor’s Shadow gains 2 temporary Angst.
••• Apple of Discord (Initiate)

One of Intimation’s less-subtle arts, Apple of Discord applies 
an aura of desirability to a material object or relic. The item’s 
physical appearance doesn’t change but it evokes an acquisitive 
or possessive response in observers. This can trigger a schism 
within an affected group, as in the eponymous legend, or can 
be an “I win” button for a wraithly snake oil vendor.

System:  The  player  spends  1  Pathos  and  rolls  Wits  + 
Intimation  (difficulty  7  for  a  target  on  the  same  side  of  the 

Shroud, otherwise difficulty of the local Shroud). For the rest 
of the scene, any other wraith near the ensorcelled object must 
succeed in a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) or gain a temporary 
but functional Passion focused on acquiring and protecting the 
object. This Passion’s value is equal to the number of successes 
rolled. Characters who aren’t susceptible to Passions (i.e., non-
wraiths) must succeed in the same roll or gain an obsession 
derangement focused on the object. Any Passion or derangement 
gained through this art fades at the end of the scene.
•••• Ignite (Common)

This art implants a complex desire for anything, ranging 
from really good food to total conquest of all Bohemian Ne-
cropoli. This artificial drive becomes the obsessive centerpiece 
of the victim’s existence. Like Excise, Ignite is unsubtle and 
psychically  violent.  Its  behavioral  effects  are  obvious  to  the 
victim and all around him.

System:  The  player  precisely  describes  the  craving  she 
wants to create, then spends 4 Pathos and rolls Manipulation 
+ Intimation. The roll’s difficulty is modified by the desire’s 
complexity and the effort required to satisfy it:

TRAITS

Trivial (eat French food, fold a dozen paper airplanes)
Routine (visit Paris, keep up routine maintenance  
on a small plane)
Problematic (gain fluency in French, rebuild a radial  
engine without a manual)
Exhausting (become a French foreign policy expert,  
rebuild a salvaged warbird)
Nigh Impossible (conquer France, design and build  
an airliner)

With one success, the Solicitor can implant a desire that 
naturally  follows  the  subject’s  existing  inclinations.  With 
three successes, she can create a desire unrelated to his natu-
ral interests. With five successes, she can build a desire that’s 
uncharacteristic of his normal behavior, so long as it doesn’t 
oppose his Nature or lead obviously to Oblivion. The Solicitor’s 
Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst per success. The implanted 
desire lasts until the victim satisfies it or a number of weeks 
equal to the Solicitor’s Willpower, whichever comes first. Ignite 
is responsible for many of the ghost stories of strange, sudden 
manias afflicting residents of haunted houses, and wraiths who 
attempt to intervene against a desire implanted in this way may 
find themselves dealing with an unexpectedly violent reaction.
Ignite can’t create a Passion, nor can its victim gain Pathos 

from following the implanted desire.

If  the  target’s  Shadow  is  in  control  when  the  Solicitor 
uses this art, the Shadow, not the Psyche, gains the desire. The 
Solicitor’s Shadow still gains 1 temporary Angst per success.
•••• Two Fires (Initiate)

Sufficient understanding of a subject’s Passions allows the 
Solicitor to bind them to her own Psyche. In doing so, she and 
her subject benefit from each other’s emotional experiences. 
Most elder Solicitors maintain entire Circles of Passion-bound 
wraiths, ensuring a constant supply of Pathos.

System:  The  player  selects  one  of  her  target’s  Passions, 
spends 4 Pathos, and rolls Wits + Intimation. With success, the 
Solicitor gains one dot per success in the target Passion, with a 
maximum rating one less than that which the target possesses 
(e.g., if the target has the Passion at •••, the Solicitor can’t 
gain it higher than ••). The target’s own Passion is reduced 
by one dot.

These  effects  last  for  one  day  per  dot  of  the  Solicitor’s 
Willpower. While Two Fires is in effect, whenever one of the 
characters gains any amount of Pathos from the affected Pas-
sion, the other also gains one point of Pathos.

If the target’s Shadow is in control when the Solicitor uses 
this art, she must select one of that Shadow’s Dark Passions, which 

she gains as a normal Passion. Whenever her target’s Shadow 
gains Angst from the affected Dark Passion, she gains one point 
of Pathos and her Shadow gains one point of temporary Angst.
••••• A Single Thread (Common)

The culmination of the Solicitor’s art, A Single Thread is 
an insidious power that can elevate the ordinary and cripple 
the mighty. The wraith can rewrite a target’s desires so subtly 
that  even  close  friends  and  the  victim  himself  perceive  the 
changes in the victim’s psyche as a natural progression. At the 
same time, the range of possible changes expands to violent 
shifts in personality and obvious roads to Oblivion.

System: The art duplicates the basic effects of Excise and 
Ignite, using their normal dice pools. However, in place of those 
arts’ usual costs, each use of A Single Thread costs 4 Pathos 
and 2 Willpower, and all gains in temporary Angst increase by 
2. In addition, with more than five successes, the Solicitor can 
enact changes that directly oppose the subject’s Nature or that 
are overtly self-destructive.

Successful use of A Single Thread is undetectable unless 
someone  specifically  assesses  the  victim  for  signs  of  outside 
influence, a process requiring extensive psychotherapy or self-
examination. Even then, introspection requires the victim to 
beat the Solicitor’s successes with an Intelligence + Eidolon 
roll (difficulty of the Solicitor’s Willpower) to detect signs of 
tampering. An outside examination must beat the Solicitor’s 
successes with an Intelligence + Empathy roll (difficulty of the 
Solicitor’s Willpower).
••••• Adrestia’s Communion (Initiate)

While no wraith reaches true accommodation with her 
Shadow, a Solicitor who knows this art understands what her 
darker half wants. Moreover, she can apply the same knowledge 
to others’ Shadows, extending the reach of her Intimation to 
them. The price of such dark knowledge is a few more steps 
toward Oblivion’s precipice.

System:  The  Solicitor  can  use  any  Intimation  art  on  a 
target wraith’s Shadow, even if that Shadow isn’t currently in 
control. Each use of Intimation on a non-dominant Shadow 
grants the Solicitor’s own Shadow 1 temporary Angst in addi-
tion to all normal costs.

Additionally, the Solicitor can apply Intimation to her own 
Shadow, though this is fraught with peril. Her Shadow always 
resists with its permanent Angst, and if it rolls more successes, 
it immediately takes control for the rest of the scene.

When the Solicitor learns this art, her own Shadow gains 

1 permanent Angst.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Chanteurs

usic, the Quick say, has charms to soothe 
a  savage  breast.  In  the  Skinlands,  this 
is  a  romantic  fantasy,  but  the  Restless 
understand  music’s  power  to  stir  the 
emotions and provoke people to action. 
Keening  draws  upon  this  power, 
allowing those who understand it to 

make music that provides a soothing balm for the soul 
— or strikes their enemies as lethally as any blade.

Guildmarks
The Chanteurs’ guildmark is aural rather 

than visible. If a wraith stands near a Chanteur 
and listens carefully, he can hear some ver-
sion of the Chanteur’s favorite song in life 
(or some other song with deep meaning 
for her) playing faintly, almost as if the 
Chanteur  has  her  own  soundtrack. 
Any significant noise, including any 
use of a Keening art, drowns out this 
background music (unless the wraith 
succeeds with a Perception + Awareness 
roll against difficulty 9), but it never goes 
away completely.

Many Chanteurs also like to travel with 

some form of musical instrument or instrument 
iconography — a relic guitar, perhaps, or a brooch 
in  the  shape  of  a  harp.  These  are  affectations, 
however, and are more likely to be found on wan-
nabes and followers of true Chanteurs than on the 
genuine article.
The Guild

Given their tendency toward creative individualism, 

the Chanteurs didn’t consolidate as a Guild for a long time. 
Even then the primary motivation (aside from shared love of 
music) was the need for “defense” against other Guilds, not any 

desire to work together. As solo performers or small Circles they 
pursued their art in their own way, often taking advantage of 
their popularity as entertainers to gain access to (and influence 

in) the highest levels of Underworld society.

But in the years leading up to the revolt, the Chanteurs 
found their influence waning in the face of other forces. 
Some of the most powerful Chanteurs — including a few 
whose names the Quick still revere, such as Taliesin 
the Bright and Homer, composer of epics — took it 
upon themselves to combat the problem by found-
ing the Guild proper. This “Council of Poets,” as 
it soon became known, used logic, persuasion, 
and sometimes bribery to win many Chan-
teurs to its cause, but others rejected their 
overtures. Stubbornly refusing to give up 
their independence, these “Nightingales” 
sometimes actively worked against the 
Council or disrupted its attempts to 
band the Chanteurs together. Ironi-
cally,  since  they  often  had  to  work 
together  against  the  Council,  the 
Nightingales evolved into an organiza-
tion themselves, and this was the key to 

their undoing.

The  Council  challenged  the  Nightin-
gales’ leaders to a musical competition, with the 
winning side to determine how the Chanteurs 
would move forward. The Nightingales, convinced 
their “freedom” meant they had the greater artistry, 
agreed. But a panel of Anacreon judges unanimously 
gave the Council the laurel wreath. Legend claims the 
Council won because its most talented quartet traveled 
to a place where two great Byways crossed to learn secret 
music of surpassing beauty from a mysterious, dark spirit 
— but if asked, any Chanteur will either deny or laugh at 

this explanation.

TRAITS

181

With the competition done, most Nightingales joined the 
guild. But the nascent group had barely established itself when the 
Artificers touched off the revolt against Charon. 
Romantics almost to a wraith, the Chanteurs 
couldn’t help but join the noble struggle — 
whether it led to glorious victory or was a 
doomed cause from the start, it would inspire 
great songs. Few Chanteurs fought on the 
front lines of the revolt. Instead, from their 
positions in the courts of the Anacreons 
and homes of the wealthy, they wielded 
their influence as a weapon to mis-
direct anti-rebel efforts, or served 
as  spies  for  the  Guilds’  cause. 
Many Chanteurs played their 
parts so well that even after 
the  Breaking  they  were 
still  able  to  subtly  sway 
the great and powerful on 
the isle.

Since then the Chan-
teurs have mostly focused 
on their artistic and com-
mercial pursuits rather than 
political machinations. But 
they  know  how  the  world 
works, so they keep their feet 
on the ground even if their heads 
are often in the clouds. And who knows when 
another cause may fan the heroic fires that 
burn in most Chanteurs’ souls into a blaze 
that drives them to action?

Factions
From  some  perspectives,  the  Guild  of 
Chanteurs is nothing but factions — often 
factions composed of a single Circle (usually 
known as “bands,” “troupes,” “orchestras,” or 
the like). The Guild has authority in matters 
of  interest  to  all  Chanteurs,  and  arbitrates 
disputes among its members, but only an event 
of  major  significance  gets  the  Chanteurs  to 
work together in true Guild fashion.

Some of the differences of perspective or 
practice  that  divide  the  Chanteurs  include: 
the Troubadours, ever eager for information, 
some of which they pass on through song and 
story, some of which they keep for themselves; 
the  Outcasts,  whose  music  emphasizes  rebel-
lion, discontent, and anger at “the system;” the 
Romantics, who believe music can lead to love, 
tranquility, and ultimately Transcendence; the 
Hadean  Symphony,  whose  members  seek  to 
create elaborate musical performances (often 

using bizarre instruments), and who often serve as leaders of the 
Guild; the Hard Corps, who wield music as a weapon against 
Oblivion and its creatures; the Jesters, or “Comedians,” who work 
Keening through humor rather than music; and the Sanguine 
Chorus, a network of Chanteur spies. It’s not uncommon for a 
Chanteur to cycle through several factions over the course of 
her unlife as her philosophy of music and existence changes.

Keening

Keening Systems

Keening  is  a  broadly  focused  Arcanos,  able 
to affect or create nearly any emotion in the right 
circumstances.  While  Chanteurs  have  an  easier 
time dealing with negative emotions, their songs 
can bring joy, inspire courage, or plant the 
seeds of love in a wraith’s heart.

Most  Keening  involves  singing  and 
playing instruments, but Chanteurs don’t 
have to make music to use Keening’s arts. 
Some Chanteurs work through dance, acting, 
humor, mime, or other forms of performance in 
which music isn’t a part. This is not commonly 
known, and Chanteurs who can use other forms 
of expression to channel their powers often find 
themselves with a significant tactical advantage.
Gaining  Pathos  from  emotions  elicited 
by Keening is difficult, since they’re artificial. 
The difficulty is 9, or 8 for wraiths who have 
three  or  more  dots  in  Keening.  It  is  said 
that Pathos garnered from this source feels 
somehow blander and more artificial than 
that  gathered  naturally,  though  younger 
Chanteurs dismiss this as the grumbling of 
old fuddy-duddies who are too hidebound 
to seek emotion of their own.

Failed Keening rolls can create emo-
tional “feedback,” meaning the Chanteur’s 
Shadow may gain 1 temporary Angst from 
the discord.

Keening powers can be applied across 
the Shroud at an additional difficulty of 
the current Shroud rating –4.
• Hearing Voices (Common)

The Chanteur can make it seem as 
if his voice comes from a nearby person 
or object rather than himself.

System: Hearing Voices costs 1 
Pathos. The player rolls Manipula-
tion + Keening (difficulty 7). On 
a success, the wraith may make his 
voice seem to come from an object 

182

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

up  to  10  feet  away  (plus  two  feet  per  success).  Determining 
the true source of the voice requires a Perception + Awareness 
roll that achieves more successes than the Hearing Voices roll.
• Sotto Voce (Initiate)

The cleverest Chanteurs can hide their powers in ordinary 

song or conversation.

System: Sotto Voce costs 1 Pathos. The player rolls Ma-
nipulation + Keening (difficulty 6). If he succeeds, his use of 
Keening seems like ordinary music or speech. Any wraith that 
has even one dot in any Keening power can perceive the truth 
if he achieves more successes on a Perception + Keening roll 
than the Chanteur achieved on her Sotto Voce roll.
•• Mood Music (Common)

One of the basic arts of the Chanteur is to evoke emotions 
through music. “Dark” emotions are easier to appeal to than 
lighter ones, but a skilled Chanteur can create joy almost as 
easily as sorrow.

System: To create a “negative” emotion — for example, 
despair, fear, self-loathing, hatred, envy, bitterness, jealousy, or 
anger — the Chanteur must spend 1 Pathos. The player rolls 
Charisma + Keening (difficulty 7), with the number of successes 
indicating the depth and duration of the feeling evoked: 1 day per 
success for one of the Quick, one hour per success for a wraith.
To create a “positive” emotion — such as hope, love, cour-
age, happiness, or tranquility — the Chanteur must spend 2 
Pathos. The player rolls Manipulation + Keening (difficulty 8), 
using the same depth and duration rules as negative emotions. 
These  emotions  can  be  used  to  trigger  Passions  —  or  Dark 
Passions — as the situation warrants.
•• Cacophony (Initiate)

The Chanteur’s discordant playing and singing deafens and 

disorients everyone near her and disrupts other Keening arts.
System:  The  Chanteur  pays  2  Pathos.  If  she  uses  Ca-
cophony to disrupt another wraith’s Keening, she also acquires 
1 temporary Angst.

The player rolls Manipulation + Keening (difficulty 7). The 
number of successes indicates two things. The first is the number 
of turns anyone within hearing range is deafened and disoriented. 
This inflicts a +1 difficulty penalty on most rolls, and may make 
some actions (such as communicating by speech) impossible. Sec-
ond, if another Chanteur is using some other Keening art within 
hearing distance, if the successes with Cacophony equal or exceed 
his successes with the art he’s using, that art immediately ceases to 
have any effect. If the other Chanteur wants to reestablish it he has 
to pay any cost again, use another action, and restart his attempt.
A Chanteur cannot use Cacophony with Sotto Voce.

••• Satire (Common)

assets she has — and this art can strip them from her in the 
time it takes to sing a song. The Chanteur composes a song or 
story that casts a particular wraith in a negative light (either 
for some specific sin, or in general), plays it to an audience, and 
then sits back to watch the subject’s social standing evaporate 
as fast as gossip can spread.

System: The wraith spends 2 Pathos to use Satire. Addi-
tionally, if the Chanteur later discovers the subject genuinely 
didn’t deserve to be Satirized, she gains 1 temporary Angst.

The player rolls Charisma + Keening. The Storyteller sets 
the difficulty based on the subject’s popularity: Satirizing an 
unpopular  nobleman  or  Hierarchy  bureaucrat  is  difficulty  5, 
whereas trying to get the wraiths of a Necropolis to turn on a 
beloved centurion is difficulty 9 or 10. For every two successes 
achieved, the subject suffers the following effects:

He  gains  one  dot  of  Notoriety  based  on  whatever  the 

Chanteur’s song describes or accuses him of.

He loses one dot in Status (if he has any).
The difficulty of any rolls he makes involving Bureaucracy, 
Leadership, Politics, and any other ability the Storyteller deems 
relevant increases by 1.

Other problems may arise at the Storyteller’s discretion. For 
example, Allies and Contacts may shy away from the subject, 
wraiths may not attend his speeches or performances, or his 
circle may expel him.

The difficulties caused by Satire typically last one week 
per success (or until something happens that would negate the 
Satire’s effects, such as if a Legionnaire accused of cowardice 
demonstrates great bravery in public). But the Chanteur may 
suffer  difficulties  of  her  own  as  a  result,  since  few  powerful 
people take being Satirized lying down.
••• Siren Song (Initiate)

Some Chanteurs know a way to sing that attracts another 

wraith’s attention to them in an almost obsessive way.

System: The wraith spends 2 Pathos to use Siren Song. 
She must also have the opportunity to sing to the target, talk to 
him at length, or interact with him in some similar way. Siren 
Song only affects a single target even if the Chanteur performs 
to a large audience.

The player rolls Manipulation + Keening (difficulty of the 
target’s Willpower). The Chanteur receives extra dice equal 
to  the  number  of  successes  for  any  Social  Attribute-based 
rolls against the victim. Anyone else trying to make a Social 
Attribute-based roll against the victim loses a number of dice 
equal to the successes.

Siren Song’s effects last for one hour per dot the Chanteur 

has in Charisma.
•••• Crescendo (Common)

In  the  often  politically  charged  Underworld,  a  wraith’s 
influence and good reputation are among the most important 

Music is usually a gentle, subtle weapon, but not so this 
art, which uses the power of sound to damage plasm. The target 
has to be fairly close to the Chanteur to suffer the full effect, 

TRAITS

183

but the Chanteur screams a blast of music so loud that wraiths 
a mile away can hear it.

System: The wraith spends 3 Pathos and gains 1 tempo-
rary  Angst.  The  player  rolls  Charisma  +  Keening  (difficulty 
8). Each success inflicts one Corpus level of lethal damage to 
every wraith within normal hearing distance (other than the 
Chanteur herself).

If the Chanteur is Embodied, singing a Crescendo causes 
listeners to experience such intense fear that they take 1 health 
level of lethal damage per two successes.

A Chanteur cannot use Crescendo with Sotto Voce.

•••• Banshee (Initiate)

Ancient legends from the British Isles say that if you hear 
a banshee wail, you will soon die. Such stories may have arisen 
from Chanteurs’ use of this art, which inflicts painful injuries 
that don’t take effect until a specified condition occurs.

System: The wraith spends 3 Pathos and gains 1 temporary 
Angst. The player rolls Charisma + Keening (difficulty 8). Each 
success inflicts one Corpus level of aggravated damage to a victim 
who hears the Chanteur’s song, but the victim doesn’t actually 
take the damage until a condition specified by the Chanteur in 
that song occurs. The most common conditions are after the 
passage of a certain amount of time, after the victim takes a 
certain number of steps, or if the victim ever enters (or leaves) 
a defined location.

The Storyteller should veto any condition the Chanteur 
tries  to  impose  that’s  unbalancing  or  inappropriate  for  the 
chronicle. For example, “if you ever do anything I don’t like” 
often isn’t a legitimate condition, but “if you ever attack [my 
loved one]” might be.

A Chanteur who imposes a Banshee on someone can remove 
it at any time; this requires one turn in the victim’s presence 
and a point of Pathos. Many wraiths have tried other ways to 
get rid of a Banshee, but so far none of them has succeeded.
••••• Requiem (Common)

The Chanteur plays a song so profound that intense emo-
tions afflict the victim, preventing him from doing anything 
but suffer the psychological storm.

System: The wraith spends 3 Pathos, plus 1 Pathos per 
success, to use Requiem. He then chooses what emotion(s) to 
afflict the target with. If the emotions are especially “dark,” the 
Chanteur also gains 1 temporary Angst.

The player rolls Charisma + Keening (difficulty 7). A target 
who’s prepared for the attack can resist by rolling Willpower; 
otherwise  the  target  gets  no  defense.  Each  success  paralyzes 
the target for one turn; he’s so overcome with emotion that he 
cannot speak, move, use Arcanoi, or the like.

Especially strong Requiems inflict long-term harm on the 
target. If the Chanteur scores five or more successes using a 
“dark” emotion, the target loses one dot in a Mental Attribute 
chosen randomly by the Storyteller. If the emotions are “bright” 
or positive, the target becomes addicted to the rush and does 
whatever it takes to experience it once more.
••••• Out Of Tune (Initiate)

Like  a  Quick  opera  singer  breaking  a  glass  with  a  high 
note, this art allows a Chanteur to temporarily disrupt a wraith’s 
attunements.

System: While in the presence of either the target wraith 
or  the  person/object  the  target’s  attuned  to,  the  Chanteur 
spends 3 Pathos.

The player rolls Manipulation + Keening (difficulty 8). 
A target who’s attacked directly and is prepared can resist by 
rolling Willpower; otherwise the target gets no defense. Each 
success achieved weakens an attunement as follows:
•  With Embody, each success reduces the –3 difficulty reduc-
tion by 1 or reduces the reduction in Pathos or Corpus cost 
by 1 (Chanteur player’s choice).

•  With Inhabit, each success reduces the –2 difficulty reduc-

tion by 1.

•  With Puppetry, the Puppeteer must roll Willpower (dif-
ficulty 6) on a contested roll or be temporarily evicted from 
his current flesh suit.

•  With  other  Arcanoi,  the  Storyteller  decides  the  effects 

based on how attunement works in his chronicle.
The effects of Out Of Tune typically last for one day per 
success. The victim may cut this period short by spending the ap-
propriate amount of Willpower to reattune the person or object.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Monitors

The Guild

very wraith’s existence, at least in her initial 
Restless years, hinges on her connections to 
the living world. Early wraiths sought to 
understand or transcend their condition 
by studying these links. Understanding 
the bonds preventing Transcendence, 
reincarnation,  or  passage  to  a 

particular faith’s promised afterlife has always been a 
common goal. Over millennia of experimentation, 
scores  of  the  Restless  have  rediscovered  or 
spontaneously  recreated  Lifeweb,  the  Arcanos 
that grants awareness of a wraith’s ties to the 
living — and, with deeper study, enables her 
to  affect  both  her  own  connections  and 
those of other wraiths.

Basic  Lifeweb  techniques  focus 

on  the  links  between  a  Monitor  and 
her  Fetters.  Indeed,  the  uninitiated 
tend to think of Lifeweb as dealing 
exclusively in Fetters. Subtler and less 
common arts, however, allow the Moni-
tor to peer deeper into another wraith’s 
existence,  perceiving  Haunts,  mortal  as-
sociates, and even the memories the Quick 
hold of the subject. Such insight can provide 
early warning of threats to the things a wraith 
holds dear or unlock the self-awareness necessary 
for the first steps toward Transcendence. It also 
can reveal an enemy’s most closely held weaknesses.

The Monitors’ Guild has never distinguished itself by 
its claim to Lifeweb, but rather by the uses to which it puts 
its signature Arcanos. Like Lifeweb itself, organizations 
similar to today’s Monitors have arisen and disappeared 
repeatedly  throughout  Stygia’s  recorded  history.  The 
modern  Guild  traces  its  origin  to  the  early  Byzan-
tine Empire, when mortal turmoil reflected in the 
Shadowlands  made  it  difficult  for  many  wraiths 
to  personally  watch  over  Fetters  scattered  by 
the winds of change. The first Monitors offered 
their services exclusively to Stygian nobility’s 
upper ranks, but as the Guild swelled with 
apprentices,  it  eventually  welcomed  the 
oboli of the average wraith on the street.
Access to Imperial society’s high-
est strata offered many opportunities. 
When combined with ever-increasing 
refinements of Lifeweb’s oracular arts, 
the  temptation  to  intrigue  proved  ir-
resistible to many Monitors. The Guild 
rapidly insinuated itself into every aspect of 
Stygian politics. A faction without a Moni-
tor on retainer to blackmail its opponents or 
threaten their Fetters with destruction operated 
at  a  lethal  disadvantage.  From  there,  it  was  a 
short step for the Monitors to apply such leverage 
for their own agendas, abandoning their ostensible 

masters for the pursuit of personal or Guild power.

Guildmarks
Monitors never close their eyes. Ever.
Some  Monitors,  enamored  of  their  Arcanos’  sym-
bolism,  affect  styles  in  which  webs  and  spiders  feature 
prominently.  Older  Guildwraiths  find  this  gauche,  if  not 
a foolhardy taunt of the many Restless who hold prejudices 
against the Guild.

In the end, the Monitors went too far. Centuries 
of duplicity, threats, and intrusion left them with few 
friends in the guildhalls and fewer in the citadels. Many 
Stygian officials took the Breaking as an invitation to escape 
blackmail or worse, and fugitive Monitors found every door 
barred to them. Those who escaped the forges remained on 
the run far longer than most other Guildwraiths. Even today, 

TRAITS

185

Monitors are a paranoid lot, as ongoing misdeeds and abuses 
of Lifeweb perpetuate their historical reputation. 

Factions
Before  the  Breaking,  the  Monitors  were  a  multifaceted 
jewel of treachery and plotting, with the occasional shining 
altruist  or  plodding  tradesman  standing  aloof  from  the  100 
shifting factions. Survival imperatives erased many of these dif-
ferences during the years of flight. The modern Monitors’ Guild 
maintains few orders or established lodges, though members 
tend to coalesce around shared agendas, some of which they 
inherited from pre-Breaking factions. Mentors work to locate 
and Reap new wraiths and acclimate them to the Shadowlands, 
either  to  rebuild  the  Guild’s  reputation  through  good  works 
or to gain early leverage over fresh lemures. Marmarans carry 
on the Monitors’ unsavory tradition of political meddling, oc-
casionally  coalescing  into  short-lived  cabals  that  dissolve  in 
frenzies of backstabbing. Spinners try to stick to business, offering 
Lifeweb services and (rarely) instruction for hire. Tsuchigumo 
are  Lifeweb-empowered  petty  criminals,  running  protection 
rackets on other wraiths’ Fetters or linking victims to Fetters 
that are about to be destroyed.

• Vibrations in the Web (Initiate)

While Sense Strands focuses 
on the Monitor’s own Fetters, this 
complementary  art  extends  her 
perceptions  outward,  enabling 
her to perceive the connections 
between other wraiths and their 
Fetters.

System:  When  the 
Monitor  examines  another 
wraith,  the  player  spends  1 
Pathos and rolls Perception 
+  Lifeweb.  The  target  may 
resist with Willpower if he 
desires.  Each  net  success 
gives the Monitor one piece 
of information about one of 
the target’s Fetters: location, 
physical description, or emo-
tional significance to the target.

Lifeweb
Lifeweb Systems

Under normal circumstances, Fetters reside in the Skin-
lands, so when a Lifeweb art affects a Fetter, the difficulty is the 
Shroud rating at that Fetter’s location. If the Fetter somehow 
winds up in the Underworld, the difficulty is as follows. If it’s 
in the Shadowlands, 7; if it’s in the Tempest 8, and 9 if it’s in 
the Labyrinth, closest to Oblivion.

Even the subtlest Lifeweb uses can have an observer effect, 
potentially warning the target that the Monitor is examining 
him.  When  a  wraith  is  subject  to  any  Lifeweb  art  that  isn’t 
immediately  obvious  through  other  means,  he  may  make  a 
Perception + Awareness roll, difficulty 7. One success alerts him 
to the fact that someone’s toying with part of his being. With 
three or more successes, he identifies the Monitor as the source.
• Sense Strands (Common)

The Monitor develops a constant intuitive awareness of 
her Fetters’ locations. By concentrating on one, she can extend 
her perceptions to its immediate vicinity.

System: Once the wraith learns this art, she always knows 

where her Fetters are. No roll is necessary. 

When the Monitor extends her senses to one of her Fetters, 
the player rolls Perception + Lifeweb. Each success on this roll 
allows her to use one die of her normal Perception + Alertness 
pool to survey the Fetter’s location. 

If the player spends 1 Pathos when activating this art, she 
also may assess the Fetter’s location with a Perception + Aware-
ness roll, subject to the same dice pool limit.

The Monitor also may exam-

ine an object or person to deter-
mine if it is a Fetter. Again, the 
player spends 1 Pathos and rolls 
Perception  +  Lifeweb.  Each 
net success gives the Moni-
tor one piece of information 
about one wraith who has 
the  target  as  a  Fetter: 
location,  physical  de-
scription,  or  emotional 
relationship  with  the 
Fetter. If the Monitor is trying 
to determine whether the subject is a 
Fetter for a particular wraith, this is the 
first piece of information she gleans.
•• Strand Channel (Common)

The wraith can extend her presence 
to a Fetter, channeling her voice and 
Arcanoi as if she were standing beside it.
System: The player spends 2 Pa-
thos and rolls Intelligence + Lifeweb. 
For one turn per success, the wraith 
may use any Arcanos art she knows 
as if she were at the Fetter’s loca-
tion (though she may still use them 
normally at her own location if she 
so  chooses).  She  also  may  speak 
through the Fetter, with her voice 
seeming to originate from it.

If the wraith isn’t already using 
Sense Strands to perceive her Fet-

186

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

ter’s location, every two successes on the roll to activate Strand 
Channel count as one success for Sense Strands. This applies 
even if the Monitor doesn’t know Sense Strands.
•• Movement in the Web (Initiate)

Once  the  Monitor  learns  to  perceive  the  energy  traces 
that bind the Restless to their Fetters, she can refine this sense 
to uncover more subtle relationships between the wraith and 
the  world  of  the  Quick.  Movement  in  the  Web  reveals  the 
emotional resonance between a given wraith and the collective 
minds of humanity.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and makes a resisted 
Perception + Lifeweb roll against the target’s Willpower. Each 
success reveals one key fact about one of the target’s Backgrounds 
that involves a connection to the living. Typically, these will 
be mortal Allies, Contacts, or Mentors, a Haunt, a Legacy, or 
Memoriam. If the scrutinized wraith has none of these Back-
grounds, that’s useable information, too…
••• Splice Strand (Common)

From  sensing  and  using  existing  Fetters,  the  Monitor 
moves to building new connections to the world of the Quick. 
Through intense concentration and physical contact with a 
person, place, or thing, she can establish a temporary Fetter 
bond with it — or between it and another wraith.

System: The character first touches the living being, place, 
or  material  object  that  she  wants  to  make  into  a  temporary 
Fetter.  The  player  spends  3  Pathos  and  rolls  Intelligence  + 
Lifeweb. With any successes, the target becomes a new one-dot 
Fetter for the Monitor.

During  the  same  scene,  the  Monitor  may  transfer  the 
temporary  Fetter  from  herself  to  another  wraith,  whom  she 
must touch. The player spends 1 additional Pathos and rolls 
Intelligence + Lifeweb (difficulty 7). If the subject wraith is 
unwilling, this becomes a resisted roll against his Willpower, 
and  the  Monitor’s  Shadow  gains  1  temporary  Angst.  If  the 
Monitor succeeds, the temporary Fetter transfers from her to 
the target wraith.

The effects of Splice Strand last for one day per initial success 
(use the worse of the two results if the Monitor transferred the 
temporary Fetter). After that, the wraith holding the temporary 
Fetter may pay 1 Pathos per day to maintain it. No wraith may 
have more than one temporary Fetter at a time through this art.
The Monitor may use Splice Strand to repair the effect of 
Sever Strand. All difficulties increase by 2, but success restores 
the Fetter at its full strength and permanence (and ongoing 
Pathos maintenance is unnecessary).
••• Web Parasite (Initiate)

A Monitor who fully understands another wraith’s reflec-
tions in mortal memories can attune herself to those connec-
tions, using their power as if they were her own. In doing so, she 
also assumes a portion of her victim’s psyche. It’s an unsettling 
metamorphosis, but one that’s necessary to deceive the Under-

world’s metaphysics. Oblivion, of course, is not so easily fooled, 
and the Monitor’s Shadow sometimes gains unpleasant insight 
into the victim — insight that the victim’s Shadow reciprocally 
shares when Web Parasite’s effects lapse.

System: The Monitor must understand (through Movement 
in the Web or basic investigation) another wraith’s connection 
to a Legacy or Memoriam Background and must be in a place 
with an actual or symbolic connection to the Background in 
question. The player spends 1 Willpower and rolls Perception 
+ Lifeweb (difficulty of the local Shroud rating). Each success 
transfers 1 dot of the Background from its rightful owner to the 
Monitor. The Monitor also gains the target wraith’s strongest 
Passion at 1 dot.

The Monitor’s Shadow gains 1 Angst per success. It also 
gains the strongest Dark Passion of the target wraith’s Shadow 
at 1 dot.

Web Parasite’s effects last for one week (save for the Angst, 
which functions normally). The player can extend it indefinitely 
at the cost of 1 Willpower per week, though each time she does 
this, the Monitor’s Shadow also gains 1 additional temporary 
Angst.  This  art  is  immediately  obvious,  though  the  victim 
doesn’t  automatically  know  who’s  leeching  his  connections 
to the Quick.
•••• Sever Strand (Common)

This  unwholesome  art  empowers  the  Monitor  to  rend 
wraiths from their Fetters. Unfortunate victims of Sever Strand 
suffer the usual effects of losing Fetters, plunging straight into 
Harrowings. Sever Strand closely resembles the dark arts by 
which some Spectres can rend Fetters, a fact which some critics 
have used to question the Monitors’ Guild’s relationship with 
the Labyrinth.

System: The Monitor must touch the target Fetter. The 
player spends 2 Pathos and 1 Willpower and makes a resisted 
Intelligence + Lifeweb roll against the Fetter owner’s Willpower. 
Each net success reduces the Fetter by 1 dot and grants the 
Monitor’s Shadow 1 temporary Angst.

If a Fetter is reduced in power but not completely severed, it 
recovers one lost dot per hour. A wraith whose Fetter is severed 
through this art (and who survives the subsequent Harrowing) 
may reattach the Fetter by touching it and spending a permanent 
Willpower dot. Alternately, he may use Splice Strand (or seek 
out a friendlier Monitor) to repair the damage.
•••• Walk the Web (Initiate)

Drawing  on  the  spiritual  tug  of  a  Fetter,  the  Monitor 
can travel to it with breathtaking speed. This allows not only 
convenient travel for ordinary business but a swift rescue of a 
threatened Fetter. However, a wise Monitor looks before leap-
ing — threatening a Fetter to lure a wraith into ambush is a 
time-honored tactic.

System:  The  player  spends  3  Pathos  and  2  Corpus  and 
rolls Perception + Lifeweb. Successes determine travel time, 
regardless of distance:

TRAITS

187

One hour.

1 success 
2 successes  15 minutes.
3 successes  One minute.
4 successes  15 seconds (5 turns).
5 successes  One turn.

While traveling via this art, the wraith is a hazy, intangible 
presence in the Underworld. To her perceptions, her surround-
ings are likewise a gray blur, save for a shining silver network 
of links between wraiths and Fetters. She may take no other 
actions while traveling, including using other Lifeweb arts.

The Monitor may bring along companions. All members of 
the group must hold hands. Each “passenger” who lacks Lifeweb 
increases the difficulty of all associated rolls by 1 (maximum 
10). In addition, the Monitor pays 1 extra Pathos per passenger, 
and each passenger must spend 1 Willpower or be left behind 
when the Monitor departs.
••••• Souls Interwoven (Common)

A Monitor who masters the interplay of energy between 
wraiths and their Fetters may establish her own new, permanent 
bonds. The wraith using this art takes on a willing mortal as a 
Fetter. In return, the mortal can communicate with the Moni-
tor at will. The mortal must enter into the bargain voluntarily, 
though the Monitor is certainly free to make promises she has no 
intention of keeping. That matter is between her and her Shadow.
System: The Monitor must touch the being she wishes to 
bond as a Fetter. The player spends 5 Pathos and 3 Willpower 
and  rolls  Intelligence  +  Lifeweb.  The  number  of  successes 
determines the new Fetter’s strength:
1-2 successes  Fetter •
3-5 successes  Fetter ••
6+ successes 

Fetter •••

As long as the wraith has the mortal as a Fetter, the mortal 
can spend 1 Willpower at any time to communicate with the 
Monitor  for  the  rest  of  that  scene,  regardless  of  location  or 
distance.  Each  party  must  speak  aloud  to  be  heard,  and  any 
supernatural power relying exclusively on speech may pass over 
this link (in either direction).

The  Monitor  can  use  this  art  on  a  living  (or  undead) 
supernatural being, but doing so requires an additional Pathos 
expenditure equal to the subject’s Willpower. The subject also 
must spend 5 points of whatever supernatural energy it uses in 
lieu of Pathos (e.g., Blood, Rage, Quintessence, and if all else 
fails, Willpower). Using Souls Interwoven on a vampire or other 
undead creature also gives the Monitor’s Shadow an amount of 
temporary Angst equal to half the deathless thing’s Willpower.
Use of Souls Interwoven is a blatant violation of the Dictum 
Mortuum, which is why sensible Monitors claim it’s impossible. 
••••• Master in the Web (Initiate)

For all its powers of manipulation, Lifeweb is an Arcanos 
of  seeing  and  knowing.  Elder  Monitors  who  study  Lifeweb’s 
signs and symbols in detail can transcend their perceptions to a 
state of near-omniscience. However, the constant, inescapable 
flood of information grinds away the Monitor’s Psyche — and 
invigorates her Shadow with visions of the damage it can do.
System: Once the Monitor learns Master in the Web, she 
may use Sense Strands, Vibrations in the Web, and Movement 
in the Web at will (even if she doesn’t already possess the art 
in question) and without paying Pathos. For any involved roll 
that isn’t a botch, the minimum outcome is 1 success for an art 
she doesn’t possess and 3 successes for an art she does possess.
When the wraith learns this art, she gains a permanent 
mentally debilitative condition related to her altered percep-
tions, and her Shadow gains 1 permanent Angst dot.

188

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Mnemoi

assion  may  create  a  wraith  but  memory 
defines  him.  His  identity  is  a  product  of 
his experiences — the sum total of every 
moment, bound up in a form that (at 
least  at  first)  draws  its  shape  from 
remembrances  of  the  mortal  shell. 
What  power,  then,  derives  from 
an Arcanos that shapes memory itself? What crimes 
might wraiths commit if they could erase the very 
knowledge of their acts?

In modern Stygia, Mnemosynis is the most 

feared of the outlawed Arcanoi. Its reputation 
is one of abuse and manipulation, of misdeeds 
hinging  on  the  erasure  or  alteration  of 
memories, of a grand conspiracy aimed at 
usurpation of the Imperial throne itself. 
Among the recently-reaped, it’s edgy 
to name-check Mnemosynis as the 
cause of any memory lapse or change 
in behavior. For older Legionnaires, 
this is an abhorrent mockery of a time 
when fear of Mnemoi control edged any 
discrepancy in recall or records. Every Ne-
cropolis has urban legends of wraiths who ran 
afoul of a Mnemos and were stripped of their 
very self-images and personalities — or whose 
closest friends utterly forgot them over the course 
of a single night.

Wraiths  who  dig  deeper  into  unsanctioned 

lore — or who ask the few Gaunts willing to share 
their recollections — find that Mnemosynis was once 
an accepted, even respected, Arcanos. Its practitioners 
preserved historical records, healed the wounds of loss and 
hardship,  and  uncovered  the  truth  of  crimes  for  Stygian 
courts.  But,  of  course,  that’s  how  the  Mnemoi  would  want 
everyone to remember them.

Guildmarks

Basic Mnemosynis lessons use mirror or crystal metaphors 
to help nascent Mnemoi visualize their work. The Arcanos’ 
guildmarks  reflect  this  in  the  wraith’s  Corpus,  though 
no two Mnemoi exhibit the exact same manifestation. 
One Mnemos has eyes with mirrored pupils, another’s 
fingernails  and  teeth  are  multifaceted  gemstones, 
the  face  of  a  third  shimmers  into  stained-glass 
perfection at one particular viewing angle, and 
a fourth’s voice carries undertones of shattering 
crystal. Mnemosynis guildmarks become more 
pronounced when the wraith activates his arts.
Before  its  destruction,  the  Mnemoi’s 
Guild  used  the  seal  of  a  balanced  scale 
weighing one eye, or one half of a bisected 
skull, in each pan. Today, Hierarchy of-
ficials find this symbol either revolting 
or alarming, depending on context.
The Guild
The  official  line  says  little  about 
the  Mnemoi’s  origins  or  former  role  in 
Stygia. They were wraiths with the power 
to read or alter memories, who once were a 
cornerstone  of  the  Stygian  legal  system  but 
succumbed to temptation and abused their arts 
for  self-enrichment.  Charon  discovered  their 
perfidy  and  ordered  their  destruction,  outlawing 
their Arcanos to ensure it would never again threaten 

Imperial stability.

Unofficial history provides somewhat more context. 
The Mnemoi predate Stygia, having originated as the first 
wraiths to make an organized attempt at recording events 
and phenomena in the Underworld. Initially, they relied on 
trained memory and oral history (few plasmics provide usable 
vellum, while attempts to produce paper from the trees lining 

TRAITS

189

the  River  of  Death’s  banks  ended  in  gruesome  disaster).  The 
rites and exercises of this training gave rise to the first sparks of 
Mnemosynis, and the Arcanos’ first use was the preservation of 
accurate, objective records.

As the proto-Mnemoi further explored their art, they de-
veloped methods for sharing their memories to ensure accurate 
knowledge transfers. By the time Charon founded Stygia, they 
were a respected order of teachers and loremasters. The discovery 
of methods for reading and altering other wraiths’ memories only 
gradually led to the capacity to reshape those same memories. 
Guild leaders quickly recognized the potential for abuse and 
clamped down on dissemination and use of such arts.

Two  officially  sanctioned  applications  of  those  arts  (re-
quested, some say, by Charon himself) expanded the Mnemoi’s 
role  in  Stygian  society.  The  first  saw  the  Mnemoi  working 
alongside the Pardoners to soothe or alter traumatic memories 
that provided fodder for Shadows’ abuses or led wraiths toward 
Oblivion. The second introduced Mnemos expert testimony 
(and, in some cases, direct transfer and display of memories) 
as a feature of trials for capital crimes.

Most sources agree this latter role, and the access it gave 
the Mnemoi to the halls of Stygian power, paved the way for the 
Guild’s eventual fall. Accounts vary on the specifics, perhaps 
because the Mnemoi so flagrantly abused their arts to cover 
their tracks, but whatever they did was enough for Charon to 
outlaw Mnemosynis and Mnemoi membership. The resulting 
military and secret police actions shattered the Guild, leaving 
only a handful of forlorn, low-ranking survivors. Even today, 
Imperial policy is to apprehend and soulforge any wraith caught 
using any Mnemosynis art. The Legions take great pains to avoid 
Harrowing such targets, as a Shadow-ridden Mnemos — or, 
even worse, an ex-Mnemos Spectre — is as horrifying as the 
rumor of renewed Mnemos organization.

Factions
By preserving and sharing memories of the Guild’s heyday, 
the remaining Mnemoi retain a surprising degree of cohesion. 
The  fugitive  guildmaster  Minos  and  his  right  hand  Phaedra 
remain in constant motion through the Hierarchy’s hinterlands, 
making brief personal contact with each newly recruited Mnemos 
to ensure proper instruction — and sufficient loyalty. Beneath 
them are the Ancients, a council of Mnemoi who predate the 
Guild’s fall, ensure its unbroken continuity, and recruit newly 
reaped wraiths or the occasional exceptional lemure.

Each Ancient inducts and trains new Mnemoi who are a 
good fit for his personal agendas. The Ancients themselves, 
and thus their students, self-divide by their goals for the Guild. 
Strigidae advocate a return to the guild’s origins as historians and 
cartographers, covertly preserving records in case of Underworld-
spanning  catastrophe.  Strigid  Ancients  seem  certain  such 
an event is imminent, though they refuse to share specifics. 
Alkionides prefer more engagement with wider wraith society, 
carefully providing solace and understanding as a combination of 
teachers and psychic healers. Some rogues among their number 

approach this as a business proposition, selling the memories of 
experiences as the ultimate addiction — or a powerful weapon. 
The few surviving Ancients who once worked with the Stygian 
judiciary now lead the Periphaeans. The Mnemoi’s militant arm, 
if they can be termed such a thing, they hunt the Underworld’s 
most reprehensible criminals and deliver them anonymously to 
the Legions, along with irrefutable evidence of their guilt. Their 
work runs the constant risk of exposure but they also maintain 
the Mnemoi’s last few ties to the Hierarchy.

Mnemosynis
Mnemosynis Systems

Unless otherwise specified, the difficulty of any Mnemosynis 
art that targets the Mnemos himself is always 6. Any art that 
targets another character requires touch and has a difficulty 
equal  to  the  target’s  Willpower.  Any  non-consensual  use  of 
Mnemosynis is a resisted roll against the target’s Willpower.

Any Mnemosynis art that can target another character can 
reach across the Shroud. In this case, the difficulty of the art is 
the target’s Willpower or the local Shroud rating, whichever’s 
higher. In a resisted roll, the target still uses her Willpower as 
her dice pool, even if the Shroud is higher.
• Keys to the Memory Palace (Common)

Mnemosynis’ foundational lessons give the wraith conscious 
control of his own memories. By visualizing a metaphoric struc-
ture, whether it’s a library or a relational database, the Mnemos 
organizes his mind. This enables him to recall even the most 
trivial details that evaded his conscious notice at the time he 
formed the memory.

System: When the Mnemos tries to recall the details of 
anything he previously experienced or witnessed, the player 
rolls Intelligence + Mnemosynis. Successes on this roll serve 
as equivalent successes on a Perception + Alertness (or other 
appropriate dice pool) roll, effectively giving the character a 
second chance to gather information as he relives the event. 
This art only provides information that was within the Mnemos’ 
perceptions  at  the  time,  though  this  may  include  any  other 
perception-altering arts he was using or subject to.

As a side benefit, this art also enhances the integrity of 
the wraith’s memories. Any attempt to use Mnemosynis (or an-
other memory-altering supernatural power) on him without his 
consent has its difficulty increased by his dots in Mnemosynis.
• Memory Vault (Initiate)

This complement to Keys to the Memory Palace impairs re-
call rather than augmenting it. Its basic technique suppresses one 
of the Mnemos’ memories, either temporarily or permanently. 
This is painless and establishes its own internal consistency, 
altering other memories that would otherwise point up the 
erased one’s absence. With this art, the wraith can numb the 
pain of an unpleasant experience, augment a deception with 

190

artificial ignorance, or render interroga-

tion fruitless for his captors.

System: When the Mnemos at-
tempts to erase his own memory, the 
player spends 1 Pathos and rolls 
Intelligence  +  Mnemosynis. 
With success, the offending 
memory is gone permanently.
At Mnemosynis ••, the 
wraith may set a trigger for 
restoring  the  memory:  a 
code phrase, a location, 
a  time,  another  char-
acter, a specific event. 
The memory remains 
suppressed  and  inac-
cessible until the Mne-
mos encounters the trigger, 
at which point the memory returns.
At  Mnemosynis  •••,  the 
wraith may cauterize the memory 
removal. The memory can never 
be  restored,  even  with  the  most 
powerful of Mnemosynis arts.

Memory Vault can’t remove 
memories of Passions or Fetters, 
nor can it remove any dots of At-
tributes, Abilities, Backgrounds, 
or Arcanoi. However, it can sup-
press the wraith’s awareness that 
he has those capabilities.
•• Further Reflection (Common)

Developed as a teaching tool, 
this  art  became  essential  to  the 
Mnemoi’s historical work and later 
ensured  the  Guild’s  continuity 
even as Stygia purged its leaders. 
With  Further  Reflection,  the 
Mnemos can project his memo-
ries (or another being’s memories 
that he’s made his own) to some-
one else’s mind. Depending on 
the memories being projected 
and the force with which the 
Mnemos  applies  them,  this 
can effect knowledge trans-
fer, or soothe or exacerbate 
existing emotional turmoil.
System: The player 
spends 2 Pathos and 
rolls  Charisma  + 

Mnemosynis. With success, the target experiences a sensory 
and emotional montage of the projected memories as she in-
ternalizes them. It’s readily apparent to her that they aren’t her 
own  memories  (unless  the  Mnemos  is  actually  playing  back 
the subject’s own memories that he previously captured with 
another art), but her mind integrates them to the same extent 
that it stores her own normal experiences.

If  the  Mnemos  uses  this  art  to  heal  painful  memories, 
the  subject’s  Shadow  loses  1  temporary  Angst  per  success. 
Conversely, if the Mnemos uses Further Reflection to inflict 
emotional trauma, the target’s Shadow and the Mnemos’ own 
Shadow each gain 1 temporary Angst per 2 successes, rounded up.
At Mnemosynis ••••, the Mnemos can use a single ap-
plication of this art to transfer knowledge — information only, 
and not a Trait — to a number of voluntary subjects up to his 
Willpower; at Mnemosynis •••••, this limit doubles. However, 
he still can’t heal or harm more than one subject at a time.
•• Washed in the Lethe (Initiate)

When a Mnemos’ very existence is illegal, it’s only wise 
to avoid notice. This art cloaks the wraith in anonymity, mak-
ing it difficult for witnesses to recall or record specifics of the 
Mnemos’ identity or actions. They can clearly remember events 
and the Mnemos’ actions but the Mnemos himself remains a 
nameless, faceless figure, impossible to describe or remember.
System: The player spends 2 Pathos and rolls Charisma + 
Mnemosynis. This isn’t an opposed roll, doesn’t require touch, 
and doesn’t take effect until the end of the scene. After the 
scene’s end, any observer who tries to connect the Mnemos’ 
appearance, name, or other distinguishing features to his ac-
tions during that scene must roll Willpower (difficulty of the 
Mnemos’ Appearance + Mnemosynis). If she beats the Mnemos’ 
successes, she has normal recall; otherwise, she cannot identify 
the Mnemos as having been present in the events of the scene 
in question.

Washed in the Lethe doesn’t remove any other memories 
of the Mnemos. If a witness already knew the character from 
previous acquaintance, she doesn’t forget him or any previous 
encounters. Nor does she forget that the Mnemos owns a relic 
Duesenberg.  For  that  matter,  she  retains  full  knowledge  of 
the fact that, in the last scene, someone burned down Legate 
Spinelli’s office (and Legate Spinelli) with barrow-flame and 
escaped in a relic Duesenberg. She just can’t remember that 
that particular Mnemos she knows was the arsonist in question, 
even though she clearly saw him do it.

The Mnemos can exempt a number of witnesses up to his 
dots in Intelligence from the effects of this art. In addition, any 
character who knows Keys to the Memory Palace is immune to 
Washed in the Lethe’s effects unless she consciously submits to 
it when the Mnemos invokes it.
••• Open Book (Common)

Open Book triggers a subject’s recall of a specific event, al-
lowing the Mnemos to experience and remember it for himself. 

TRAITS

191

To use this art, the Mnemos must know precisely what memory 
he wants to extract: “where you went last Thursday night” or 
“the last time you spoke to your friend Aristophanes.” Search-
ing for the subject’s memory of “the time you dumped Chretien 
into the Nihil” works only if the Mnemos knows for a fact that 
the subject did, in fact, pitch someone named Chretien down a 
hole in the fabric of reality. If the subject doesn’t actually possess 
the memory in question, Open Book provides only a headache.
System: The player rolls Intelligence + Mnemosynis and 
spends an amount of Pathos determined by the memory’s age. If 
the wraith has insufficient Pathos, the roll’s difficulty increases 
by 1 per point of shortfall.

With  success,  the  character  experiences  the  memory  in 
question as it plays out in real time. His senses in this experience 
are limited to the subject’s senses at the time the memory was 
made. While the memory plays out, the Mnemos is unaware 

of anything occurring around him except significant injuries 
(at least one Corpus level of damage). He may end the replay 
at any time.

Once the Mnemos has experienced the memory in full, 
he may subsequently recall it (through normal recollection or 
the use of other Mnemosynis arts) as if he were the original 
experiencer.
••• Tabula Rasa (Initiate)

The cornerstone of any Mnemos’ covert activities, Tabula 
Rasa extends Memory Vault’s lessons to other wraiths. This can 
be any specific recollection: memory of an act or a conversa-
tion, knowledge of a combat tactic, or the appearance or even 
existence of a suspected Mnemos.

System: The player spends 2 Pathos and rolls Charisma 
+ Mnemosynis; each success suppresses the target memory for 
one hour. If this is non-consensual, the Mnemos’ Shadow gains 
1 temporary Angst.

At Mnemosynis ••••, if the successes rolled equal or exceed 
the target’s Intelligence, the player may spend 1 Willpower to 
make the memory removal permanent. Involuntary use gives 
the Mnemos’ Shadow 2 more temporary Angst.

192

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

At Mnemosynis •••••, the Mnemos can remove a memory 
from a target’s Psyche while leaving it accessible to her Shadow, 
or  vice  versa.  This  gives  the  Mnemos’  Shadow  2  temporary 
Angst in addition to any other gains, even if this application 
of the art is consensual.

As with Memory Vault, Tabula Rasa can’t remove memo-
ries of Passions or Fetters, nor can it remove any dots of other 
Traits. If the Mnemos removes knowledge that could provoke 
an  existential  threat  (for  example,  making  a  vampire  forget 
her vulnerability to sunlight), the memory returns in full as 
soon as the victim sustains any injury or other trauma related 
to that injury.
•••• Phantom Pain (Common)

The  Mnemos  can  exploit  the  links  between  another 
wraith’s memories of her physical form and the reflections of 
those memories in her Corpus. This offensive (in more than 
one sense) art projects memories of injury into a target’s mind, 
opening psychosomatic wounds as the victim’s Corpus reacts 
to the assault.

System: The player spends 3 Pathos and rolls Charisma 
+ Mnemosynis, while the Mnemos’ Shadow gains 1 temporary 
Angst. The target suffers one level of damage per success. A 
target who fails to roll at least one success on her Willpower 
roll to resist also loses her next action as a sensory explosion of 
someone else’s disfigurement and agony detonates in her head.
When using this art, the Mnemos may call upon his Shadow 
for assistance. If the Shadow agrees to help, it gains 2 additional 
temporary Angst and the attack does aggravated damage.
•••• Soulkeeper (Initiate)

While lesser arts focus on specific memories, Soulkeeper 
enables the Mnemos to absorb whole periods of another being’s 
existence. These stored memories reside within the Mnemos’ 
own subconscious, where he can access them as if they were 
his own.

System: The wraith declares which memories he wants 
to store — up to a year’s worth per application of this art. The 
player spends 3 Pathos and 1 Willpower and rolls Intelligence 
+ Mnemosynis. With one success, the memories are hazy and 
dreamlike, bereft of specific details. Two successes provide the 
specifics of emotionally significant events, while three successes 
grant clarity equal to that of the Mnemos’ own experiences. 
With five or more successes, the memories are transferred in 
exacting detail with perfect recall.

A character can absorb a total length of outside memories 

up to one year per dot of Willpower.

Using  Soulkeeper  on  an  involuntary  subject  grants  the 

Mnemos’ Shadow 1 temporary Angst per success.
••••• Muse of Lies (Common)

The most feared Mnemosynis art allows the Mnemos to 
craft  and  implant  memories.  The  complexity  and  extent  of 

these falsehoods is limited only by the Mnemos’ imagination 
and attention to detail. Simple manipulations have covered up 
innumerable heinous acts, while complex constructs have sent 
kingdoms to war over decades of imagined offenses. Muse of Lies 
is the centerpiece of the Hierarchy’s anti-Mnemoi paranoia: a 
power that can make anyone remember anything.

System: This art incorporates two distinct techniques. The 
first is the creation of a false memory or set of memories. This 
requires the wraith to enter Slumber for one day per year (or 
fraction thereof) the false memories span. During this time, the 
wraith gains none of the normal benefits of Slumber; rather, he 
inhabits a dream state in which he laboriously builds the desired 
memories from a first-person perspective. At the end of this 
process, the player spends 2 Pathos and 2 Willpower and rolls 
Intelligence + Mnemosynis. The number of successes determine 
the accuracy and clarity of the constructed memories. One suc-
cess renders a dreamlike, abstract vision, three successes yield 
the desired broad strokes, and five successes create a perfect 
actualization of the Mnemos’ intent.

Once the wraith has crafted the false memory, he assimilates 
it into his consciousness, where it functions as any other natural 
memory (including the ability to apply other Mnemosynis arts 
to it). However, it is compartmentalized, and the wraith remains 
aware of its falsehood.

To  implant  the  crafted  memory  in  himself  or  another 
subject, the player spends 1 Pathos per success on the roll to 
craft  the  memory,  then  rolls  Charisma  +  Mnemosynis.  The 
Mnemos’  Shadow  gains  3  temporary  Angst.  Success  begins 
the process of implanting the memory. This takes one turn per 
year the memory spans (minimum 5 turns), during which both 
the Mnemos and his target are locked in a fugue state. Any 
damage either party suffers during this time breaks the trance 
and causes this application of the art to fail. If the time passes 
without interruption, the memory is implanted. 

The subject’s mind erases or rationalizes any conflicting 
memories, accepting the implanted memory as something she 
actually experienced. If there is a glaring error, or if an intimately 
trusted individual calls the memory into question, the subject 
may roll Willpower (difficulty 8). With success, she realizes her 
memories  have  been  altered,  though  she  isn’t  automatically 
aware of the source.
••••• Gray Man (Initiate)

This art underpins the legends of Mnemoi assaults on vic-
tims’ very identities. It’s the ultimate disappearing act, erasing a 
target from the collective memory of everyone who knew him.  
Written history, photographs, and similar records remain, but 
the Quick and the dead alike lose all personal recollection of 
him. Only this art’s scarcity keeps it from surmounting Muse 
of Lies in reputation.

As is only to be expected of a Mnemoi secret, Gray Man 
has more than one face. The art is equally efficacious when 
a  Mnemos  applies  it  to  himself.  It’s  the  ultimate  in  fugitive 
protection, providing near-perfect anonymity.

TRAITS

193

System: The Mnemos spends one month Slumbering within 
the target’s Fetter (which means he first must attune it as his 
own Fetter, too). As the Mnemos emerges from Slumber, the 
player spends all Pathos and one dot of permanent Willpower, 
then rolls Charisma + Mnemosynis (difficulty 9). The target 
resists with Willpower (difficulty of the Mnemos’ Charisma + 
Mnemosynis).

The Mnemos can’t use this art on a wraith without Fetters. 
Against a non-wraith target, he must first acquire that character 
as a Fetter, then Slumber within her for the requisite time.

If the Mnemos succeeds, all living memory of the target 
vanishes, save for the Mnemos and the victim herself. Anyone 
examining a record of her existence believes her to be legendary, 
apocryphal,  wholly  fictitious,  dead,  destroyed,  Transcended, 
or otherwise no longer among the Quick or the Restless. Any 
memories other beings form of her from this point forward are 
connected  to  whatever  new  identity  she  manages  to  scrape 
together. Observers who have seen her image may comment 
on her uncanny resemblance to her former identity but won’t 

connect the two unless she makes it painfully obvious. Even 
then, realization is slow and nigh-impossible to share (“Pshaw. 
Everyone knows she disappeared in the Tempest a long time 
ago.”).

Mechanically,  the  victim  loses  all  dots  in  Allies,  Con-
tacts,  Legacy,  Mentor,  Memoriam,  Notoriety,  and  Status.  In 
their place, she gains a pool of experience points equal to half 
the total experience-point value of the lost Backgrounds. She 
may spend this experience to purchase replacements for these 
Backgrounds as events during play provide the opportunity for 
the character to solidify her new identity or scrape together 
fragments of her old one. The Mnemos’ Shadow gains 5 points 
of temporary Angst, plus one additional point per dot of Back-
ground removed from the target.

If  the  Mnemos  uses  this  art  on  himself,  he  spends  one 
month slumbering within one of his own Fetters. The roll isn’t 
resisted and his Shadow gains no temporary Angst. All other 
effects are as described above.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Masquers

lasm, the stuff of which wraiths are made, 
often seems like flesh… but it isn’t. Among 
other things, it’s far more malleable, easier 
to mold and shape. The Restless call the 
power to do this Moliate, and those who 
practice it Masquers. (Older wraiths 
sometimes prefer the archaic term 

part of his form.
The Guild

of furniture, the chair he becomes will have a scratch or burn 
mark the same shape and length as the scar on the appropriate 

Soulshaping, while younger wraiths favor the names 
Fleshworking and Plasmatics.)

Using their arts, Masquers can turn wraiths 

into objects of great beauty, disfigure their en-
emies, or inflict horrific wounds in combat. And 
of course, Masquers can also change form to 
imitate other wraiths, making them unpar-
alleled actors — and spies. A Masquer’s 
most elaborate creations may take days 
or weeks to craft, but it takes very little 
time to turn one’s fingers into claws 
and rip another wraith’s throat out.

Guildmarks
Since a Masquer can change shape 

to remove or alter any physical feature, 
what  identifies  him  as  a  Masquer  is  that 
he has one prominent, distinguishing char-
acteristic he cannot change — it remains the 
same, mutatis mutandis, in every form or shape 
he  adopts.  The  most  common  such  feature  is 
the color of his eyes, but other examples include: 
a notable scar or tattoo, a snaggle tooth, an oddly 
shaped finger, or a nose that was broken and set badly 
so it’s got a distinctive “crook” to it.

For example, if a Masquer’s guildmark is a scar along 
the left side of his face, even if he uses Imitate to imperson-
ate another wraith’s face, the scar remains (thus potentially 
spoiling the disguise). If he uses Armory to protect himself 
with a “barrel helm,” the outside of the helm has a crease the 
same shape and length as the scar. If he Bodyshapes into a piece 

What would become the Guild of Masquers began 
ages ago as what amount to fashion houses and “art gal-
leries.” Wraiths learned early on that they could shape 
and stretch plasm. Fascinated by the possibilities, 
some of them studied this phenomenon in detail 

and developed Moliate.

Many early Masquers focused on making 
other  wraiths  (or  themselves)  more  attrac-
tive. Wealthy wraiths visited the Masquers’ 
“houses” daily or weekly, chasing the latest 
trends in the shape of the self. But more 
practical Masquers — and those they 
served  —  saw  beyond  the  cosmetic 
applications  of  their  art.  Espionage, 
assassination,  infiltration,  and  even 
open combat are child’s play for a wraith 
who can change the shape and capabili-
ties of his body at will. In time, the Masquers 
became as well known for these “services” 
as for their artistic pursuits, and many wraiths 

feared and avoided them.

When  the  Guilds  revolted,  the  Masquers 
followed  their  close  allies,  the  Usurers,  into  the 
rebel  camp  —  and  when  the  Usurers  abandoned 
the cause, the Masquers did the same. Deprived of the 
advantage of Masquer spies and killers, the rebels found 
their position weaker than ever and were soon forced to 
capitulate.  This  only  further  increased  the  distrust  and 

animosity most wraiths felt toward the Masquers.

In the often chaotic times since, with Charon gone and 
much  of  the  Underworld  facing  uncertainty  or  turmoil,  the 
Masquers are in greater demand than ever. Trust and respect, 
on the other hand, are almost impossible for the masters of 

TRAITS

195

Moliate to obtain. Anyone who’s anyone in the Underworld 
probably has at least one Masquer in his employ, if not 
several — but he keeps a close eye on them.

Factions
The Masquers’ Guild in some ways resembles a 
large partnership more than a true Guild, with Circles 
(many of them rather small) joining forces primarily 
to share information and resources. Most Circles form 
based on a common interest or practice, and 
these  “interests”  essentially  define  fac-
tions, such as: the Chorus of Faces, who 
use their skills to entertain and amaze; 
the Fleshwrights, practitioners of the 
ancient arts of molding wraiths’ plasm 
for aesthetic or practical purposes; the 
Secret Order, master spies, burglars, 
and assassins (often referred to by 
fearful  wraiths  as  “the  Spiders”); 
and  the  Janissaries,  feared  bands 
of  shape-shifting,  flesh-rending 
warriors.

Moliate
Moliate Systems

Failed  Moliate  rolls  often  result  in 
something  more  or  less  the  opposite  of 
what was desired: A wraith who wants to 
become more handsome loses points of Ap-
pearance; a Rend attack instead heals some 
Corpus points; new limbs have their own 
eerie intelligence and a hatred of their host 
body. Fixing these mistakes is troublesome 
and taxing at best, impossible at worst, and 
fuel  for  everyone  concerned’s  Shadows  in 
the meantime.
• Imitate (Common)

The first art a Masquer learns is how to 
change  her  face  to  impersonate  another 
wraith. She may only alter the shape of 
her face, not any other part of her body, 
and has an easier time doing this if she 
can see the visage she wants to mimic.

System: The wraith pays 1 Pathos 
to use Imitate. The player rolls Dexterity 
+ Moliate. The difficulty is 4 if the Mas-
quer has a skinmask of the subject (see 
Rend, below), 8 if she has to work from 
memory, and something in between 
if she can see the subject or has a 
visual source on which to rely.

The number of successes on the roll indicate how good a 
job the Masquer did; another wraith has to achieve more 
successes on a Perception + Awareness roll to realize it’s 
a disguise. The change lasts until the Masquer chooses 
to change back or is somehow forced to.
• Shapesense (Initiate)

Masquers know the work of their colleagues. As a 
result, they can usually tell when another wraith’s been 

Moliated, and how.

System:  The  player  rolls  Perception  + 
Moliate  against  a  difficulty  equal  to  the 
number of successes achieved on the Dex-
terity + Moliate roll to alter the subject. 
The more successes achieved, the more 
the  Masquer  learns.  The  information 
gathered  could  include  what  art  was 
used to Moliate the subject, who did 
the work (or what faction he belongs 
to), and perhaps even what the subject 
originally looked like.
•• Sculpt (Common)

Sculpt lets a Masquer alter his own Corpus 
— or another wraith’s. This ranges from simple 
adornments (adding colors, glows, or tattoos), to 
enhancing or changing a wraith’s appearance, 
to  major  changes  like  creating  fangs  or  more 
limbs. He cannot, however, create additional 
or alternate sensory organs. To do that requires 
Panoply of Eyes (see below).

System: The Masquer pays 1 Pathos to use 
Sculpt.  The  subject  being  altered  (whether  it’s 
himself  or  another  wraith)  loses  1  Corpus  level 
in the process, but Sculpt otherwise cannot cause 
injury to the subject.

The player rolls Dexterity + Moliate (difficulty 
7).  The  number  of  successes  required  is  up  to  the 
Storyteller, but typically depends on the extent of the 
changes to the subject’s form: Mere cosmetic changes 
(like adding a tattoo or changing skin color) require 2 
successes, minor changes require 3-4 successes, major 
changes (like adding or removing limbs and organs) 
require  5-6  successes,  and  altering  the  entire  body 
requires 8 or more successes. All changes made are 
permanent (though another use of Sculpt can change 
them, of course). 

Generally  speaking,  Sculpt  can’t  alter  a  wraith’s 
physical capabilities (or his deathmark). It cannot, for 
example, add dots of Strength, increase his running speed, 
or let him make extra attacks in a turn. Exceptions 
to that general rule include the following scenarios:
A  wraith  Moliated  to  have  fangs  can  perform 
the Bite maneuver (p. 332), while one Moliated to 

196

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

have claws or talons can perform the Claw maneuver (p. 332). 
Other than this, a Masquer needs Armory (see below) to shape 
his body into weapons.

A Masquer can add or subtract dots of his subject’s Ap-
pearance equal to the highest number of dots the Masquer has 
in any Moliate art.

A  wraith  cannot  use  additional  limbs  to  attack  more 
frequently, defend himself, move more swiftly, or the like. But 
the limbs are otherwise as functional as their form permits and 
may allow the wraith to do things someone with their original 
number of limbs cannot (for example, use two hands to play the 
drums while holding up a relic trash can lid to protect himself 
from thrown relic bottles in his third hand). What can and 
can’t be done, and whether any rolls are required to succeed, 
is up to the Storyteller.

Additionally, a Masquer can use Sculpt to “repair” (and 
thus heal) aggravated damage. Each success achieved on the 
Manipulation + Moliate roll made for this purpose heals 1 Corpus 
level, but this costs the Masquer 1 Willpower, 1 Pathos, and an 
additional 1 Pathos per Corpus level healed.
•• Unmarked (Initiate)

While Sculpt cannot change or remove a wraith’s death-

mark, this old, largely forgotten art can.

System:  The  wraith  pays  1  Pathos  and  the  player  rolls 
Dexterity  +  Moliate  (difficulty  8).  One  success  allows  the 
Masquer to alter the nature of a deathmark (for example, from 
a scar to a tattoo), but not the mark’s form or content. Two or 
more successes also let him change its form/content or remove 
it entirely. In either case, the change only lasts for a maximum 
duration of one day per success on the roll.
••• Armory (Common)

Many Masquers make terrifying warriors, hunters, and as-
sassins because of this art, with which they mold their bodies 
into armor and melee weapons. These “items” ordinarily have 
a gray, mirrorlike sheen, but many Masquers shape and color 
their Armory creations in ornate ways to personalize them.

System: Using Armory costs a wraith 3 Pathos. He can only 
use it on himself. He cannot create both armor and weapons at 
the same time with Armory. As a result, creating both requires 
two distinct uses of the art.

To form a melee weapon out of part of a Masquer’s body 
(typically a hand/arm), the player rolls Intelligence + Moliate 
(difficulty of wraith’s Stamina +3). Each success achieved allows 
the wraith to roll one additional die in hand-to-hand combat. A 
Masquer can create whatever type of melee weapon he prefers 
(swords and daggers are the most popular), and automatically 
knows how to use it without penalty. On the other hand, shap-
ing part of one’s body into a weapon prevents that body part 
from serving its normal function. For example, a hand turned 
into a dagger can no longer grasp things. After all, it’s now a 
blade, not a hand.

To sculpt the Masquer’s body into armor, the player rolls 
Stamina  +  Moliate  (difficulty  of  the  wraith’s  Strength  +3). 
Each  success  adds  one  die  to  the  wraith’s  soak  roll.  On  the 
downside, each success after the first adds +1 to the difficulty 
of any Dexterity-based roll because of the armor’s stiffness.

Using Armory requires one minute or more, depending on 
the extent and ornateness of the changes. For an additional 1 
Pathos a Masquer can mold his body in just one turn.

The changes wrought by Armory are obvious to anyone 
who sees the Masquer. A Masquer can disguise Armory armor, 
making it look like his ordinary skin or clothing, but this costs 
an additional 1 Pathos and increases the difficulty of the roll 
by 1. Weapons can’t be disguised this way.

All changes a Masquer makes to his body with Armory 
are permanent until he chooses to change them back (at no 
cost in Pathos) or someone else uses Moliate to force him into 
another shape.
••• Panoply of Eyes (Initiate)

Masquers of advanced skill can create additional sensory 
organs — or even give themselves senses they don’t ordinarily 
possess.

System: The wraith spends 2 Pathos to use Panoply of Eyes. 
The player rolls Stamina + Moliate. If the Masquer wants to 
create extra organs for senses he normally possesses, the difficulty 
is 7; if he wants to create organs for new senses, it’s 9. In either 
case, the change lasts for one hour per success.

The most common use of this art is to create more eyes 
(often literal “eyes in the back of his head”), or additional 
sensory organs of some other sort. This makes it difficult to 
surprise or sneak up on the Masquer (increase the number of 
successes needed on any Stealth-based or similar roll by the 
number of successes achieved with Panoply of Eyes). It also 
enhances  his  perceptiveness  (each  success  with  Panoply  of 
Eyes grants 1 extra die on any roll involving Perception or 
Alertness). But extra sensory organs (of any type) create the 
risk of sensory overload. Every turn the Masquer uses them 
in  situations  of  high  sensory  input  (most  combats,  artistic 
performances, and the like), he has to roll Stamina + Alter-
ness (difficulty 7). Failure means he wastes the turn trying to 
comprehend the sensory input.

A Masquer can also give himself new physical senses, such 
as seeing in the infrared or ultraviolet spectra, hearing ultrasonic 
or infrasonic sound, or having echolocation like a bat or sonar 
like a dolphin. The Storyteller determines the exact effects, but 
this typically provides the same bonus to Perception/Alertness 
as extra sense organs do in appropriate situations. Unfortunately, 
the same risk of sensory overload exists.
•••• Rend (Common)

A Masquer who knows this fearsome art can inflict grievous 
wounds on other wraiths just by touching them, often leaving 
them mutilated and disfigured. With Rend, a Masquer can liter-

ally rip another wraith’s face off. These horrific trophies, known 
as skinmasks, help the wraith Imitate the victim (see above).
System:  The  wraith  spends  1  Pathos  to  use  Rend,  and 
also gains 1 temporary Angst. She must touch her target (this 
may require a Dexterity + Brawl attack roll). The player rolls 
Dexterity + Moliate (difficulty of the target’s Stamina +3). Each 
success inflicts one die of aggravated damage, plus an additional 
die for each additional 1 Pathos the Masquer chooses to spend. 
If the wraith achieves five or more successes, she may tear off 
part of her opponent’s Corpus (an appendage or limb, his face, 
or just a chunk of plasm).
•••• Girding (Initiate)

Masquers who have mastered the art of Armory can use it 
on other wraiths, thus “outfitting” them for combat, Helldives, or 
other perilous duties. Given enough time and enough resources, 
Masquers with this knowledge can kit out entire armies.

System: Only Masquers who already know Armory can 
learn Girding. It works just like Armory, but the Masquer can 
use it on other wraiths.
••••• Bodyshape (Common)

The height of the Masquer’s art, Bodyshaping allows him 
to transform his (or another wraith’s) Corpus into practically 
anything imaginable: an animal, a piece of furniture, a different 
person, or a piece of art.

System: The wraith spends 4 Pathos to use Bodyshaping 
(and if the victim’s unwilling, he gains 2 temporary Angst). The 
player rolls Dexterity + Moliate against a difficulty that depends 
on the complexity of the form being changed into. Something 
simple (like a large puddle of water, a wall, or a drab-looking 
chair)  is  difficulty  5.  At  the  other  extreme,  the  form  of  an 
Anacreon wearing his full regalia is difficulty 9.

It takes one turn per point of difficulty to use Bodyshaping. 
Each success beyond the first on the Wits + Moliate roll reduces 
this by one turn (to a minimum of one turn).

A Bodyshaped wraith retains his standard Attributes, Abili-
ties, senses, Arcanoi, and so forth while transformed (unless 
this defies common or dramatic sense). He gains any additional 
physical capabilities the shape has (such as being able to fly, if 
he has wings), but not the supernatural ones.

A wraith subjected to Bodyshape cannot lose or gain more 
than 10% of his body mass or size. Not even the most power-
ful Masquer can transform a human-sized wraith into a tiny 
mouse, or Gorool.

Bodyshaping lasts for one scene per success achieved, after 
which the subject returns to his normal form. If the Masquer 
wants to make the change permanent, it requires the invest-
ment of one point of permanent Willpower. 
••••• Savage (Initiate)

While Rend frightens most wraiths, this art, a secret jeal-
ously guarded by the Guild for centuries, utterly terrifies them, 
because it lets a Masquer rip away enough of a wraith’s Corpus 
to damage him permanently

System: The wraith spends 3 Pathos to use Savage, and 
also gains 1 temporary Angst per success achieved. He must 
touch his target (this may require a Dexterity + Brawl attack 
roll). The player rolls Dexterity + Moliate (difficulty equal 
to the target’s Stamina or Willpower, whichever’s higher, + 
3, to a maximum of 10). For every two successes achieved, 
the Masquer permanently reduces one of his target’s Physical 
Attributes by 1.

The only known way to restore Attribute points lost to 
Savage  is  painstaking  “surgery”  with  Sculpt.  This  requires  a 
number of successes equal to the number achieved to inflict 
the injury against difficulty 10 and takes days of effort. This 
can only be tried once per lost Attribute point. If that attempt 
fails, the damage can never be corrected.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Spooks

raiths are creatures of their Passions — even, 
perhaps especially, the darker ones. Outrage 
may  be  the  Arcanos  that  expresses  a 
wraith’s will as kinetic energy, but every 
Spook knows that anger is the key to 
mastering  it.  Indeed,  some  wraiths 
spontaneously  manifest  Outrage’s 

Artifacts  and  Pathos  bottled  from  large  emotional  events. 
Cross-Shroud damage and leverage were Spook specialties, too. 
Careful cultivation of mutually beneficial relationships 
with corrupt officials avoided Stygian sanctions against the 
Guild as a whole,but many individual Spooks clashed with 

Imperial law, to both sides’ detriment. 

basic arts in times of stress, particularly when the object 
of their wrath lies across the Shroud and seemingly 
out of their reach. This makes Outrage’s lesser arts 
relatively common, though dabblers rarely attain 
great proficiency in the Arcanos.

Wraiths who dismiss Outrage as a mere 
thug’s weapon do the Arcanos and Spooks 
alike a disservice. Anger is the gateway to 
Outrage, but the Spook who masters his 
darker emotions can unlock higher arts 
which  are  tools  of  surprising  preci-
sion and subtlety. Still, even refined 
applications of Outrage can feed the 
Shadow if used for wanton destruction, 
so wise Spooks learn to throw their weight 
around sparingly. 
Guildmarks
Outrage’s raw physicality transposes itself 

onto the Corpus of its students. Novice Spooks 
display  uneven,  anatomically  unlikely  muscle 
development. More experienced Outrage users take 
on hulking, ‘roided-out physiques.
The Guild

Long before the Breaking, the Spooks’ Guild built its 

reputation on unwholesome work. Spooks hired themselves 
out as muscle and worse, dirtying their Corpus with jobs the 
other Guilds couldn’t or wouldn’t touch. Their resemblance 
to mortal organized crime didn’t stop there, as Spooks had their 
fingers in every Necropolis’ black markets, trading dangerous 

Vice, agitation, and demolition kept the Guild’s 
casual associates busy, but Spooks who yearned for 
something greater found purpose in their organiza-
tion’s  roots  as  a  breakaway  Haunter  sect.  Early 
Haunters shared frustration with the Shroud, but 
pursued a wide array of methods to overcome it. 
To some, the Shroud was primarily an obstacle 
to protecting the things that anchored them 
against  Oblivion’s  pull:  Fetters,  Haunts, 
Memoriam,  and  ties  to  the  Skinlands. 
This rejection of the Haunters’ greater 
goals led to a passionate but ultimately 
non-destructive split. 

As  part  of  this  schism,  early 
Spooks  turned  away  from  Pandemo-
nium and its unpredictable evocations. 
They found a more reliable tool in Outrage, 
then a commonplace but unrefined art, and 
set to studying its potential — and its ties to 
Oblivion. Already pragmatists with a penchant 
for direct action, the Spooks saw Oblivion itself 
as a greater challenge and a more immediate threat 

than the Shroud.

Experts  in  protecting  their  own  connections 
to  the  Skinlands,  the  Spooks  became  Stygia’s  go-to 
Guild when other Restless needed immediate interven-
tion to defend a loved one or rescue a former possession. 
This aspect of the greater battle against Oblivion became 
the Spooks’ ostensible purpose and the public face of their 

identity as a Guild.

The Spooks’ goals were noble. Their methods, however, 
brought them into immediate conflict with the Dictum Mor-

TRAITS

199

tuum. Two factors kept the Legions from their throats: their 
willingness to join any fight against a creature of Oblivion and 
the number of Stygian functionaries who secretly benefitted 
from their work. For many, the price of saving a Fetter was a 
promise to look the other way in the future. Calling in these 
debts during the Breaking spared the Spooks the worst of the 
Hierarchy’s  attention.  Today,  business  continues  much  as  it 
has for centuries.
Factions
Centuries of recruiting among practical-minded wraiths 
who are “good with their hands” has made Spook organization 
a cross between a labor union and a crime family. At the top is 
the Commission of Five, an elected body that sets policy and 
regulates conflict within the guild. Commissioners come from 
the  99  Bosses,  who  oversee  regional  activities.  Local  action 
within a Necropolis is the responsibility of a Controller, who 
manages the fractious business of his “made men” Armadars. 
Most Armadars run a circle of Defenders, with whom they share 
a philosophy and business model. 

Lifeliners work to protect other wraiths’ Fetters and are 
the loudest voices for the Spooks’ original purpose. Defending 
death-related remembrance as a whole is the Mementomorians’ 
agenda, and they support their efforts through trade in rare 
distillations  of  Pathos.  Ties  to  the  Haunters  are  strongest 
among  the  Shroudbreakers,  who  also  combat  mortal  ghost 
hunters. The Spooks closest to street-level Stygian crime fill 
out the Gray Gangs and rarely get involved with more sensi-
tive Guild activities. 

Outrage
Outrage Systems

Any  use  of  Outrage  across  the  Shroud  uses  the  local 
Shroud  rating  as  its  difficulty.  Using  Outrage  on  a  target  in 
the Underworld has a difficulty of 7 in the Shadowlands, 6 in 
the Tempest, and 5 in the Labyrinth. However, in the Laby-
rinth, each invocation of Outrage feeds the wraith’s Shadow 
1 temporary Angst.
• Wraithgrasp (Common)

The  wraith  can  push  or  lift  inanimate  objects  in  the 
Skinlands. Only simple, straight-line motion is possible with 
Wraithgrasp,  but  sometimes  that’s  all  that’s  needed  to  get  a 
mortal’s  attention  or  affect  the  course  of  events  among  the 
Quick. This art is too slow for a direct attack, but it certainly 
can  be  used  indirectly.  Flowerpots  mysteriously  falling  from 
high windows, runaway hot dog carts pushing pedestrians into 
traffic: freak accidents or Wraithgrasp?

System:  The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Strength 
+ Outrage. With a single success, the wraith can exert a few 
pounds of force, just enough to press a button or start a pencil 
rolling.  Each  additional  success  grants  one  dot  of  effective 
Strength for lifting (see “Feats of Strength,” p. 320). Thus, with 

5 successes, the Spook can lift or shove a Skinlands object as if 
he had Strength ••••. The shoved object can move no faster 
than half the wraith’s normal walking speed.
• Taptap (Initiate)

Unexpectedly subtle for a basic Outrage art, Taptap was 
once a Spooks’ Guild trade secret. Centuries of leaks have spread 
it beyond the organization’s control, but it’s still uncommon, as 
the Arcanos’ students tend to seek out flashier manifestations. 
Wiggling a finger, the Spook audibly taps on an object or silently 
presses someone else’s skin within line of sight. This can be a 
distraction, but it’s more useful as a signal — particularly if the 
wraith and his audience know a tap code (of which the Guild 
has several). More recently, younger Spooks have discovered 
that this art is an excellent way to affect touchscreen computer 
interfaces.

System:  The  player  spends  1  Pathos  and  rolls  Stamina 
+ Outrage. For three turns per success, the Spook can tap or 
knock lightly on a surface, or can silently tap or poke a single 
other being. In either case, this art works within line of sight. 
It isn’t strong enough to move anything with more substance 
than a dust mote.

Communicating via Taptap is slow, as the wraith must spell 
out individual symbols: one word per turn in most cases. The 
Storyteller is the final authority on the complexity of messages 
that Taptap can convey.

If the player also spends 1 Corpus when activating Taptap, 
the Spook can manipulate touchscreens and other technolo-
gies that respond to physical input through similar principles. 
•• Stonehand Punch (Common)

A simple, brutal telekinetic strike, Stonehand Punch allows 
the Spook to pummel a single victim across the Shroud or in 
the Underworld. He must touch a Skinlands target, effectively 
using Stonehand Punch to convey his normal strength across the 
Shroud, but he can strike Underworld targets outside his reach.
System: The player spends 1 Pathos and makes a normal 
Brawl attack. If it hits, he may spend 1 additional Pathos to add 
the wraith’s dots in Outrage to the damage dice pool. Against 
an Underworld target, this attack has a maximum range equal 
to the wraith’s Willpower in yards. Stonehand Punch may target 
both characters and inanimate objects. 
•• Stonehand Parry (Initiate)

Spooks get in a lot of fights. After a few Harrowings, smart 
Spooks look for ways to avoid being hit. This age-old Outrage 
art is the brawler’s best friend, allowing a bare-handed Spook 
to block clubs, swords, or Moliated tentacles.

System: As the wraith is about to be hit by a close-combat 
attack, the player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Strength + Out-
rage. Successes on this roll cancel successes on the attack on 
a one-for-one basis. Extra successes become levels of bashing 
damage on the attacker or weapon that struck the Spook. Us-
ing Stonehand Parry is reflexive and doesn’t cost an action.

200

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The wraith may block thrown or archaic ranged weapon attacks at +1 difficulty. Firearm attacks and 

similar faster-than-sight projectiles are impossible to stop with Stonehand Parry.

••• Wings of Rage (Common)

Sometimes a Spook needs to get there right now. Wings of Rage starts as speed and strength 

born of desperation, allowing the wraith to undertake implausible feats of athleticism.

System: The player spends 2 Pathos. For the rest of the scene, he may add the wraith’s 
dots in Outrage to his Athletics dice pools. Additionally, when calculating the Spook’s 

running speed, his dots in Outrage add to his Dexterity.

••• Tantrum (Initiate)

A Spook using Tantrum stands at the eye of a telekinetic storm, hurling loose 
objects about with abandon. This art is exhausting to use, but it’s an excellent 
means of impairing multiple aggressors or persuading groups of meddlesome 
kids to vacate. Tantrum simultaneously affects both the Skinlands and the 
Shadowlands, which makes it something of a double-edged mace.

System: The player spends 2 Pathos and 2 Corpus and rolls Stamina 
+ Outrage. The Spook’s Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst. In a radius 
equal to the Spook’s Willpower in yards, random energies pick up 
every loose small object (less than one pound) and fling it about in 
a swirling vortex that lasts for one turn per success rolled.

The randomly moving cloud of debris makes combat difficult. 
Any hand-to-hand or firearm attack targeting a character in the 
Tantrum suffers +1 difficulty, and any thrown or archaic missile 
weapon attack suffers +2 difficulty. At the Storyteller’s discretion, 
other rolls may suffer similar impairment from the distraction and 
interference. In addition, each character in the Tantrum at the 
beginning of each turn suffers 2 levels of bashing damage from 
constant battering.

The Spook himself is immune to Tantrum’s negative effects, as 
he has enough control over the storm to keep it from blocking his 
own shots. The radius of effect remains centered on him as he moves.
At  Outrage  ••••,  the  player  may  spend  2  additional  Corpus 
when invoking Tantrum to double the radius of effect or contract it 
to one yard. At Outrage •••••, he may alternately or addition-
ally spend 1 additional Pathos to attach Tantrum to another 
target, centering its effects on an object or character rather 

than himself.
•••• Death’s Touch (Common)

At this level of mastery, Outrage begins to require a 
steady hand more than a volatile heart. Death’s Touch 
grants the Spook his full capacity for fine manipulation 
over objects in the physical world. In the Underworld, 
Death’s Touch is a similarly refined Stonehand Punch, 
allowing finesse at range.

System:  To  use  this  art  across  the  Shroud,  the 
player spends 3 Pathos and rolls Stamina + Outrage. 
For one minute per success rolled, the wraith may 
handle physical objects with his full Strength and 
Dexterity. This includes wielding weapons or brawl-
ing, though each cross-Shroud attack grants the Spook’s 

Shadow 1 temporary Angst.

TRAITS

201

In the Underworld, the player spends 3 Pathos and rolls 
Stamina + Outrage. For one turn per success rolled, the wraith 
may telekinetically project his hands at a maximum range equal 
to  his  Willpower  in  yards,  manipulating  objects  or  brawling 
at will. As above, each attack with Death’s Touch gives the 
Shadow 1 temporary Angst. 

If the wraith becomes intangible while Death’s Touch is 

active, the effect ends immediately.
•••• Wyldfire (Initiate)

Some Spooks’ rage burns hot, while others stoke a cold 
fury.  Wyldfire  literalizes  the  metaphor,  enabling  the  wraith 
to conjure barrow-flame. This art’s raw destructive potential 
delights the Shadow, all the more so because the wraith has 
no control over the fire once he releases it. 

System: The wraith concentrates for a full turn, focusing 
on a target within his Willpower x 10 yards. The player spends 2 
Pathos and 1 Corpus and rolls Stamina + Outrage. The wraith’s 
Shadow  gains  1  temporary  Angst  per  success.  The  size  and 
intensity of the barrow-flame produced depend on successes:
1 success 

Candle (soak difficulty 3, 1 level of aggravated 
damage/turn)

2 successes  Torch  (soak  difficulty  4,  1  level  of  aggravated 

damage/turn)

damage/turn)

3 successes  Campfire (soak difficulty 5, 2 levels of aggravated 

4 successes  Bonfire (soak difficulty 7, 2 levels of aggravated 

5 successes 

damage/turn)
Inferno (soak difficulty 9, 3 levels of aggravated 
damage/turn)

As always, the barrow-flame does aggravated damage, and 

victims may soak it only if they have an appropriate art.

If  Wyldfire  creates  barrow-flame  in  the  Skinlands,  the 

resulting conflagration triggers the Fog.
••••• Obliviate (Common)

Distilling his anger into raw destructive energy, the wraith 
unleashes it in a crushing, burning spasm of entropy. Oblivi-
ate is the Spook’s nuclear option, unleashed when there’s no 
choice but feed Oblivion and his own Shadow alike. Like most 
Outrage arts, Obliviate can affect targets in the Skinlands or 
the Underworld alike.

System: The wraith must touch his intended target. The 
player spends 3 Pathos and rolls Strength + Outrage. The Spook’s 

Shadow gains 3 temporary Angst. Each success inflicts one level 
of aggravated damage that bypasses armor and is soakable only 
if the victim has an appropriate art.

A living being killed by Obliviate becomes a wraith but 
immediately falls into a Destruction Harrowing. A wraith re-
duced to zero Corpus through this damage likewise suffers an 
immediate Destruction Harrowing. In either case, failure at the 
Harrowing doesn’t consign the character to Oblivion. Instead, 
she becomes a Spectre.

A destroyed Spectre or plasmic returns to Oblivion. The 

Labyrinth knows its own.

A destroyed inanimate object falls directly into Oblivion 
(unless it’s Inhabited, in which case it becomes a relic — and 
the luckless Artificer suffers the same damage that the item 
itself took).
••••• Anger Enough for Two Worlds (Initiate)

Most  Outrage  arts  reach  across  the  Shroud.  This  one 
reaches for the Shroud, takes it by the throat, and beats it into 
submission. Never willingly taught outside the Spooks’ Guild, 
Anger Enough for Two Worlds rends the barrier between the 
Skinlands and the Shadowlands to shreds. It exacts a terrible 
toll on the wraith who uses it, but in extremis dedicated Spooks 
are willing to pay its price.

System: Anger Enough for Two Worlds is usable only in 
the Shadowlands. The player spends 1 Willpower and 3 Pathos 
and rolls Strength + Outrage. The wraith loses 1 Corpus per 
success, his Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst per success, and 
every other character in the scene suffers 1 level of bashing 
damage  per  success.  The  local  Shroud  ratings  drops  by  the 
number of successes rolled. It regains one point every turn until 
it’s back to its normal value. 

If this art reduces the Shroud below 4, the Shadowlands 
and Skinlands become one until the Shroud recovers. During 
this time, the Shroud is considered to be 3 for purposes of all 
rolls relying on it. All wraiths in the area can interact with 
Skinlands objects as if they had mortal bodies, while all relics 
become fully visible and tangible to Skinlands denizens. Any 
supernatural power that normally works on only one side of 
the Shroud can affect anything in the area. Such a condition 
invokes the Fog, gets Oblivion’s full attention, and is immedi-
ately obvious to every supernatural being in the vicinity. The 
Storyteller  determines  what  these  latter  effects  do  but  they 
should have far-reaching repercussions.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Haunters

The Guild

andemonium  is  the  Arcanos  of  invoking 
marginally controlled chaos on the far side 
of the Shroud. It has spawned a thousand 
tales of Fortean occurrences, and repeated 
exposure has driven many victims into 
gibbering helplessness. Disturbingly, it 
also seems to have similar effects on 

its own users. To outsiders, Pandemonium can seem as 
much an outward manifestation of chaos as an Arcanos.
Haunters have a more nuanced perspective. 

True, Pandemonium attracts more than its share 
of broken wraiths, but a lot of them were a little 
different  before  they  began  meddling  with 
weirdness. Like any psychoactive substance, 
this Arcanos works best for users who al-
ready know what they want out of it. It’s 
a tool of disruption. On the individual 
level, it messes with events or people’s 
perceptions.  On  the  macro  scale,  it 
wreaks havoc with the Shroud — or 
so the Haunters hope. No one learns 
Pandemonium out of a desire for subtlety.

Guildmarks
Even  by  the  Underworld’s  standards, 
Haunters  are  quirky,  exhibiting  peculiar 
mannerisms that seem calculated to unnerve 
witnesses. Reflexive meddling and antiauthori-
tarianism,  spatial  and  temporal  anomalies,  and 
eldritch hallucinations (or are they true visions?) 
nibble at the edges of the wraith’s sanity. Other Ar-
canoi may sign a wraith’s Corpus, but Pandemonium 
leaves its mark on the psyche. Many Haunters do affect 
cloaks,  greatcoats,  or  other  flowing  garments  that  can 
billow dramatically on cue, but this is a fashion statement, 
not a true guildmark. What marks a true Haunter is the thing 
seen out of the corner of the eye, the disturbing hint of what’s 
bubbling under the surface of the Haunter’s self-control.

To the Hierarchy’s rank and file (and most other unaffili-
ated wraiths), the Haunters are bereft of the organization or 
defined function of a true Guild, looking more like a social 
club of misfits and vandals who practice arts custom-tailored 
to  upend  the  Dictum  Mortuum.  Their  only  possible 
value is in scaring mortals away from places that need 
to remain unmolested, but their unreliability makes 
them untrustworthy. Hierarchs who’ve been around 
a while take the Haunters more seriously — as a 
threat. Neologisms like “security concern” and 
“anti-Shroud insurgents” feature prominently 
in Legion analyses. Taken as a body of data, 
Haunter activities resemble a multiheaded 
rebellion  against  Charon’s  laws.  They’re 
not blowing up citadels or hijacking ghost 
planes but they do lead a lot of mortals 
to ask the wrong questions about what 
exactly does happen after you die. And 
in its own way, that’s just as dangerous.
The  Hierarchy  recognizes  some 
of  the  symptoms  but  fails  to  understand 
the disease. Haunters have been around in 
one form or another since the nights when 
humanity’s evolving religious beliefs first spun 
a barrier between the living and the dead. Long 
before the concept of Guilds arrived in the Shad-
owlands, these wraiths were slamming themselves 
against the Shroud in vain attempts to sunder it and 
return the binary states of life and death to their rightful 
places on a continuum of being. Charon’s decrees were 
repugnant, if not blasphemous, to these proto-Haunters. 
They, in turn, took it upon themselves to reopen mortals’ 
minds to the possibilities whose denial gave rise to the Shroud.
As the other Guilds evolved, Haunters mimicked their 
trappings for protective coloration. Their ostensible purpose — 
hauntings for hire, have ectoplasm, will travel — became the 

TRAITS

203

reality for most outsiders and even their junior members. Any 
Guild alliances were tenuous, and the War of the Guilds puri-
fied the Haunters by soulforging the overly political members. 
Today,  the  business  of  Haunting  continues  apace.  The 
Guild  willingly  takes  payment  for  its  services  because  each 
such transaction is a poke in the Hierarchy’s unlidded eye. Its 
true agenda, however, is nothing less than constantly making 
mortals aware of the possibility of life beyond death.

Factions
Haunters ally for mutual interest or shared breakage. The 

Pandemonium
Pandemonium Systems

scientifically-minded Mandelbrots seek new Arcanos mani-
festations that can manipulate and weaken the Shroud, 
or that affect the living so viscerally as to dissipate the 
Fog.  The  theologically-inclined  Dantes  explore  and 
study the Shadowlands in search of an escape route. 
The hedonistic Caligarians create “art” through 
the  transcendence  of  physical  laws,  inspiring 
mortals and fellow wraiths to beautiful insanity, 
while there’s nothing artistic or beautiful in the 
Bedlameers’ frothing assaults on mortal minds. 
The methodical and businesslike Order of 
the Glass Menagerie indirectly assaults the 
Shroud by working against the Fog, 
and its relative lucidity makes 
it the alliance least offen-
sive to aliens. The Guild’s 
“leaders,” such as they are, 
mockingly refer to themselves 
(this week) as the H.G. Dwellers. 
Hewing closest to the proto-Haunters’ 
original ethos, the Dwellers seek the 
Shroud’s destruction so that they may 
roll back time, rejoining the living 
by resuming their own lives.

While she’s in the Shadowlands, a Haunter can invoke 
Pandemonium effects in the Skinlands. She also can use these 
arts in the Tempest while she’s there. Skinlands manifestations 
are subject to the Fog and each roll’s difficulty equals the local 
Shroud. In Stygia and the Tempest, each roll’s difficulty is 6, 
but each die that comes up a one (even in a success) gives the 
wraith’s Shadow 1 temporary Angst in addition to any gained 

as part of the power’s usual cost.

Pandemonium and Oblivion interact strangely. In the 
Labyrinth, each roll’s difficulty is 6, each die that comes 
up a 10 counts as two successes, and each die that comes 
up a one or a two counts toward a botch. Botches on 
Pandemonium rolls in the Labyrinth are, in a word, 
epic. However, the Haunter’s Shadow never gains Angst 
from Pandemonium applications in the Labyrinth.
• Weirdness (Common)

The wraith inflicts a small, strange effect on 
a single living target. This art’s subject may shiver 
from sudden chills, see a flicker of motion where 
none should be, or feel the tickling feet of spiders 
nesting in his esophagus.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

THE WEIRD GO PRO

According  to  Haunter  lore,  the  guild’s 
forebears once quested deep in the Labyrinth, 
following legends of a weapon that could sunder 
the Shroud. Instead, they found a force called 
the  Wyld,  a  font  of  primal  chaos,  and  made 
a  pact  with  it.  In  exchange  for  a  portion  of 
its power, they would bind themselves to the 
Wyld’s own purpose of continuous dynamism. 
That  power  became  Pandemonium  and  the 
pact still drives the Haunters’ larger agenda of 
antiestablishment disruption.

The tale’s veracity is questionable but it’s 
true that certain Haunters have unlikely allies 
across the Shroud, particularly some factions of 
werewolves and fae. The idea of formal alliance 
or  large-scale  conspiracy  is  laughable,  but  on 
an individual basis, a wraith with ties to either 
party is more likely than not to be a Haunter. It’s 
an occasional source of common cause and an 
advantage few other groups of dead can predict 
or counter. On the downside, this also brings 
Haunters into more frequent conflict with mortal 
ghost hunters.

pools equal to the wraith’s dots in Pandemonium for one turn

affect the same target more than once per scene.
• Taste Chaos (Initiate)

The  wraith’s  affinity  for  chaos  enables  her  to  detect  its 
touch on others. This art’s capacity to reveal the influence not 
only of Pandemonium but also of Oblivion has implications 
that few Haunters want examined too closely…

System:  The  wraith  gazes  quizzically  at  a  target  within 
line of sight; the player rolls Wits + Pandemonium. One suc-
cess reveals if the target has been affected by Pandemonium, 
Spectre powers, or another manifestation of Oblivion within 
the past day. Each additional success reveals traces going back 
an additional week.
•• Befuddlement (Common)

The wraith momentarily confuses a target, disorienting him 
and making him forget where he is and what he’s doing. This 
art is equally effective on living and wraithly targets.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Wits + Pan-
demonium. For one turn per success, the target must succeed 
with an Intelligence roll (difficulty 8) to act or to maintain any 
supernatural power requiring concentration. Multiple applica-
tions of Befuddlement add to the effect’s duration.

•• Postmortemscript (Initiate)

A Haunter versed in this art can communicate across the 
Shroud via written words and symbols. Concentrating on her 
message and infusing her Corpus with chaos, she forces part of 
her substance through cracks in the walls between worlds, mark-
ing any solid surface. Pandemonium’s unpredictability makes 
each manifestation different: One message may appear in moss, 
another oozes from the writing surface in clotted blood, while 
glowing gnats hover to spell out a third. This also renders exact 
dictation impossible. With practice, the wraith can convey her 
intent with acceptable accuracy, though a slip in concentration 
can reveal her subconscious worries and desires or even allow 
her Shadow to dictate the message.

System: When the wraith begins writing, the player spends 
1 Pathos and 1 Corpus and rolls Intelligence + Pandemonium. 
She can write for one turn per success, with each turn allowing 
her to write one phrase or short sentence. All writing disappears 
at the end of the scene.
••• Strange Ether (Common)

The wraith can meddle with a small area’s environmental 
conditions, altering temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, 
and lighting conditions. While only the strongest Haunters can 
cause direct harm with Strange Ether, it’s easy to arrange “ac-
cidents” through localized meteorological anomalies. Strange 
Ether can alter the environment on either side of the Shroud, 
but  meddling  with  the  Tempest  is  an  act  of  desperation  or 
insanity even for Haunters.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and 1 Corpus and rolls 
Intelligence + Pandemonium. Her successes determine the most 
intense weather she can invoke, as shown below. All Strange 
Ether effects last for one minute per dot of Pandemonium in a 
radius up to the wraith’s Willpower x 10 yards.
1 success 
2 successes  Mild breeze and light precipitation.
3 successes  Ambient light change, in a range from “overcast 
winter morning” to “midnight under a stormy sky 
with a new moon.”

Fog or slight temperature change (up to 10ºF/5ºC).

4 successes  Strong wind and heavy precipitation.
5+ successes  As 4 successes, but each additional success grants 
one “ranged” attack with an airborne object; the 
player rolls Wits + Pandemonium with a base 1 
bashing damage.

Haunters can’t engage in Strange Ether duels to cancel out 
each other’s applications of this art; multiple uses only worsen 
conditions until they’re out of anyone’s control. In the Tem-
pest, any failed application of Strange Ether also generates an 
immediate localized Maelstrom (one bell, unless the situation 
demands something stronger).

205

THE GOING GETS WEIRD

A wraith invoking Pandemonium rarely has 
control over its precise manifestation. She can 
use a given art and have an idea of its net effect, 
but she doesn’t always know the specific form it’ll 
take. Storytellers and players are alike encouraged 
to take this as license to describe meat rain, ar-
chitectural eversions, and other phenomena that 
bury the needle on the weird-o-meter. When in 
doubt, err on the side of creepy over slapstick.

••• Escher’s Stair (Initiate)

This art momentarily violates Euclidean geometry, con-
necting two doorways or other portals to one another via the 
Labyrinth. This art can link a door to a window, a sewer pipe to 
a piece of playground equipment, or the head of the eponymous 
staircase to its foot. Such a link goes both ways. Anyone passing 
through it suffers a moment of unsettling disorientation as they 
transit the Labyrinth en route to their destination. Multiple 
applications  of  Escher’s  Stair  can  create  infinite  loops  —  or 
intricate mazes of twisty little passages, all alike.

System: The player spends 1 Corpus and 2 Pathos and rolls 
Wits + Pandemonium. For one turn per success, she can link 
two similar planes within her line of sight so any object cross-
ing one plane emerges from the other. Each plane must have 
a clearly defined border: a window frame, a doorway, the head 
or foot of a staircase or ladder, a tunnel mouth, a jet engine’s 
intake, and so on. The two planes don’t have to have identical 
dimensions or similar shapes, but must be roughly equal in area.
At Pandemonium ••••, the player may spend 1 Willpower 
to  expend  this  art’s  duration  to  one  minute  per  success.  At 
Pandemonium •••••, she may spend 2 Willpower to stretch 
it to one hour per success.

If a character suffers severe injury (more than 2 Health 
levels of lethal damage) from passing through Escher’s Stair, 
the wraith’s Shadow gains 4 temporary Angst.
•••• Foul Humor (Common)

Forcing her Corpus through the Shroud, the wraith creates 
a Fortean eruption of anything from vermin to gore. She can 
generate frog rains, locust plagues, wasp swarms, rat eruptions, 
spider explosions… the list goes on. Alternately, she can sum-
mon raw meat, fresh or clotted blood, slime molds, buckets of 
phlegm, acidic or caustic mucus, or other noxious substances.
System: The player describes her desired effect, spends 1 
Pathos and 1 Corpus, and rolls Intelligence + Pandemonium. 
The wraith’s Shadow then gains 1 temporary Angst, regardless of 
whether the roll is successful. The manifestation has a maximum 
radius of the wraith’s Pandemonium rating x 5 yards and lasts 
for three turns per success. If the effect is damaging, the wraith’s 

206

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Shadow gains 1 additional temporary Angst and the vermin 
or goo inflicts one level of lethal damage per two successes.

More subtle and less disruptive manifestations are possible, 
though they go against the forces upon which this art calls. 
Summoning  a  non-disgusting  substance  additionally  costs  1 
Willpower for the necessary fine control.
•••• Grotesque Apparition (Initiate)

Instead  of  sliming  or  infesting  an  area  with  her  cast-off 
Corpus, an adept Haunter can mold her cross-Shroud manifesta-
tion into an approximation of her mortal shape. This art spawns 
a short-lived, life-sized humanoid form that vaguely resembles 
the Haunter. It’s incapable of self-expression more refined than 
inchoate gibbering, but it’s distressingly robust and disgusting.
System:  The  player  spends  3  Corpus  and  2  Pathos  and 
rolls Intelligence + Pandemonium. The wraith’s Shadow gains 
1 temporary Angst. The manifestation lasts for one turn per suc-
cess. When the wraith creates the apparition, she sets its general 
behavior (including whether it attacks and, if so, whom), but she 
can’t subsequently control it — once unleashed, it’s self-directing.
The apparition has attributes equal to the wraith’s own, 
except Appearance, which is 0. It inherits her ability dots (if 
any) in Athletics, Brawl, Intimidation, Melee, Repair (usable 
only for sabotage), and Stealth. It has Health levels equal to 
the Haunter’s Stamina + Pandemonium. 

When creating the apparition, the player can spend extra 
Corpus to enhance its physical form. 1 point of Corpus buys 
one dot of Strength, one dot of Stamina, or 2 Health levels.
••••• Tempus Fugit (Common)

The wraith can distort time’s passage, slowing or hasten-
ing the actions of everyone in her immediate area. She can’t, 
however, reverse or repeat time.

System:  The  player  declares  whether  she’s  speeding  or 
slowing time, spends 4 Pathos and 1 Corpus, and rolls Wits 
+ Pandemonium. This art affects a maximum 10-yard radius 
and lasts for one turn per success. The player may exempt one 
character per dot of the wraith’s Wits, including the Haunter 
herself, declared when she activates this power.

If the wraith successfully slows time, all affected characters 
and objects slow to half their normal speed.  Slowed characters 
receive only one action every other turn, objects in motion move 
at half velocity, and slowed attacks’ damage dice pools decrease 
by 2. In addition, slowed characters can’t take defensive actions.

If the wraith speeds up time, all affected characters and 
objects double their speed. Accelerated characters receive one 
extra action per turn, objects in motion move at double veloc-
ity, and accelerated attacks’ damage dice pools increase by 2.

The player may spend 3 additional Corpus to slow time 
to one-third its normal pace or triple it. Slowed characters act 
once every three turns, while hastened characters receive two 
extra actions. All other effects are commensurate.

A wraith can use Tempus Fugit once per scene.

••••• Tesseract Bomb (Initiate)

If a Haunter wills it with this art, her wrath is inescap-
able. Folding an entire structure in on itself, the wraith blocks 
all egress and ingress. Within this nightmare geometry, dead 
ends, infinite loops, and gravitational reversals upend the laws 
of physics. There are no records of Tesseract Bomb’s effects in 
the Tempest or the Labyrinth, most likely because no one has 
survived to report the results — but it’s notable that a Haunter’s 
Shadow will do anything to prevent such experiments.

System: The wraith must be within the building, cavern, or 
other enclosed space she wants to Tesseract Bomb. The player 
spends 3 Pathos and 3 Corpus, then rolls Wits + Pandemonium. 
The number of successes rolled determine the maximum size 
of structure she can affect. If the target space is larger than the 
roll allows, she affects only a portion of it:
1 success 
Single room
2 successes  One-bedroom apartment; small shop
3 successes  One-story house
4 successes  Two- or three-story house; strip mall
5 successes  Mansion; parking garage; shopping mall

For the rest of the scene, no one on the outside can enter 
the affected structure. Entrances are stuck, locked, or impossible 
to find. Attempts at forced entry fail unless the attacker both 
succeeds at the appropriate task and defeats the Haunter in a 
resisted Willpower roll.

Inside the structure, exits simply aren’t there. Blank walls 
and dead-end hallways replace windows and outside doors, and 
exterior walls have armor equal to the Haunter’s Wits in addi-
tion to their usual properties. In addition, if the Haunter knows 
Dark Ether or Escher’s Stair, she can use each power without 
paying Pathos or Corpus while the Tesseract Bomb is in effect, 
though her Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst for each such use.

TRAITS

207

Sandmen

he “closest” most of the Quick ever come to 
truly entering the Underworld is when they 
sleep. Their dreams — or nightmares — 
carry them away from the tangible reality 
of the waking world and into a nether 
region  which  they  sometimes  find 
comforting, sometimes horrifying, 

as a method of divination, spirit travel, and even attack. So, 
naturally, some of the first wraiths explored the relationship 
between their existence and the world of dreams in an effort 
to comprehend both. In time, these studies yielded the arts 

now known as Phantasm.

and sometimes just bizarre as their subconscious plays 
hob  with  them.  While  they  exist  in  this  shifting 
lands of dream they come near to the Shadowlands 
— so near that certain wraiths can work their 
will upon them. These wraiths, the Sandmen, 
use the Arcanos of Phantasm to manipulate 
dreams — and the dreamers who spawn them.

Guildmarks
Just as a person who tromps through 

marshes gets wet and muddy, a Sand-
man who glides through the morphean 
landscape becomes marked by dream-
stuff — and that marking never entirely 
disappears. At the lower levels of power, 
fragmented scenes from dreams currently 
experienced  by  nearby  sleeping  mortals 
play out across his eyes. As he becomes more 
powerful, the “screen” expands to cover first 
his face, and eventually his whole body.

Additionally, most of the schools within the 

Guild (see below) adopt emblems or symbols that 
have special meaning for them. For example, mem-
bers of the School of Guignol often paint a circle of 
blood (or at least blood-red makeup) around one eye, 
while the Dreamaturges use the traditional comic-tragic 
masques associated with theater.
The Guild

Dreams  have  always  had  something  of  a  mystical  qual-
ity  for  humanity,  with  shaman  and  priest  alike  using  them 

Phantasm’s  artistic  potential  attracted  many  like-
minded wraiths. They gathered in appropriate Haunts 
and supportive Necropoli to practice their Arcanos, 
share  techniques,  and  argue  aesthetics  and  phi-
losophy. Over time, these groups coalesced into 
Circles often referred to as schools or “schola.” 
Despite  the  frequent,  and  loudly  voiced,  dif-
ferences  between  schools,  their  shared  love 
of art and appreciation for creativity drew 
them together. In time the Sandmen, as 
other wraiths called them, weren’t very 

different from the other Guilds.

The centuries prior to the Break-
ing were a golden age of Phantasm. 
Every  Deathlord,  Anacreon,  and 
wealthy  wraith  competed  to  hire  the 
most talented Sandmen to create “Oneiric 
Theatre.” But some Hierarchy leaders real-
ized that a Sandman who fooled an audience 
could  just  as  easily  dupe  an  unwary  wraith 
out of his oboli or perform espionage missions. 
They persuaded or forced some Sandmen into 
these unsavory pursuits, and the Guild’s reputation 
was soon tainted by its association with theft and 
blackmail. But thanks to their newfound wealth and 
influence, many Sandmen didn’t care.

When the Breaking came, it lived up to its name 
with regard to the Sandmen. The Guild splintered along 
aesthetic lines, as old rivalries led some Sandmen to join 
the revolt and others to help Charon and his Legions. Even 
after the turmoil passed, the Guild didn’t merge back into a 
unified organization; the Sandmen remained content to stay 
in their countless squabbling schools.

208

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

These days, provided a Sandman restricts herself to satisfying 
her fans’ desire for entertainment the Legions pay no attention 
when she works. (For Sandmen who prefer not to restrict them-
selves, the realm of dreams provides a convenient place to meet 
and plan away from the Hierarchy’s prying eyes — usually.) And 
as every wraith knows, sometimes one has a need — personal 
or otherwise — that only a Sandman can supply.

Factions
The Sandmen have always been highly factional-

ized, but over time the passing of key artistic figures 
into Oblivion, the falling out of favor of some 
styles of art, the evolution of aesthetic doctrines, 
and other factors have winnowed the vast number 
of  “schools”  that  existed  before  the  Breaking 
down to a much smaller count. Broadly speaking, 
though, all of them fall into two categories: 
the  “aesthetic”  schools,  which  tend  to 

focus on art and questions of creativity 
and style; and the “practical” schools, 
which seek more… efficient… ways 
to use Phantasm to personal benefit. 
Into the former category fall the School 
of Dreamaturgy, whose members attempt 
to raise Oneiric Theatre to the creative 
heights and prestige it once enjoyed; the 
School of Guignol, known more commonly 
as “Night Terrors” or “Nightriders,” which 
specializes in the creation of nightmares 
and similar horrific dreams; and the School 
of Meditation, which explores the sacred 
and mystical nature of dreaming. The lat-
ter includes the School of Oneironmancy, 
or Oneiromancers, which engages in spy-
ing, espionage, and dream-based combat; 
and the School of Beguilement, Renegades 
kicked out of the Guild who claim they’re 
the real Guild. The Beguilers pretend to be 
entertainers but are really scam artists, con 
wraiths, and hustlers employing Phantasm 
for personal gain.

Phantasm
Phantasm Systems

Unless an art specifies differently, if a wraith uses Phantasm 
across the Shroud, the local Shroud rating is the difficulty. Us-
ing Phantasm on a target in the Underworld has a difficulty of 
the target’s Willpower unless noted otherwise.

Failures on Phantasm rolls often have particularly disturb-
ing or horrific effects (unless that was the wraith’s intent in the 
first place). Dreams and illusions spiral out of control, becom-
ing nightmarish, and often taking as their subject the wraith’s 
Passions (or his Shadow’s Dark Passions). In some cases, the 
wraith’s Shadow may take over his manipulation of a dream or 
subject, leading to a truly nightmarish experience.

• Sleepsense (Common)

One  of  the  foundations  of  Phantasm  is  the  abil-
ity to watch the dreams a mortal or 
Slumbering  wraith  experiences, 
and in the case of the 
Quick  to  determine 
what  stage  of  sleep 
they’re in (non-REM 
(“N”)  stages,  where 
sleep gradually deepens 
but no dreams occur, fol-
lowed by REM sleep, in which 
dreaming  takes  place).  Sleepsense  also  allows  a  wraith 
to  perceive  whether  a  wraith  is  Slumbering  inside  an 
object  (and  thus  whether  that  object  is  one  of  that 
wraith’s Fetters).

System: For a wraith to spy on someone’s dreams, the 
player rolls Perception + Phantasm (difficulty 6). Each 
success allows the wraith to watch the dream for one turn.
For a wraith to determine if another wraith’s Slum-
bering  inside  an  object,  the  player  rolls  Perception  + 
Phantasm  (difficulty  equal  to  the  Slumbering  wraith’s 
Willpower or Pathos, whichever is higher). Even one net 
success lets him perceive whether there’s a Slumbering 
wraith there or not.
• Dreamreading (Initiate)

Dreams often contain prophetic or useful informa-
tion, and many wraiths have some ability to discern a 
dream’s meaning. A Sandman skilled at Dreamreading 
has far greater oneiromantic insight than his fellows.

System: When the wraith wants to discern what a 
dream means (either one of his own, or someone else’s that 
he watches via Sleepsense), the player rolls Perception + 
Phantasm (difficulty 6). Each success adds one success to 
the wraith’s ability to interpret dreams correctly.

TRAITS

209

•• Dreamweaver (Common)

••• Morphean Embrace (Common)

From watching dreams, most Sandmen go on to learn how 
to  alter  them.  Typically  a  wraith  does  this  to  communicate 
information  or  try  to  subtly  influence  the  sleeper’s  behavior 
once he wakes up.

Given  enough  successes,  a  wraith  can  change  virtually 
anything, or everything, about a dream. For example, if a wraith’s 
victim dreams of being a rock star playing a nighttime concert 
to a packed stadium, she could change it to a classical music 
performance, the stadium to an amphitheater, nighttime to day, 
the fans to tomato-throwing haters, and/or the good weather to 
a rainstorm. At the extreme, she could transform an ordinary 
dream into a nightmare that will haunt the victim when he 
awakens and prevent sleep from doing him any good.

System: For a wraith to alter a dream, he pays 2 Pathos 
and the player rolls Manipulation + Phantasm. The difficulty 
depends on the extent of the changes he wants to make: A 
few trivial changes is difficulty 3, changing half the significant 
details is difficulty 5, and changing all the significant details 
is difficulty 7.

Changing a dream has no specific game effect. How the 
sleeper reacts, if at all, is up to the Storyteller. However, it’s 
possible for a wraith to alter a dream so that it becomes a ter-
rifying nightmare. This increases the roll to difficulty 8 or the 
target’s Willpower (whichever is higher). Each success achieved 
reduces the Corpus a wraith regains from Slumber by 1. If used 
on one of the Quick, the effects are the same as the “sleepless-
ness” function of Oneirataxia (see below).

The more successes a Sandman achieves on a Dreamweaver 
roll, the more vivid the changes to the dream seem, and the 
longer they last.
•• Dream Sequence (Initiate)

When one of the Quick pierces the Fog (see p. 284) and 
perceives a wraith, it can pose difficulty and even danger. Some 
Sandmen can cloud a mortal’s mind again, convincing him that 
what  he  saw  “was  just  a  dream.”  Powerful  wraiths  can  even 
extend this effect to other supernatural beings.

System: After a mortal succeeds at seeing through the Fog, 
the player rolls Manipulation + Phantasm (difficulty equal to the 
mortal’s Willpower). Each success achieved reduces the mortal’s 
successes on his Perception + Alertness roll to perceive nearby 
wraiths. If this reduces the mortal’s success to zero or below, he 
becomes convinced that he didn’t actually see anything — he 
just had a particularly vivid dream (or hallucination).

Against  a  supernatural  being,  Dream  Sequence  doesn’t 
require the Fog; the Sandman just convinces another wraith, 
Spectre, or the like that he didn’t see something he did. The 
Sandman must have three dots in Phantasm to do this to wraiths, 
Spectres, and most other Underworld denizens, and four dots 
to use Dream Sequence against Skinlands supernatural entities. 

A Sandman with this art can make other wraiths fall asleep, 

just as if they were mortal once more.

System: Morphean Embrace costs 1 Pathos to use. If the 
target  wraith  wants  to  experience  Morphean  Embrace,  the 
Sandman’s player doesn’t need to roll to succeed with this art. 
But if the Sandman uses it against an involuntary subject (such 
as an enemy in combat), the player rolls Perception + Phantasm 
(difficulty of the target’s Willpower); the target may resist with 
an opposed Intelligence + Subterfuge roll.

If the roll succeeds, the target falls into an ordinary sleep. 
This isn’t Slumber, and he doesn’t enter one of his Fetters or 
regain Corpus Levels. Instead, he just drops to the ground and 
starts snoozing. Anything that would awaken a mortal sleeper 
(such as a loud noise or jostling him) will awaken a sleeping 
wraith as well. Unless something like that happens, the target 
wakes up about eight hours later.

A Sandman can use Oneirataxia (see below) on a sleeping 

wraith to keep him from waking up.
••• Deep Slumber (Initiate)

A wraith under the effects of Deep Slumber recovers Corpus 

more quickly when Slumbering.

System: A Sandman can use this art on himself before he 
Slumbers, or on another wraith while that wraith Slumbers. 
The player rolls Intelligence + Phantasm (difficulty 7). Each 
success achieved adds to the number of levels of non-aggravated 
damage the Slumbering subject heals. These extra levels ap-
ply even if the subject fails his Stamina roll after Slumbering 
(unless he botches).
•••• Phantasmagoria (Common)

Often  considered  the  true  height  of  the  Sandman’s  art, 
Phantasmagoria allows a wraith to weave Pathos into convinc-
ing illusions. 

System:  Using  Phantasmagoria  costs  3  Pathos,  plus  an 
additional 1 Pathos per turn to maintain the illusion, if desired.
To create an illusion, the player rolls Perception + Phan-
tasm (difficulty 6), with the number of successes indicating two 
things: the maximum number of turns the illusion can last, and 
the number of successes anyone who sees it needs to achieve on 
a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 6) to resist its effects. 
If a victim achieves that many successes or more, he realizes 
the illusion is just that, an illusion, and can safely ignore it. 
Otherwise, he thinks it’s real and reacts accordingly. If given 
reason to suspect the image isn’t real (for example, if an illusion-
ary loved one doesn’t act affectionately toward him), he gets to 
make another Perception + Awareness roll to see through it.

Phantasmagoria  affects  sight,  hearing,  taste,  and  smell. 
The wraith can even make it quasi-solid to other wraiths, and 
thus able to affect touch, by investing it with Corpus. For each 

210

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

1 Corpus the Sandman “donates” to her illusion, it acquires 
one health level. A Sandman cannot “heal” her illusion after 
something damages it. If she wants a more solid illusion she 
has to create a new one.

A Corpus-invested illusion can cause damage, if appropriate 
(e.g., an illusionary weapon). To do this, the player rolls Dexter-
ity + Phantasm (difficulty 7) to hit the target (the target can 
dodge). If the attack hits, roll Strength + Phantasm (difficulty 
7). Each success inflicts one point of damage.

A Sandman can only create illusions in the Underworld 
unless she can Embody, in which case she can create them in 
the Skinlands as well.
•••• Tableau Of Terror (Initiate)

Some  Sandmen  have  made  special  study  of  the  art  of 
Phantasmagoria (see above) in an effort to make their illusions 
more effective for specific purposes. The best known result of 
this work is Tableau of Terror, which creates an illusion so ter-
rifying, horrifying, or simply disturbing that anyone viewing it 
runs screaming in fear.

System: The wraith spends 2 Pathos (plus an additional 
1  Pathos  per  turn  to  maintain  the  Tableau,  if  desired).  The 
player rolls Perception + Phantasm (difficulty 5). The number 
of successes indicates two things: the maximum number of turns 
the Tableau can last and the number of successes anyone who 
sees it needs to achieve on a Wits + Awareness roll (difficulty 
6) to resist its effects.

Anyone  who  fails  to  achieve  this  number  of  successes 
experiences extreme fear. If he fails by just 1–2, the victim just 
flees as fast as he can. If he fails by 3–4 his Shadow also gains 1 
temporary Angst and he may attack in a frenzy instead of flee-
ing. If he fails by 5 or more, he becomes paralyzed or catatonic 
from fear and can’t do anything.

Unlike a full illusion created by Phantasmagoria, a Tableau 
of Terror cannot be made solid by investing it with Corpus. 
It’s just a highly convincing image crafted as a specific effect.
••••• Agon (Common)

The deadliest of the Sandman’s arts, Agon allows a wraith 
to rip the soul from a sleeping mortal’s body, causing excruciat-
ing, often debilitating, pain.

System: The wraith must spend 3 Pathos to use Agon, and 
his Shadow also gains 2 Angst when he does. The player rolls 
Perception + Phantasm (difficulty 8 or the local Shroud rating, 
whichever’s higher). The number of successes indicates (a) the 
number of turns the wraith may hold the victim’s soul out of 
his body, and (b) the number of health levels the victim loses 
when he awakens. However, the victim may resist this injury 
by rolling Wits + Subterfuge (difficulty 8).

••••• Oneirataxia (Initiate)

Also known as Sleep Manipulation (or, to less respectful 
wraiths, Insomnia Bomb), Oneirataxia allows a wraith to prevent 
the Quick and wraiths from sleeping, waking up, or dreaming.
System: Oneirataxia has three functions. Using any one 
of them costs 2 Pathos; if a wraith uses two or more functions 
simultaneously on the same subject, each additional one costs 
another 1 Pathos.

First, a wraith can use this art to prevent a mortal from 
sleeping  or  a  wraith  from  Slumbering.  The  player  rolls  Ma-
nipulation + Phantasm against a difficulty of 8 or the target’s 
Willpower,  whichever’s  higher.  Success  indicates  the  target 
can’t sleep for 24 hours. 

For the Quick, lack of sleep reduces the victim’s actions by 1 
die on each day that follows until she gets sound, uninterrupted 
sleep. The Sandman’s player may also apply an additional 1 die 
reduction for every 2 extra successes on the roll. (A Sandman 
can only use this type of Oneirataxia on a particular subject 
once each time she sleeps, but the effect is cumulative if applied 
on successive nights.) Furthermore, if the penalty equals the 
subject’s highest Attribute + Ability combination, the subject 
experiences a nervous breakdown and requires medical assis-
tance or even temporary institutionalization. Extended exposure 
past this point sends the subject into permanent catatonia. A 
wraith may try to combat this art by using Dreamweaver (p. 
210) during the subject’s nightmare.

For a wraith, the inability to Slumber means he cannot 
regain  Corpus  that  way.  A  use  of  Morphean  Embrace  on  a 
wraith affected by this type of Oneirataxia must achieve more 
successes with its roll than the Oneirataxia attack or it fails to 
affect the wraith.

Second, a wraith can prevent a sleeper from waking up. 
This keeps the Quick in a coma-like state and puts a Slumbering 
wraith into forced “hibernation.” The player rolls Manipulation 
+ Phantasm against a difficulty of 7 or the target’s Willpower, 
whichever’s higher. Each success indicates that the sleep/Slumber 
continues for one 12-hour period. A botch on this roll typically 
makes the Sandman himself go to sleep for 12 hours.

Third, a wraith can prevent a mortal from dreaming while he 
sleeps. (This function doesn’t work on the Restless.) While this 
may affect the victim’s behavior differently, the game effects are 
the same as lack of sleep (see above), and the wraith’s Shadow 
gains 1 point of Permanent Angst when the mortal goes mad.
A Sandman may use two or more functions of Oneirataxia 
on  a  target  simultaneously.  This  increases  the  difficulty  for 
all rolls to the highest of any of them, +1 for each additional 
function used.

Puppeteers

ultures  around  the  world  have  myths  of 
possession.  Gods,  spirits,  demons,  and 
ancestors  speak  through  the  mouths  of 
the living. Some reach into the mortal 
realm  to  harm,  others  to  offer  aid. 
Scratch  any  of  these  stories,  the 
Puppeteers  say,  and  you’ll  find 

one of their number. They’ve been practicing their 
arts for millennia, leaving their mark on countless 
civilizations and religions.

The masters of Puppetry exaggerate slightly. 

They  have  no  monopoly  on  the  power  to 
enter and control mortal bodies. However, 
few others have mastered both the degree 
of control that Puppetry grants and the 
understanding of human behavior and 
superstition that allows for most effec-
tive possession. 

This Arcanos doesn’t just cross 
the Shroud. It usurps mortals’ bodies 
and, with some greater arts, their very 
lives. Puppetry abuse feeds the Shadow 
and is one of the empire’s most-loathed 
violations  of  the  Dictum  Mortuum.  The 
dangers don’t stop wraiths from seeking out 
tutelage, though. The renewal of living sensa-
tion that Skinriding brings is stronger than any 
voice in the wraith’s head or Hierarchy official’s 
disapproval.
Guildmarks
Puppeteers take on so many other forms that they 

can lose their own. Each Puppeteer’s Corpus gradually 
becomes a blend of his hosts’ appearances. Puppeteers who 
possess a wide range of subjects melt into an indistinct aver-
age appearance that approaches an uncanny valley of human 
norms. Those who specialize in a particular class of host undergo 
similar transformations, but with a bias toward their preferred 

vessels. Wraiths fond of possessing inhuman subjects become 
gradually less human-looking themselves, reflecting the physical 
traits of animals or the spiritual traits of supernatural hosts.
The Guild

Until the empire’s rise, Puppeteers were solitary crea-
tures, each pursuing their own agenda among the Quick. 
Cult figureheads, oracular voices, and ancestral guides, 
they chose and shepherded mortal herds for their own 
ends. Stygia’s ascent ended these practices. Even 
before laying down the Dictum Mortuum, Charon 
loathed Puppetry for its direct power over the 
living. Early Puppeteers banded together for 
self-preservation, becoming early adopters of 
the Guild structure to attain the political 

power to deter the Hierarchy.

Puppeteer lore blames Charon for 
engineering  their  downfall  through 
sleeper agents. Over several centu-
ries,  these  wraiths  rose  to  positions 
of  prominence,  with  one  eventually 
attaining  overall  Guild  leadership.  His 
deliberate sabotage during the War of the 
Guilds undercut Puppeteer efforts and lost 
centuries of knowledge to the Artificers’ forges. 
He disappeared near the war’s end, mission ap-
parently accomplished.

Outrage over Charon’s perfidy put the Puppe-
teers at the forefront of the coup, but the absence of 
senior leadership hobbled them. The Breaking finished 
what the war had started, scattering the Puppeteers into 
reclusive groups that limited themselves to protecting 
(or exploiting) specific mortal cultures. Only recently have 
leaders with less insular perspectives emerged to reunite the 
Guild’s scattered fragments. Most are young wraiths who lived 
and  died  in  an  era  of  global  travel  and  telecommunication, 
making them more open to interacting with cultures beyond 
those of their respective births.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Factions

Until recently, Puppeteers collected in small, local Circles, each one drawing recruits from a 
particular subculture or group and focusing its activities on those mortals. Mistrust of higher authority 
ran deep, a legacy of the damage Charon’s deep-cover agents inflicted. Circles might occasionally meet 
to exchange information or collaborate on critical projects, but extended contact was anathema.

This changed in the 20th century as wraiths without the old scars rose to local leadership. The 
Fourth and Fifth Great Maelstroms underscored the need for direct intervention to prevent the Quick 
from destroying the Skinlands and Underworld alike. Postwar migrations also forced many 
Circles to follow their mortal beneficiaries, reestablishing themselves in foreign cities and 
citadels. Greater cross-cultural contact led to the Marionette movement among Circle 
leaders who consider themselves citizens of the world. Under their idealistic influence, 
the Guild reaches toward greater coordination, including the mitigation of wars that 
could threaten a Sixth Great Maelstrom.

Not every Puppeteer is so altruistic. Most cities have at least one Circle that wants 
no part of lofty agendas, preferring to aid only its chosen mortals. Resistance 
to a greater Guild structure ranges from parochial rhetoric to bloody assaults 
on Fetters, depending on the personalities involved.

Other goals drive Puppeteers, too. The Harlequins never forgot 
Charon’s  acts  and  maintain  a  centuries-old  terror  campaign 
against the Hierarchy, exploiting mortal extremist groups to 
strike Fetters. Conversely, Silhouettes see Puppetry as a means 
to  Transcendence  through  resolving  Fetters,  sometimes  ap-

proaching religious mania on the subject.

Puppetry
Puppetry Systems

Puppetry works only on living humans with no supernatural quali-
ties (unless the Puppeteer knows Menagerie Mask). Unless otherwise 
specified, each Puppetry art’s difficulty is equal to the local Shroud. 
Any nonconsensual use of the art allows the subject to resist with 
his Willpower. All rolls are at difficulty 6 unless otherwise stated.
Unless otherwise indicated, every Puppetry art other than 

Skinride requires the wraith to be Skinriding her target.

While a wraith is Skinriding, she’s considered to be fully in 
the Skinlands. She’s immune to any event in the Shadowlands 
(except Arcanoi that can reach across the Shroud). However, 
she suffers the same Skinlands effects as her host. This extends 
to injury: Whenever the host receives damage, the Puppeteer 
suffers an equal amount of the same type.
• Skinride (Common)

The  foundation  upon  which  all  greater  Puppetry  arts 
build,  Skinride  enables  the  Puppeteer  to  slip  into  a  mortal’s 
body, briefly inhabiting his flesh as a passenger. The wraith has no 
control over her vessel’s actions or thoughts. However, most other 
Puppetry arts require the wraith to be Skinriding her target. Only 
one wraith at a time may Skinride any given target.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Strength + 
Puppetry. With success, the wraith inhabits the host’s body for 
the rest of the scene. If another wraith is already Skinriding 
the host, the Puppeteer must beat his successes to eject him 
and usurp his place.

TRAITS

213

• Menagerie Mask (Initiate)

••• Master’s Voice (Common)

Menagerie Mask expands the range of subjects that the 
Puppeteer can Skinride, allowing her to inhabit both animals 
and supernatural beings.

The Puppeteer can briefly seize control of her host’s capac-
ity for speech. The result is an eerie blend of the wraith’s and 
host’s voices.

System: Upon learning Menagerie Mask, the Puppeteer 
can use Skinride on all primates, as well as supernaturally-gifted 
mortals. Further proficiency comes as the wraith increases her 
mastery of Puppetry.

At Puppetry ••, the character may Skinride all mammals.
Puppetry ••• enables the wraith to Skinride birds. 
With  Puppetry  ••••,  the  Puppeteer  can  Skinride  fish, 

reptiles, and amphibians. 

A character must learn Skinride before acquiring Menagerie 
Mask. This is an exception to the usual rules governing the 
purchase of Initiate arts.
•• Twitch (Common)

The wraith may take fleeting control of one of her host’s 
limbs.  While  complex  manipulation  is  beyond  her,  she  can 
grasp or release an object, cause or prevent a fall, or cause brief 
paralysis to forestall an attack or other action.

System:  The  player  spends  1  Pathos  and  rolls  Strength 
+  Puppetry.  If  the  host  resists,  the  wraith’s  Shadow  gains  1 
temporary Angst. 

Success allows brief control (one turn) as described above. 
With  three  or  more  successes,  the  movement  feels  entirely 
natural and the host writes it off to a muscle spasm, momentary 
indecision, or other internal factor.
•• Admix Humors (Initiate)

This art lets the Puppeteer influence her host’s involuntary 
muscles and other bodily functions. She can adjust respiration, 
heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, blood chemistry, peristalsis, 
adrenaline production, and various secretions, and can smooth 
or exacerbate microexpressions. Subtle applications of Admix 
Humors  can  affect  polygraph  results,  sustained  exertion,  or 
social  interactions.  More  vigorous  adjustments  can  simulate 
illness or trigger explosive voiding.

System: The player chooses the change she wants to invoke, 
spends 2 Pathos, and rolls Stamina + Puppetry. With success, 
she applies one of the following effects to her host:
•  Add or subtract one die per 2 successes to all Strength and 

Stamina pools for the rest of the scene.

•  Add or subtract one die per 2 successes to all social pools 

for the rest of the scene.

•  Simulate the symptoms of one particular illness unless an 
observer succeeds in an opposed Perception + Medicine roll.
•  Trigger sneezing, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, or similar 

• 

involuntary effects.
Inflict 1 health level of bashing damage.
If the host resists, the Puppeteer’s Shadow gains 2 tem-

porary Angst.

214

System: The player spends 1 Pathos and rolls Stamina + 
Puppetry. If the host resists, the Puppeteer’s Shadow gains 2 tem-
porary Angst. The wraith may speak for one breath per success.
••• Shared Blood, Shared Breath (Initiate)

If a wraith’s host suffers damage while she’s Skinriding him, 
she shares his injuries. This art enables her to heal her host’s 
body along with her own Corpus. 

System:  When  healing  damage  the  wraith  incurred  as 
a result of her host receiving damage, the player may double 
the normal Pathos expenditure and spend 1 Willpower. The 
wraith’s host is healed of the same amount of damage that the 
wraith herself heals.

Shared Blood, Shared Breath can’t heal aggravated damage. 

In addition, this art is effective only for a Consort.
•••• Rein in the Mind (Common)

With  this  art,  the  Puppeteer  takes  complete  control  of 
her host’s body. The host remains in a semiconscious dream 
state, aware of what’s happening but unable to act. When the 
wraith releases control, the host is subject to the Fog and reacts 
appropriately.

System: The player spends 4 Pathos and rolls Stamina + 
Puppetry. The wraith’s Shadow gains 1 temporary Angst if the 
host is willing, 4 temporary Angst if he resists. The wraith gains 
total control for one scene per success.

Once per scene, the host may spend 1 Willpower to make an 
opposed Willpower roll against the wraith’s Stamina + Puppetry. 
Each net success the host receives reduces the art’s duration by 
one scene. In addition, regardless of who rolls more successes, 
spending the Willpower gives the host one turn of control of 
his own body and gives the wraith’s Shadow 1 temporary Angst.
If the host is a Consort, the wraith makes all rolls with the 
host’s Physical Attributes and Appearance. If the host is not a 
Consort, all Physical and Appearance-based rolls use either the 
wraith’s attribute or the host’s, whichever is lower.
•••• Revivify (Initiate)

This art’s name is misleading. The Puppeteer can’t return 
the dead to life. She can, however, inhabit and control a freshly 
dead corpse for a brief time — long enough to terrify witnesses 
or wreak horrifying damage.

System: Although Skinride normally works only on living 
hosts, learning Revivify allows the wraith to use it on a rela-
tively intact human body that has been dead no longer than 
a number of hours equal to her Stamina. The player spends 3 
Pathos and 1 Willpower and rolls Strength + Puppetry. The 
wraith’s  Shadow  gains  2  temporary  Angst  plus  1  additional 
temporary Angst per success.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

For two turns per success, the wraith gains total control 
of the corpse. She uses the host body’s Physical Attributes and 
Appearance for all appropriate rolls, but suffers a five-die wound 
penalty, reduced by one die per 2 successes.

While the host body is animate, it remains dead. Its heart 
does not beat, it does not respire unless the wraith consciously 
draws breath to speak, and the structural effects of all previously-
received wounds remain in effect. It has a number of health 
levels equal to the wraith’s Willpower. It suffers damage only 
from sources that affect its structural integrity. For example, 
poison is ineffective, but a shotgun blows off meaty chunks as 
usual. The wraith shares damage the body suffers, as per normal 
uses of Puppetry.
••••• Obliterate the Soul (Common)

Obliterate the Soul takes the process of creating a Consort 
to its logical and horrifying extreme. The Puppeteer assumes 
ownership of the host’s body, feeding his Psyche to her Shadow. 
The result is an uninhabited mortal husk with no capacity to resist 
the wraith’s Puppetry arts. It’s a perfect vessel for extended oc-
cupancy — until the inevitable process of physical decay sets in.
System:  Obliterate  the  Soul  is  usable  only  on  a  mortal 
Consort with no other supernatural qualities. Once per month, 
the player spends 5 Pathos and 2 Willpower and rolls Strength 
+ Puppetry. This is an extended roll. If she misses a month, she 
loses all accumulated successes. If she botches a roll, the subject 
becomes immune to all further uses of Obliterate the Soul. When 
she accumulates successes equal to the host’s Willpower, she 
succeeds. Her Shadow devours the host’s soul, gaining temporary 
Angst equal to three times the host’s permanent Willpower.

The Puppeteer may Skinride the uninhabited host body at 
will without spending Pathos. The body remains a Consort for 
all other purposes. When inhabiting the body, the wraith makes 
all rolls with the host’s Physical Attributes and Appearance. 
While the body is uninhabited, it is catatonic.

Oblivion takes its toll. After a number of days equal to 
the wraith’s Willpower, the wraith’s Shadow gains 1 temporary 
Angst. The body suffers one health level of aggravated damage 
and loses one dot of Appearance (minimum Appearance 0). 
This damage can’t be healed and additional damage continues 
to accrue at the same interval until the body dies.
••••• Legion (Initiate)

Repeated use of Puppetry leaves trace spiritual connections 
between the Puppeteer and her hosts. With Legion, she can 
exploit that network, asserting limited control over multiple 
Consorts at once. This is a profoundly dangerous art as each 
use feeds the wraith’s Shadow, and loss of control can give it 
free rein over several mortal bodies.

System: While the wraith is Skinriding one Consort, the 
player spends 3 Pathos and 1 Willpower for every other Consort 
present in the scene. If any Consorts want to resist Legion, the 
Storyteller makes a single roll for all of them, using the highest 
Willpower among the resisting characters.

If the wraith succeeds, she may direct the actions of all 
Consorts for one turn per success, plus one turn per dot of Leader-
ship. This direction is considered her action for each turn. Each 
Consort follows her directives to the best of his ability, using 
his normal dice pools, with a two-die penalty if he’s resisting.
While commanding her Legion, the wraith may speak with 
their  voices.  Her  words  emanate  from  all  affected  Consorts 
simultaneously.  In  addition,  she  may  spend  1  Willpower  to 
switch bodies as a free action, though this requires a successful 
Skinride application. If she fails, she remains in the body she’s 
currently Skinriding.

Killing the host body, knocking it unconscious, or driving 

the Puppeteer out of it immediately ends Legion’s effects.

Usurers

n death as in life, nothing’s free. Pathos serves 
as the Underworld’s purest currency, and 
trade in it is possible only through Usury. 
Without  this  Arcanos,  the  Stygian 
economy would grind to a halt — or, 
worse, devolve to hinging solely on 
relic barter and oboli. With Usury, 

rent with the invention of symbolic currency and commercial 
record-keeping in the early Bronze Age. These claims’ accuracy 
is widely debated, even among modern Usurers themselves, 
but it’s no surprise that meticulous documentation remains 

common among students of Usury.

a  wraith  can  serve  as  healer,  banker,  beggar,  loan 
shark, and more — all in the same day.

As an art of directly controlling the energy of 

the Underworld, Usury can be as unnerving as 
it is essential. Careless applications can rapidly 
generate Angst, strengthening the Shadow. 
Using it to draw energy from the Quick is 
nothing less than the theft of life itself, 
no matter what spin the wraith puts on 
his actions. Experienced Usurers know 
the  price  of  their  arts.  Experienced 
Usurers also are the Usurers who’ve 
survived their formative excesses and 
enthusiasms, and come to grips with 
what exactly they’re doing.

Guildmarks
Usury  demands  precision  from  those 

who  engage  in  its  delicate  give  and  take. 
Wraiths skilled in this Arcanos find their skin 
covered in a series of intricate markings. These 
patterns  are  in  constant  motion,  momentarily 
resolving into the mathematical or currency symbols 
of the wraith’s mortal culture before the slate wipes 
itself clean for the next equation.
The Guild

In their heyday, the Usurers enjoyed considerable 
political strength. Recognizing that any currency system 
breaks down if its controllers lose public trust, Guild 
leaders ruthlessly enforced a code of honesty and 
accountability.  The  image  of  the  incorruptible 
Usurer  enabled  the  Guild  to  extend  its  reach 
from traffic in Pathos and Corpus to most other 
Underworld  commerce,  then  into  Stygian 
courts. By the War of the Guilds, Usurers 
were  firmly  entrenched  in  the  empire’s 
legal system and refused to jeopardize 
this  position  of  power  by  aiding  the 
other Guilds.

Such  recalcitrance  cost  the 
Usurers  the  regard  of  their  peers. 
Joining the coup against Charon was a 
survival gamble, balancing the threat of 
Hierarchy reprisals against the certainty of 
expungement if the Guilds won. The Usu-
rers’ support was never more than token, and 
their early withdrawal hamstrung the revolt. 
But even this slight participation was enough to 
doom the Guild, as Charon proved willing to gut 
his own judiciary and economy if doing so removed 

another Guild from power.
Factions

The  Usurers’  greatest  regret  of  the  Breaking  is  the 

destruction of their archives. According to Guild lore, these 
records  contained  not  only  centuries  of  transactions,  but 
historical  accounts  of  the  organization’s  founding,  concur-

Bereft  of  their  Hierarchy  offices  and  targets  for 
resentful  members  of  other  Guilds,  few  Usurer  leaders 
survived  the  Breaking’s  fallout,  and  the  guild  splintered. 
Individual  Usurers  today  face  an  uphill  battle  to  establish 
personal reputations for integrity. In the face of lingering mis-
trust, many forsake their heritage in favor of expediency and

personal profit. Among the exceptions are two of the Guild’s 
three extant orders. The Vault of Breath includes those Usurers 
who practice healing — not only the transfer of raw Corpus 
but the study of afflictions caused by Arcanoi, Spectres, 
and more outré sources. The Vault of Bone still clings 
to  its  duty  of  enforcing  the  Usurers’  ancient  checks 
and  balances,  and  strives  to  restore  some  portion  of 
the Usurers’ former respect. Bereft of official backing, 
though, its members have little power to bring violators 
into line. Its nemesis is the fallen and feared Vault of 
Eyes, still intimately familiar with Stygian law 
but now committed to subverting rather than 
enforcing it. Wraiths of this order are crime 
lords acknowledged as formidable by even 
the most vicious Spooks.

Usury
Usury Systems

Unless  otherwise  stated,  each 
Usury art requires the wraith to touch 
his target. To affect a Skinlands sub-
ject,  this  requires  another  Arcanos 
(e.g.,  Embody,  Inhabit,  Phantasm, 
Puppetry) that facilitates either physi-
cal or spiritual contact. All rolls are 
at difficulty 6 unless stated otherwise.
• Appraisal (Common)

Knowing another being’s physical 
and spiritual state is key to manipulat-
ing its life and death energies. While all 
wraiths have some facility at such evalua-
tions, Appraisal makes it an exact science. 
System: The player adds the wraith’s 
dots in Usury to all dice pools for Death-
sight and Lifesight. This art is always active 
and doesn’t require touch.
• Gray Ledger (Initiate)

Each application of Usury leaves minute 
traces on its subject. A wraith skilled in this 
art can assess this history, learning the details 
of prior “transactions.”

System: The player rolls Charisma + 
Usury (difficulty 6). Each success is one 
prior Usury application, starting with the 
most  recent  and  working  backward,  in 
which the subject was either the user or 
the target. For each transaction, the wraith 
learns which art was used and when. If 
the subject was the target of a trans-
action, the Usurer also receives a 
brief vision of the Usury-user who 

was  involved.  In  addition,  the  wraith  learns  all  applications 
of Suspended Usury arts (see below) that are pending on the 
subject, regardless of when they were applied.

•• Pathos Conduit (Common)

A  Usurer  may  transfer  Pathos  between 
himself and another wraith, either voluntarily 
or not. This transferal is always clearly visible 
to onlookers, as a bright aura flares around 
the Pathos recipient during the process.
System:  To donate Pathos to a 
subject,  the  player  rolls  Charisma 
+ Usury (difficulty of the target’s 
current Pathos). To siphon Pathos 
from  a  subject,  the  player  rolls 
Manipulation + Usury (difficulty 
of  the  target’s  Willpower).  The 
Usurer may transfer up to 1 Pathos 
per success (though he doesn’t have to transfer 

the full amount).

Each  use  of  Pathos  Conduit  to  steal 
Pathos  from  an  involuntary  subject  gives 

the wraith 1 temporary Angst.

Any  failed  attempt  to  use  this  art  can 
result in disaster, as it reverses the desired flow 
of energy. If the intent is to give, a failure 
ensures the wraith instead takes, which can 
easily lead to Harrowings, or worse.
•• Plasm Exchange (Initiate)

Any  wraith  may  expend  Pathos  to 
heal lost Corpus levels (see “Healing,” p. 
295). A wraith who knows this art may do 
the opposite, sublimating his own Corpus 
into Pathos.

System: The player spends 1 Pathos to 
initiate the conversion, then rolls Charisma + 
Usury (difficulty 6). The wraith may convert 
up to 1 Corpus per success into Pathos (though 
he doesn’t have to convert the full amount).
••• Corpus Conduit (Common)

A progressive extension of Pathos Conduit, 
this art enables direct transfer of Corpus between 
the wraith and another being. As with the lesser 
art,  this  may  be  voluntary  or  involuntary,  and 
the  transfer  is  obvious  to  any  observer.  Corpus 
Conduit’s double-edged nature is well known, and 
a cause for concern among all who seek healing 
from unfamiliar Usurers.

System:  To  donate  Corpus  to  a  subject,  the 
player  rolls  Charisma  +  Usury  (difficulty  of  the 
target’s current Corpus or health levels). To receive 
Corpus, the player rolls Manipulation + Usury (dif-

TRAITS

217

ficulty of the target’s Willpower). The wraith may transfer up 
to 1 Corpus per success (though he doesn’t have to transfer the 
full amount), though he can’t receive Corpus or health levels 
that would put him over his own maximum Corpus.

When  a  living  being  is  involved  in  a  Corpus  Conduit 
transaction, health levels convert directly to Corpus on a one-
for-one basis and vice versa. Each use of this art to steal Corpus 
or health levels from an involuntary subject gives the Usurer 
2 temporary Angst.
••• Suspend (Initiate)

Used  as  promissory  note,  compulsion  of  obedience,  or 
judicial mechanism of parole, this art of Damocles allows the 
wraith to delay the effect of another Usury power.

System: When the wraith uses any other Usury art that 
targets another character, the player spends 2 additional Pathos 
and makes a resisted Charisma + Usury roll against the target’s 
Willpower. With success, the art used doesn’t take effect im-
mediately. Instead, it remains Suspended for a maximum time 
determined by successes rolled:
1 success 
2 successes  1 day
3 successes  1 week
4 successes  1 month
5+ successes  1 year per success

1 scene

The target of a Suspended art doesn’t automatically sense 
the Usury of Damocles hanging over her, though success with a 
Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 7) gives her the feeling 
that something’s amiss. With three or more successes, she knows 
the Usurer is that feeling’s source. In addition, a Suspended art 
is automatically evident to any wraith with Kismet (Fatalism •) 
and may reveal itself to other supernatural powers of perception 
at the Storyteller’s discretion.

At  any  time  before  the  Suspended  power  expires,  the 
wraith  may  spend  1  Willpower  to  “call  in  his  marker.”  The 
power takes effect at that moment, regardless of the distance 
between the wraith and his target. If the Suspended power is 
not called in before it expires, it dissipates with no effect. The 
Usurer has a constant intuitive sense of his Suspended arts and 
their remaining durations.

At any time, a wraith may hold a number of Suspended 
Arcanos applications equal to his Charisma. At Usury •••••, 
the wraith may Suspend the arts of other Arcanoi he knows.
•••• Facilitate (Common)

As a wraith’s command of life and death energies grows, he 
learns to serve as intermediary, channeling Pathos and Corpus 
from one being to another efficiently and without pause. To 
Facilitate such a transaction, he must touch both the donor 
and the recipient.

System: When the wraith uses Pathos Conduit, Corpus 
Conduit,  or  Arcanos  Conduit,  he  can  transfer  the  specified 

energy from one target to another, rather than between one 
target and himself. The player chooses which of the art’s two 
dice pools to use, accepting the associated difficulty, and suc-
cesses rolled apply to both ends of the transfer. If the wraith 
Facilitates the transfer of stolen Pathos or Corpus, both he and 
the recipient gain 1 temporary Angst.

A wraith using Corpus Conduit also may spend 1 Corpus 
to  use  Plasm  Exchange  mid-transfer,  converting  the  donor’s 
Corpus into Pathos for the recipient. This requires a separate 
roll for Plasm Exchange, using that art’s usual system (includ-
ing its Pathos cost).
•••• Oblivion’s Seal (Initiate)

In  legal  circles,  a  contract  is  termed  a  “meeting  of  the 
minds,” a common agreement on a set of circumstances and 
actions. This art is the Usury-user’s means of closing and enforc-
ing such agreements with the full weight of Oblivion behind 
them. A breach of an agreement made under Oblivion’s Seal 
brings immediate and crushing retribution upon the transgressor.
System:  To  initiate  this  art,  the  wraith  must  verbally 
state the terms of the agreement he intends to enforce, in the 
hearing of all other parties to be bound. The player spends any 
amount of Pathos and rolls Charisma + Usury (difficulty of 3 + 
the total number of characters to be bound). Each other bound 
party agrees to the terms and that player spends 1 Pathos. With 
success,  this  power  affects  all  targeted  characters  —  includ-
ing the wraith himself, if he is to be a bound party — for one 
year per success rolled. During this time, any character who 
breaches the agreement immediately suffers a number of dice 
of aggravated damage equal to the total amount of Pathos spent 
by all bound parties.

The initial application of this art ensures that each bound 
party understands the terms of the agreement exactly as the 
wraith intends them — in both letter and spirit. If Suspend 
is used with Oblivion’s Seal, the period of Suspension begins 
when a character breaches the agreement.

A BOTTLE IN FRONT OF ME…

For  the  purposes  of  Usury,  bottled  Pathos 
is  just  like  Pathos  in  a  wraith’s  pool,  but  the 
bottle (or other container) has limited ability 
to  resist.  A  container  with  no  special  proper-
ties is incapable of resisting any application of 
Usury to its contents. Consider an Artifact or 
relic  container  to  have  a  Willpower  equal  to 
its  Background  rating.  Further  treat  it  as  an 
involuntary subject unless the Usurer owns it 
(i.e., has paid the Background dots for it) or is 
in physical control of it.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

••••• Invest (Common)

The wraith can funnel his Pathos or Corpus into a relic, 
storing it for future use. He must focus on the relic in question, 
channeling  his  energy  and  carefully  sealing  it  away  with  a 
gesture or command phrase. Anyone who knows this key may 
then access the stored energies.

System: The player spends 2 Pathos and 1 Willpower to 
begin the transfer, then spends the amount of Pathos or Corpus 
he wants to Invest and rolls Manipulation + Usury (difficulty 7). 
Each success invests one point of Pathos or Corpus, up to the 
amount spent, into the relic. Any excess points are lost. Any 
relic may contain either Pathos or Corpus, but not both at once.
Among this art’s other applications, Invest is the means 
by which wraiths create soulfire crystals. All damage a Usurer 
takes from a soulfire crystal containing his own energy is lethal, 
not aggravated.
••••• Arcanos Conduit (Initiate)

Requiring  either  great  trust  or  great  desperation  to  use, 
this art allows the wraith to briefly loan or borrow mastery of 
an Arcanos. Usurers don’t like to admit it — such knowledge 
wins them no friends — but Arcanos Conduit doesn’t have to 
borrow Arcanoi from a willing subject. 

System:  The  player  designates  a  single  Arcanos  to  be 
transferred, spends 1 Willpower and up to 10 Pathos, and rolls 
Charisma  +  Usury  (difficulty  8).  The  Arcanos  transfer  lasts 
for one scene per success. The donor loses a number of dots in 
the specified Arcanos equal to half the Pathos spent, rounded 
down. The recipient’s rating in that Arcanos becomes equal 
to the number of dots transferred, regardless of how many dots 
he had before, and he can use all of the donor’s arts of an ap-
propriate rating.

If the Usurer uses Arcanos Conduit on an unwilling sub-
ject, the roll to activate this art becomes a resisted Charisma 
+ Usury roll (difficulty 6) against the target’s Willpower. The 
Usurer’s Shadow also gains 2 temporary Angst per Arcanos dot 
the Usurer steals.

If either wraith enters a Harrowing, Arcanos Conduit ends 
immediately and all stolen or borrowed Arcanoi return to their 
rightful owners. 

Example:  Pham  has  Argos  ••••,  including  Weather  Eye 
(Common •), Enshroud (Ancient •), Phantom Wings (Modern 
••), Flicker (Common •••), Turn the Anemoi’s Wrath (Initiate 
•••), and Tempest-Eiders Canceleer (Initiate ••••). Miranda 
has Argos • but only Weather Eye. Pham loans three dots of Argos 
to  Miranda.  While  the  loan  lasts,  Miranda  has  Argos  •••  and 
can use all of Pham’s one-, two-, and three-dot Argos arts. Pham’s 
Argos is reduced to • and he can use only his one-dot Argos arts 
until the loan expires.

TRAITS

219

he Shadow is the hidden half of a wraith, 
the version of her personality where the 
worst of her impulses and cruelty reside. 
No matter how vicious or kind she was 
in life, those dark aspects were present, 
a  part  of  who  she  was.  Once  she  died, 
however, those impulses and urges became 
something  else  —  something  powerful,  self-aware,  and 
dangerous. Every wraith has a Shadow, and every Shadow is 
simultaneously similar to others and yet terrifyingly unique. 
It is the dark secret every one of the Restless shares, and it is 
the enemy that each of them must ultimately face alone. And 
it is with the wraith, urging her to self-destruction, always. 
At its core, a Shadow is everything in us we were taught 
to hate and fear about ourselves, and it has a direct pipeline to 
a wraith’s attention because it lives inside his head. Dwelling 
in the wraith’s subconscious, it knows the wraith better than 
the wraith knows himself. It knows the weak spots, the secret 
shames and hidden sparks of resentment that can be fanned 
into flame, and it is neither shy or ashamed of putting this 
information to use. It is the refined product of each wraith’s 
inner darkness, given agency and a voice, and most terribly, 
a goal: Drag the wraith down to Oblivion.

The  Shadow  is  in  constant  communication  with  the 
Psyche, offering a stream of threats, comments, and bribes. 
It speaks directly to the wraith from inside her head. No one 
else can hear its whispered asides, its snide takedowns of the 

wraith’s friends or its attempts to goad the wraith into inap-
propriate responses. Occasionally the wraith will forget who’s 
talking to them and will respond out loud. Such moments 
are embarrassments. Everyone’s got a Shadow, after all, but 
nobody likes to talk about it. Being forcibly reminded of the 
Shadow’s presence makes everyone wary and uncomfortable.
Talking  isn’t  the  only  way  the  Shadow  gets  its  claws 
into the Psyche. It has powers, called Thorns, that enable 
it to warp reality to its wishes. It draws power from negative 
emotions that match its own Dark Passions. And it can offer 
“help” — loaning the wraith strength at key moments, but 
always with a potential cost. And woe betide the wraith who 
comes to rely on his Shadow’s goodwill, as there will inevitably 
come the moment when the expected assistance is withheld, 
and the wraith goes down under the weight of the betrayal.
Then again, as the scorpion said to the frog, it’s in the 

Shadow’s nature. 

To be clear, all Shadows may be on the side of Oblivion, 
but that doesn’t mean they’re solely about putting their wraith 
on the express train to annihilation. After all, that would 
be  too  easy.  Instead,  the  path  to  Oblivion  that  a  Shadow 
orchestrates  is  often  a  slow  one.  A  Shadow  relishes  every 
second  of  the  struggles  against  it,  building  carefully  upon 
every victory it achieves over the Psyche. If the fight is over 
too soon, the Shadow is denied the pleasures of that journey. 
Shadows are not desperate and suicidal. It is self-destructive, 
and  no  other  force  in  the  Shadowlands  hates  a  wraith  as 

Chapter 6:  The Shadowmuch as her Shadow does. The Shadow takes its time because 
it’s going to enjoy making her suffer. The fact that the evil the 
wraith does on her slow slide to Oblivion will help claim other 
souls? That’s the icing on the metaphysical cake.

The Shadow doesn’t always come across as purely adver-
sarial. It can fake the qualities the Psyche possesses, such as 
restraint, a moral conscience, and even mercy. In truth, it has 
none of these things. But a Shadow is playing a long game, and 
can fake the higher emotions as necessary in the service of his 
larger goals. It can offer good advice, provide actual assistance, 
and other benefits, tricking the Psyche into thinking it’s reformed 

THE SHADOW SPEAKS

Here’s the thing. The meat, it forgets. Brain 
cells died. Memories went away. You could always 
drink yourself into forgetting, or try drugs, or just 
bury  the  bad  stuff  you  did  where  it  will  never 
bother you again. And that works, for a while.

But it doesn’t go away for good. It just gets 
all  bundled  up  for  when  you  cross  over  to  the 
other side, and then it all comes back. All the bad 
thoughts and things you were ashamed of, all the 
lies and the cheats and the mean things you said 
about friends that you didn’t mean — or that you 
did. That’s what I am, and you can’t make me go 
away. You can’t outlive me. You can’t drown me 
in booze and drugs and therapy. You have to face 
me every day for the rest of eternity, because I’m 
not going anywhere. I’m going to remind you of 
all the crappy things you did, and I’m going to 
get you to do more of them, because you’re still 
you and you still have all those nasty little urges 
floating around. Only now I’m here to highlight 
the opportunities you have to indulge.

So go on. If you won’t say how stupid your 
friend looks in her new Moliate job, that’s OK, I’ll 
say it for you — and I’ll do it at the worst possible 
moment for you to bust up laughing. You’re going 
to be good and share those relics you found with 
your friends? I’ll be right there explaining why 
you deserve to keep the best stuff, and they never 
need to know about it. And then once you do, I’ll 
be along to remind you that you screwed them. 

You can’t run. You can’t shut me up. You can’t 
get away from me, because I’m you, and I’m just as 
much a part of you as all the noble bullcrap about 
saving your family and protecting your favorite 
teddy bear. Accept that, and maybe I won’t be 
able to end us the first chance I get. Accept that, 
and we’ll get along just fine.

or, even worse, wants to work together. It’s all just stratagem, 
though, a way to lull the wraith into relaxing her guard against 
the Shadow’s real agenda. In the end, the Shadow thinks it will 
get everything it wants, and this goal justifies any steps it takes 
along the way. If a wraith isn’t careful, the Shadow will — for 
the brief moment before the wraith is swallowed by Oblivion. 

Drawing Lines in the Mind

  Shadow  is  not  simply  a  wraith’s  “evil 
twin.” Shadows have, as previously noted, 
distinct  personalities  and  voices,  and  are 
undoubtedly self-aware. Some go as far as 
to name themselves, doing so to underscore 
their  differences  from  the  wraiths  whose 
subconscious  generated  them.  But  at  the 
same time, they are not distinct and separate; no matter how 
much a Shadow denies it, they are part of that wraith. And so, 
the Shadow has to judge the degradation it wishes to inflict 
on the wraith against its own tolerance for pain. On a certain 
level, the Shadow isn’t actively suicidal. It just wants to see the 
Psyche lose. At everything. Forever. 

Nothing a Shadow gives or offers, whether it’s advice or 
power, comes without a price. Wraiths can only do what they 
did  in  life  when  that  wicked  little  voice  comes  calling,  and 
struggle not to give in. No matter the promises or apologies a 
wraith gives after his Shadow lures him into havoc, odds are 
the damage of giving in will last for eternity. If a wraith accepts 
a single offer from his Shadow, that opens the door to the next, 
and the next, with the Shadow’s vise-like grip ultimately squeez-
ing out every hope and good intention. 

The  Shadow  knows  this,  and  as  a  result,  can  afford  to 
pick its battles. A Shadow who is constantly blathering in its 
Psyche’s ear is ultimately easier to tune out as white noise. A 
Shadow  who  waits  for  a  desperate  moment  and  then  offers 
something that seems to come with no strings attached is far 
more difficult to resist.

Beyond  its  role  as  tempter,  tormenter,  and  downfall,  a 
Shadow also orchestrates Harrowings. These desperate personal 
nightmares  are  crucibles  for  the  soul,  dragging  a  wounded 
wraith down into the Labyrinth itself to face his worst fears 
made  manifest.  There  are  only  a  few  ways  these  nightmare 
shadowplays end: the ultimate destruction of the wraith; the 
devastation and loss of one of his Passions or Fetters; or, if the 
wraith demonstrates sufficient courage and ingenuity, escape. 
But  even  those  who  emerge  from  a  Harrowing  theoretically 
unscathed bear the scars of what they have gone through, and 
what they hope to never face again. 

Faced with all this, the struggle against the Shadow may 
seem impossible. Only vigilance, will, and the occasional visit 
to a Pardoner to sap the Shadow’s supply of Angst can allow a 
wraith to hold the line. 

222

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

But  when  a  Shadow  grows  powerful,  it  is  not  restricted 
to speaking only to the Psyche that hosts it. It can reach out 
to the wraiths around it, even work with other Shadows, and 
seduce the companions a wraith loves most. If the Shadow grows 
powerful enough, watchful vigilance may be the only thing to 
stand between a wraith and Oblivion. 

Shadowplay

Roleplaying the Shadow is simultaneously a tremendous 
responsibility and incredibly liberating. On the one hand, having 
the opportunity to be the bad guy while in character, spitting an 
endless stream of insults and snarky observations, can be a lot of 
fun. On the other, making sure never to abuse the knowledge 
another player entrusted you with can be a thin line to walk.
At its core, Shadowguiding is about providing a counter-
point to another player’s character. It’s about offering alterna-
tives — not good alternatives, but alternatives — and giving 
voice to all the doubts and fears and frustrations that a wraith 
can have. It’s not about competition, or trying to take down 
another player’s character. It is about giving them more and 
better material to roleplay with by enabling them to riff off an 
enemy who knows them best: themselves.

In practical terms, Shadowguiding is a means of enriching the 
gameplay of your Wraith chronicle, adding a layer of adversarial 
intrigue and texture to the chronicle. That means, at the very 

least, talking to the Psyche on a semi-regular basis. What is said is 
entirely up to the Shadowguide. It can be threats, promises, offers, 
or even just running commentary. (And yes, Shadowguiding is a 
great way to get your otherwise-disruptive snark out productively.) 
What matters is that the Psyche isn’t allowed to go about its 
business securely. There’s always a reminder that someone else 
is watching, listening, judging, and most importantly, opposing. 
Comments from a Shadowguide to a Psyche can be spoken 
out loud for the entire group to hear, or they can be commu-
nicated via note or text privately. Unless circumstances spe-
cifically dictate it, the other wraiths in the Circle do not hear 
the Shadow’s voice. They do, however, hear any response the 
Psyche makes to the Shadow’s commentary, which can make 
things very clear when a wraith is having focus issues. 

The Shadowguide can also use the various powers at the 
Shadow’s disposal to influence events. Offers of Shadow Dice 
should always be made directly to the Psyche, with the negotia-
tion between the two playing out as long as necessary. Thorns, 
on the other hand, should be activated through direct commu-
nication with the Storyteller. Whether the Shadow then wants 
to take credit for whatever chaos follows is entirely up to the 
Shadowguide. Keeping the source of a sudden Spectre attack 
unknown  can  help  keep  a  wraith  off  balance.  On  the  other 
hand, gloating to the Psyche over what’s just happened while 
knowing the Psyche can’t tell anyone else has its benefits as well.

THE SHADOW

223

The third thing the Shadowguide does is guide Harrowings. 
As the adversary who knows the wraith best, the Shadowguide 
sets up — in conjunction with the Storyteller and other play-
ers as necessary — the parameters, scenario, and conditions 
of every Harrowing the wraith falls into. This doesn’t mean 
coming to each and every session with a massive flowchart of 
potential Harrowing scenarios, but it does mean that a Shad-
owguide should be ready to take point on a Harrowing should 
that unfortunate situation arise.

Finally,  the  Shadowguide  can,  at  appropriate  intervals, 
initiate  a  takeover  of  the  wraith’s  Corpus  through  a  process 
called Catharsis. This should be a rare and momentous occa-
sion, as it can have all sorts of implications for both character 
and chronicle. Even when a Shadowguide has the capability 
to  initiate  Catharsis,  that  doesn’t  mean  it  should  be  done 
immediately  or  automatically.  A  Shadowguide  should  treat 
the option to mount a short-term coup as a rare and golden 
opportunity, and not something to be gobbled up as soon as is 
humanly possible. For more on Catharsis, see p. 227.

Keeping It Separate

Making sure your character doesn’t know what the Shadow 
you’re playing does can be tricky. Putting together a cheat sheet 
of Shadow-only intel as a reference is a useful way to keep from 
crossing  that  metagaming  boundary.  Shadowguiding  should 
never replace playing your main character. Nor should it be 
used as a resource for that character’s adventures. What you 
learn as Shadowguide for one wraith should never be used to 
provide an unfair advantage for another.

Getting Started

Random selection of Shadowguides is the easiest and most 
straightforward method of assigning a Shadowguide to a char-
acter. At the beginning of the chronicle, the Storyteller simply 
drops every character’s name in a hat and lets each player draw. 
The  results  indicate  who’s  going  to  be  whispering  in  whose 
ear for the foreseeable future. Alternately, the Storyteller can, 
based on her knowledge of the players, their characters, and the 
upcoming storyline, assign Shadowguiding roles to each player. 
It is every Shadowguide’s responsibility to know the Shadow 
character they’ll be playing, and to be at least reasonably familiar 
with the Psyche that Shadow will be haunting. Taking the time 
to sit down and learn the Psyche’s Passions, Fetters, backstory, 
and basic capabilities is useful in effective Shadowguiding. So 
too is learning the character’s in-game history. This is especially 
important  for  someone  stepping  in  as  Shadowguide  for  an 
established character. Knowing who the player formed bonds 
with — or betrayed — can add depth to Shadowplay. The more 
specifics the Shadowguide has, the more specific she can be in 
her commentary and the more believable she is as the Shadow.
Players should always be prepared to accept changes in their 
Shadowy responsibilities. Taking on an additional Shadow if 
a player can’t make a session, being asked to switch Shadows 

with another player for storytelling or party harmony’s sake, 
or otherwise changing up for the benefit of the chronicle as 
a whole are all things every player should be prepared to do. 
As a result, it doesn’t pay to get too attached to one Shadow.

Finding the Shadow’s Voice

The basic tool at the Shadow’s disposal is simply her voice. 
A whisper in the ear at the right time — a doubt sowed, a snide 
comment that elicits a laugh at a bad moment, a hidden fear voiced 
just when the wraith needs to be strong — all of these have power. 
Engaging the Psyche in debate distracts her from the task at hand; 
insulting the Psyche’s friends or ideas can set off a geyser of rage that 

LISTENING TO THE SHADOW

While it may be tempting to deal with the 
temptations  of  the  Shadow  by  simply  ignoring 
them — and everything else the Shadow has to 
say — this approach is not recommended. For one 
thing, the struggle with the Shadow is an integral 
part of Wraith. Choosing to metagame one’s way 
around it is cutting yourself off from some of what 
makes Wraith unique and interesting. It’s also a 
great way to frustrate the unfortunate soul who 
gets  stuck  playing  your  Shadowguide.  Nobody 
wants their roleplaying efforts ignored, and to do 
so unconditionally from the get go diminishes the 
play experience for your Shadowguide as well.

On  the  other  hand,  engaging  with  your 
Shadow — even when you’re not forced to by 
Thorns  and  dice  rolls  —  can  be  a  lot  of  fun. 
There’s enjoyment to be had in verbally jousting, 
in agonizing over whether to take Shadow Dice, 
and getting talked into something against your 
better judgment because you know there has to 
be a catch, but you just can’t spot what it is. Mak-
ing those roleplaying choices can lead to great 
roleplaying opportunities and exciting moments, 
both for you and for the entire troupe. The risk of 
interacting with your Shadow can produce some 
remarkable rewards.

And then there’s the fact that a smart Shad-
owguide will notice that you’ve shut her out and 
take advantage of it — say, by offering good advice 
that you’ll resolutely ignore as you get sandbagged 
by  your  own  stubbornness  —  and  achieve  her 
ends anyway. 

Ultimately, the choice is yours. And yes, lis-
tening to your Shadow may not always be in your 
best interest as a character. But as a player, it makes 
for a richer, more interesting play experience. 

224

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

can be tapped for a Dark Passion. Even without Thorns, Shadow 
Dice, or Catharsis, the Shadow can do plenty of damage just by 
saying the things the Psyche doesn’t want to hear. 

That’s not to say an endless stream of negativity is the best 
way to go. Relentless chatter can wear a wraith down, but it can 
wear down players and Storytellers, too. Rather, waiting for the 
right moment — when the wraith needs to focus to succeed, 
when everything is riding on her — can make the Shadow’s 
words that much more effective. 

And not every line needs to be negative. A Shadow can play 
at being cheerful, supportive, and encouraging with the best of 
them. Cheering on a course of behavior that will lead to certain 
destruction is right in a clever Shadow’s wheelhouse. So is going 
full frenemy on a wraith’s Circlemates, carefully pointing out 
their flaws while pretending to compliment them. Hinting at 
unshared knowledge, lying, and even the occasional “Are you 
sure you want to do that? Okay, it’s your decision…” can go a 
long way toward getting the Psyche off-balance and vulnerable.
Deploying Thorns can be expensive, but unleashing them 
at the right time can have a massive effect. Using Trick of the 
Light just after an announcement that there’s a Doppelganger 
in the Citadel can make life very interesting for a wraith, and 
that’s just one example. Carpet-bombing with Thorns tends to 
reduce their effectiveness. Picking useful moments and then 
using Thorns to encourage other wraiths to do the real dirty 
work is much more most Shadows’ way.

Catharsis  is  when  the  Shadow  really  gets  a  chance  to 
shine, taking over the wraith’s Corpus and making it her own. 
While it’s tempting to reach for the dice as soon as Catharsis 
is a possibility, holding off until the right moment can be more 
powerful. Keeping the Psyche in suspense about how potent 
his Shadow is can be an excellent distraction. Waiting until a 
key moment, whether it be in the midst of battle or standing 
in a Deathlord’s throne room, to attempt a coup on the Psyche 
can make that moment of control really count. That’s not to 
say big moments are the only moments, as there’s much to be 
said for a quiet Catharsis spent sowing festering doubt between 
friends, but treating Catharsis as something to be used carefully 
can help make those scenes more enjoyable.

Certain Shadow archetypes, such as The Monster, have little 
use for subtlety and will charge ahead, throwing metaphorical 
bombs  with  both  hands.  But  even  the  crudest,  most  vicious 
Shadow looks for weak points rather than simply mindlessly 
raging. At the same time, not every Shadow needs to be a Pro-
fessor Moriarty, planning six moves ahead to harvest a single 
point of Angst a month down the line. The Shadow knows it 
has limited resources but all the time in the world, and so it 
can afford to pick its spots for greatest effect.

What the Shadow Wants

Shadows serve Oblivion. Shadows are not actively intent 
on self-destruction. Those two statements would seem to be 
mutually contradictory, but with Shadows, they work just fine. 

While every wraith’s Shadow is devoted to feeding the Psyche 
to the Void, that doesn’t doesn’t mean that the express lane 
is the Shadow’s only option. Rather, Shadows are interested 
in seeing the wraith fail – in watching and abetting the long, 
slow slide into darkness, and helping to do as much collateral 
damage as possible along the way. 

For the Shadowguide, that means coming up with strata-
gems besides kicking over every available rock to see if there’s 
a Spectre underneath. Merely acting out or attacking others 
will likely get the wraith soulforged, an altogether unsatisfac-
tory outcome from Oblivion’s point of view, and aggressively 
self-destructive behavior is going to limit the number of other 
wraiths willing to hang around. As such, focusing on small steps 
on the way to Oblivion rather than grand gestures can be a 
more enjoyable approach. Playing the Shadow as one note and 
bent only on self-destruction means missing a lot of the fun of 
Shadowguiding. Tricking the Psyche, setting traps for it, and 
watching its flailing responses cause more damage can be more 
satisfying, both to the player and to Oblivion itself.

Picking the Right Shadow

While some troupes prefer to assign Shadow roles randomly, 
others try to be more specific with the roles. Roleplaying should 
of course play into it — players should always be comfortable 
refusing a Shadow assignment they don’t think they’ll be able 
to do well, or that will make them or the player uncomfort-
able. Then there’s the question of logistics. One of the great 
advantages  of  Shadowguiding  is  that  it  potentially  keeps  all 
the  players  in  the  troupe  involved,  even  when  the  Circle 
splits up. Knowing which wraiths are likely to stick together 
and which ones are likely to split up can allow a Storyteller to 
assign Shadows based on those breakdowns. This in turn can 
make sure that players are always involved, even when their 
characters aren’t in the spotlight.

Beyond that, a good Shadowguide should have input into 
the creation of the Shadow she’s going to be playing, making 
sure its approach and tools are ones she can work with. That 
doesn’t mean taking over the process of Shadow creation, but it 
does mean investing where possible in the character to make it 
as enjoyable a roleplaying prospect as possible. And while players 
spend their characters’ Shadow experience, the Shadowguide 
probably has a few ideas as to where those points should go.

Confabs between player and Shadowguide can be a good 
thing as well. Having the two collaborate on character arcs can 
make for a richer experience for both players and the rest of 
the group. That doesn’t mean the Shadowguide has to tip his 
hand as to what he’s planning, but a good working relationship 
between the two can go a long way toward establishing the trust 
necessary for good Shadowguide gameplay. 

How Much to Say

There are two dangers in Shadowguiding: playing too much 
and playing too little. Getting wrapped up in one’s own character 

THE SHADOW

225

and completely ignoring Shadowguiding responsibilities weakens 
the game. Yes, it’s strategically a good thing for the wraiths to have 
one of their number not distracted, but it also dilutes the flavor 
of the chronicle and denies the other player the full experience. 
On the other hand, it can be very tempting to go overboard 
with Shadowguiding. The role of the Shadow is a great way to 
channel snark, and to have an in-game reason to unleash it can 
seem like a gift from above. However, the player who spends 
all  their  time  on  their  secondary,  Shadowy  responsibility  is 
neglecting his own character at the same time he’s applying 
too much pressure to someone else’s. This weakens the group 
by  damaging  two  characters,  and  can  lead  the  group  into  a 
cycle of escalating Shadow-driven retaliation that can drive 
the whole game off the rails.

Instead,  the  optimal  ratio  of  Shadowguiding  is  roughly 
20% of the time. Obviously, there will be moments when more 
or less is called for, but keeping it around one-fifth of the time 
ensures that nobody’s overwhelmed and nobody’s neglected. 
The Shadow should speak enough to make sure no one forgets 
he’s there, but not so much as to be omnipresent. Shadowguid-
ing is ultimately a supporting role, and as such should cede the 
spotlight appropriately. Players should always feel free to mention 
if they feel like the level of Shadowguiding is too enthusiastic 
(or too diffident), and Storytellers have a variety of narrative 
devices — from wandering Pardoners to voices echoing up from 
the Hive-Mind demanding silence — to enforce the point. 
Respecting Limits

By  nature,  the  Shadow  is  transgressive.  It  knows  the 
fears, pain, and weak spots of the character it grew out of, and 
it  ruthlessly  exploits  that  knowledge  to  drive  the  wraith  to 
Oblivion. If taken too literally, this can produce an unwanted 
adversarial relationship between player and Shadowguide. If 
taken too far, it can devolve from pushing a character’s buttons 
to pushing a player’s, and suddenly there’s more at stake than 
experience points.

Players and Storytellers should clearly delineate what’s off 
limits to the Shadowguide. Even if it putatively makes charac-
ter sense to go after a particular character trait, if it’s going to 
make the player uncomfortable, then the Shadow should leave 
that arrow in the quiver. Clear delineation between player and 
character is always important.

That being said, good Shadowplay can provide some of the 
most intense, moving roleplaying imaginable, especially if both 
player and Shadowguide are willing to go deep. If everyone’s 
willing and ready, there’s no reason not to explore serious and 
emotional material. 
Cooperation

It is possible for a Shadowguide to cooperate with a player 
in the face of a greater threat. The possibility of going to the 
forges, for example, can inspire an unlikely alliance. There are 
fates far, far worse than death in the Underworld, and even 
the most antagonistic Psyche and Shadow can see the benefit 

in setting aside their differences to avoid being trampled by a 
herd of Mourners. It’s what happens afterward that gets inter-
esting, however. 

Shadows don’t always have to be overtly confrontational. 
They are, after all, part of the same personality as the Psyche, 
and so they share deep knowledge of each other along with 
things like a sense of humor. And so, a Shadowguide can pep-
per her conversation with a player with asides for the wraith’s 
benefit and amusement, seemingly building a certain level of 
understanding, if not friendship. 

BEST DIRTY TRICKS FOR SHADOWGUIDES

Get the player hooked on Shadow Dice, then 

withhold them at a key moment.

Pretend to have heard interesting things from 
a fellow party member’s Shadow about what that 
wraith really thinks about the Psyche.

Draw the wraith into conversation while in a 
public space when they need to keep their cool. 
Nothing says “I don’t have this under control” 
like arguing with your Shadow in public.

Laugh  at  random  intervals,  and  when  the 

Psyche asks what’s up, saying, “Oh, you’ll see.”

Pass notes to the Storyteller. They don’t have 
to say anything. Better yet, pass notes that say 
“Please roll six dice and then nod while looking 
concerned.” Frantically and ostentatiously texting 
works, too. 

Carefully write down what other characters 
say about the Psyche so you can pull up out-of-
context quotes later.

Hum. It always makes the Psyche think you’re 

up to something.

Be ostentatiously afraid of a choice the Psyche 
is  considering  making.  Odds  are,  she’ll  notice 
and go for it. However it works out, claim that 
was your plan all along. Either way, you’re train-
ing the Psyche to make decisions based on your 
reactions and not the facts on the ground. And 
that can be very powerful.

Agree with every decision the Psyche makes 
over the course of a session. By the end of it, they’ll 
start second guessing themselves. After all, if you 
agree with what they’re doing, it can’t be right.

Repeatedly look up the rules for Thorns the 
Shadow doesn’t have. When asked why, answer 
“Oh, no reason.”

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Whether the Shadowguide then chooses to respect that 
frail understanding, or to use it as cover for a more devastating 
betrayal down the line, only the Shadowguide knows.
Blaming the Shadow

Every wraith knows that every other wraith has a Shadow. 
And this means every wraith knows there’s a good chance that 
when a wraith they know does something out of line, whether it 
be an outburst at exactly the wrong moment or the use of a Thorn 
that trips up the entire Circle, that the Shadow may very well 
be at fault. That can produce a certain level of understanding, 
but also a certain level of frustration as “we’ve all been there” 
wars with “get yourself under control.” And because the stakes 
can be so high and Shadow-tinged incidents are so unpredict-
able, that means that it’s very difficult — or very foolish — for 
a wraith to trust any other wraith completely. And that means 
that even those in the same Circle, bound by a shared Fetter, 
must always look slightly askance at one another. It’s simply 
the way the world of Wraith works.

Indeed, powerful wraiths are unlikely to accept “my Shadow 
did it!” as an acceptable excuse for losses of control or derelic-
tion of duty. The inability to control one’s own Shadow marks a 
wraith as potentially untrustworthy or weak, a potential asset for 
Oblivion, and those who hold the existences of many Restless 
in their hands are unlikely to have much sympathy for those 
who put their charges at risk.

This does not mean that every interaction between wraiths 
instantly becomes a Reservoir Dogs-style multi-character stand-
off, with everyone waiting for everyone else to make the first 
betrayal. Rather, it means that Wraith characters are always 
aware there are inimical forces in everyone’s head, and that to 
ignore that fact is suicidal. How each wraith then chooses to 
deal with that knowledge is up to him. Some may draw back 
from close relationships, while others may look for metaphysical 
sureties or study Castigation in order to help keep their friends’ 
Shadows at bay. But the knowledge is there, no matter which 
road a wraith chooses to follow.

Catharsis

Catharsis is the process by which the Shadow temporar-
ily takes control of a wraith’s Corpus, banishing the original 
personality to the Shadow’s usual place as an observer and, at 
best,  occasional  commentator.  Alternately,  the  Shadow  can 
choose to block the events of the Catharsis from the wraith’s 
Psyche, meaning that when she re-emerges in control, she will 
have no idea what damage her Shadow might have caused or 
what traps it might have laid while she was gone.

Unless a particular Thorn gives the game away, it is very 
difficult for an observer to tell when a wraith is in Catharsis. 
Behavioral clues are more likely to lead to discovery, as to all 
appearances  the  wraith  looks,  moves,  and  talks  like  herself. 
It’s just what she’s saying or doing that’s different — and not 
in a good way.

Note that while the Shadow is free to pursue its own ends 
during Catharsis, it rarely goes straight for self-destruction. The 
purpose of Catharsis is more to terrify the wraith and perhaps 
to teach a lesson about resisting the Shadow’s wishes, not a 
headfirst dive into the forges. However, a Shadow in Catharsis 
is free to sabotage relationships, commit acts that will get the 
Psyche in trouble, fail to honor the Psyche’s commitments, and 
start fights with angry Legionnaires. Particularly long-sighted 
Shadows will lay down booby traps that will only be triggered 
much  later,  when  the  line  connecting  it  to  that  moment  of 
Catharsis has been blurred by time. 

At the end of the scene, the wraith re-emerges and takes 
over her Corpus once again. Storytellers can choose how to 
end a Catharsis. In some cases, it might be as sudden as a snap 
of the fingers. In others, there might be an extended struggle 
for  control,  with  the  wraith’s  internal  monologue  becoming 
audible to wraiths in the vicinity. Or Shadow influence could 
simply fade, without a clear moment of demarcation.  For the 
rules of Catharsis, see p. 236.

Shadow Creation

nce  you’ve  established  your  character  on 
paper, there’s one more character sheet for 
you  to  work  on.  Part  and  parcel  of  every 
wraith is a Shadow, the dark mirror of the 
Psyche, and each is unable to exist without 
the other. Because the Shadow will be in 
conflict with the Psyche for as long as your 
character is able to resist it, it’s important to shape the Shadow 
to be something that has the capability to attract them as much 
as it repulses them. While Shadows can be distinctly different 
from the Psyches they’re part of, the most similar Shadow is 
also the hardest to deal with, an inner voice that sounds just 
like you. Shadows aren’t your evil twin. They’re you. 

Step One: Archetype

Just as the very being of a wraith is rooted in Archetypes, 
so is the Shadow. Archetypes are a way to express what your 
wraith  and  their  Shadow  are  like.  When  you  glance  down 
and read the archetype, it’s a reminder of exactly what kind 
of terrible creature your Shadow is. A character’s Prelude is a 
good time to garner clues as to the personality of her Shadow, 
as whatever negative traits she displays in real life will literally 
take on a life of their own in the Underworld. The following 
sample Archetypes are possibilities for your Shadow.

If none of these Archetypes fit your character, feel free to 

create new ones. 
Sample Archetypes

The  Delver  —  Nothing  is  as  simple  as  it  seems,  and 
nothing is worthwhile unless it involves some significant issue. 
This Shadow plumbs the depths of everything and anything, 

THE SHADOW

227

looking for a subtext even if one doesn’t exist. “What are you 
really thinking?” is her mantra; “Why did you really do that?” 
The Delver’s not satisfied with easy or obvious answers; she has 
to pick everything apart until she drives you, your friends, and 
everyone you encounter stark raving mad.

The Delver isn’t paranoid in the traditional sense; she may 
suspect conspiracies against you, but that’s not her real focus. 
No, she just wants to figure out what lies beyond the obvious 
answers, and she will not accept that some things are exactly 
what they appear to be. When she takes control, the Shadow 
asks painfully probing questions, dissects every answer, and comes 
back for more. By seeking a root cause behind every gesture, 
joke, or glance, she throws you into a downward spiral where 
everything demands a second guess…and a third, fourth, and 
fifth. Her relentless overanalyzing makes her Psyche (at best) 
continually trying to the patience of everyone around her, even 
as the Byzantine nature of Stygian politics means that once in 
a while, she just might be right.

The Abuser — Hurt terribly once, this impatient and jeal-
ous Shadow exists to inflict his pain on others. He scrutinizes 
the failures of everyone around him, heaping scorn upon them 
whenever he can. This is done partially to bolster his self-image, 
but primarily to make everyone else hurt just as much as he 
does. The Abuser will often goad you to attempt the impossible, 
just to watch you fail so that he can dine upon the self-loathing 
your failure engenders. 

Chaotic and crazed, the Abuser lashes out at any target 
other  than  his  favorite  one:  himself.  When  dominant,  the 
Abuser will spew his vitriol in all directions. Any excuse will 
set him off, and if no excuse is provided, he will create one. 
Demands for obedience, absurd requests, and systematic verbal 
or physical abuse are this Shadow’s hallmarks. After all, why 
should the rest of the world hurt less than he does?

The Director — Quiet and organized, the Director will 
take you apart with clockwork precision. Icy in her hatred, she 
will strip your defenses away layer by layer, taking pleasure in 
the surgical nature of the torment she inflicts. There’s nothing 
personal in what the Director does; she’s just setting the record 
straight by removing any delusions you might have about your 
goodness, sanity, or any other worthwhile qualities you might 
have  thought  you  had.  The  Director’s  usual  modus  operandi 
is to rifle through the back drawers of your mind, cataloging 
every weakness, every painful memory, and every personality 
flaw, no matter how minor. This ammunition isn’t randomly 
flung about, either, but hoarded for special occasions. Should 
your grasp on reality start to falter, the Director knows just how 
much pressure to apply to push you over the edge.

When in control, the Director likes to lay long-range plans 
for the next time she is dominant, and to prepare little revelations 
for you to discover at carefully timed intervals. She also enjoys 
picking apart your companions, making cutting observations 
that will poison any friendships you make on the other side. 
And the worst part is that she’s usually right.

The False Friend — Cheerful and personable, the False 
Friend doesn’t seem like an enemy. Sure, it’s fond of making 
nasty wisecracks about your associates when they’re around, 
and of course it puts down any course of action you think up 
with  a  vicious  bon  mot,  but  it’s  just  so  darn  much  fun  to  be 
around that you don’t mind. The fact that it’s slowly poisoning 
your relationship with everyone you know by filling you with 
contempt for them just slides on by. Your Shadow makes you 
feel cool, so what do you need those other losers for? And when 
it’s separated you from your friends, then the False Friend turns 
around and lets you know exactly what it thinks of you, how 
easily it fooled you, and how worthless and faithless you really are. 
Ultimately,  the  False  Friend  is  driven  to  tear  you  down 
with your own hypocrisy, driving you to mock the same flaws 
in others it will then turn around and point out in you. It’s al-
ways thinking about how to slide the knife in, making you feel 
superior one moment then leaving you unable to turn to anyone 
for help the next. It’ll get you to tear down everyone around 
you until they’re all gone, and the only one left to target is you.
The Parent — No one else can love you as much, or as 
well, as the Parent. No one else can take care of you as well, or 
make you as happy. The Parent even accepts all of your little 
imperfections, which she’ ll harp on endlessly in order to prove 
to you she loves you despite your nearly infinite flaws. She’ll 
protect you from people who don’t have your best interests at 
heart, and only she can decide who those are (usually, it’s every-
one else you know). You’re her darling baby, so naturally she’ll 
help you with the hard decisions, and even make them for you.
Mother  (or  Father)  knows  best,  even  if  you  break  her 
heart by never listening to her and running around with those 
Renegade hooligans….

When in command, the Parent will seek to insulate you 
from any corrupting or dangerous influences (i.e., anyone and 
anything else). To accomplish this, she will do and say anything 
to alienate those who care about you, using the fact that they 
could be driven off as proof that they weren’t really your friends 
in the first place. It just goes to show that she’s right, and that 
no one else can love you the way that she does.

The Martyr — Noble self-sacrifice has its place, but what 
the Martyr offers is a shallow mockery of it instead. By constantly 
demanding that you give of yourself because you can take the pain 
better than anyone else can, the Martyr cheapens your faith and 
indulges your arrogance. Claiming your sacrifice will bring about a 
greater good, the Martyr will then take pleasure in demonstrating 
that your pain didn’t do anything at all, and that your suffering 
was pointless…. Still, that won’t keep him from urging you to 
give up yourself for others every chance it gets. After all, it’s just 
looking for a good excuse to take the easy way out.

When the Martyr takes control, he will attempt to ma-
neuver you into situations where, no matter what, in order to 
escape you’ll have to give up something important. The Martyr 
also tries to arrange for witnesses whenever possible, so that its 
very public sacrifices can be used to shame others into similarly 
self-destructive acts.

228

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The Monster — Brutally direct, the Monster is all about 
pain and greed. Whatever it wants, it will command you to 
take.  Whatever  it  hates,  it  will  demand  that  you  destroy.  If 
you refuse, it will try to destroy you as well, for it cannot stand 
to be resisted in any way. There’s no compromise or subtlety 
in the Monster, and often it’s the most dignified and delicate 
wraiths who have a Monster lurking behind their eyes. To see 
the Monster dominant is to see a sneak peek of Spectrehood. 
It will lay waste to anything in its path, taking what it wants 
and destroying everything else out of sheer spite. Guttural and 
vulgar, the Monster rarely has anything to say that isn’t an ob-
scenity. Why bother being polite to anyone else when they’re 
nothing more than obstacles to your pleasure?

The Somnambulist — Life was a blur, unlife more so.
The Somnambulist sleepwalks through the afterlife, drip-
ping ennui. Nothing is worthy of her attention unless it’s directly 
in front of her, and then she won’t do anything to remove the 
obstacle.  The  Somnambulist  downplays  the  importance  of 
anything and everything, claiming that the details are always 
irrelevant. It wants the Psyche to slow down and not give it 
a migraine worrying about what that growing patch of black 
on the wall might mean down the road. For the moment, the 
splotch isn’t bothering anyone, and that’s all the Somnambulist 
cares about. 

When  in  command,  the  Somnambulist  withdraws  from 
any activities or commitments. She drops the ball, preferably 
in the most spectacular way possible (Yeah, I know we needed 
those swords forged but I just didn’t have the motivation. Oh, wait, 
are those Spectres?). On the surface a relatively mild Shadow 
to  have,  the  Somnambulist  enjoys  lulling  its  Psyche  into  a 
false  sense  of  security,  then  drawing  back  the  curtain  on  an 
unpleasant surprise.

The Perfectionist — Nothing you do will ever be good 
enough for the Perfectionist. Perform seven impossible things 
before breakfast, and he’ll be screaming at you for not having 
pulled off eight. Any imperfection can serve as a launching point 
for a tirade; any flaw will be a magnet for withering sarcasm. 
By playing up your inevitable errors, the Perfectionist inspires 
your self-hatred and saps your confidence in your own abilities. 
Then, once your confidence is shot, he’ll be more than happy 
to step in and show you how to do things right. If you had any 
sense at all, you’d turn things over to him permanently and 
make sure that everything got done properly the first time. It’s 
not like you’re capable of it, after all.

When  in  control,  the  Perfectionist  will  take  every  op-
portunity  to  criticize  whatever  or  whoever  catches  his  eye. 
He’ll also take the opportunity to embroil you in impossible 
scenarios, anxiously awaiting your inevitable failure. Still, at 

THE SHADOW

229

least he doesn’t play favorites. When everyone around him is 
equally flawed, one target’s as good as the next.

The Voice of Hope — You never really died. This is all a 
mistake. Once you figure out how to reverse this condition, you 
can return to your old life as if nothing happened. This whole 
thing is one long bad dream. You will wake up… you have to, 
sooner or later… right?

This cruel Shadow denies the reality that is your ghostly 
existence. He holds out a bright candle that sustains you through 
bad patches, but that becomes an unattainable torment as time 
wears on. How long could a nightmare possibly continue, any-
way? Doesn’t it ever end?

When he takes control, the Voice of Hope shuts out any 
possibility that the Underworld is anything other than an ex-
tended nightmare. If you ever manage to convince him that you 
are indeed condemned to this twilight existence, he shifts your 
concentration toward finding a “cure” for your Restless state. 
He’ll lead you to elder wraiths, living sages, magical spells, and 
spiritual quests, all of which will supposedly undo your death 
and restore you to the living world. 

Although he seems relatively cheery compared to say, the 
Monster, this Shadow inflicts endless pain by offering up hope, 
seeing it dashed, then repeating the process endlessly.

The Stormcrow — Always the bearer of bad news, the 
Stormcrow is convinced that there’s a land mine under every 
speed  bump.  She  is  certain  that  every  wraith  harbors  it  ill 
will, that every action is going to be disastrous, and that every 
corner houses a lurking Spectre. More to the point, she will 
detail these worries ad nauseam to the Psyche, reveling in every 
gruesome detail she can invent. As far as the Stormcrow is 
concerned, it’s not enough that a wraith’s actions be doomed 
to failure. The wraith has to fail spectacularly, and in such a 
way that the wraith gets the chance to regret the error for a 
very long time.

A  dominant  Stormcrow  does  her  best  to  dissuade  the 
wraith’s companions from any actions that might be beneficial 
to the Psyche. She dourly points out potential consequences 
and repercussions, all of which are bound to be catastrophic. 
She also puts effort into booby trapping all of the Psyche’s work, 
making certain that the dire fate she foresees will inevitably 
come to pass.

Step Two: Angst

Just as Pathos fuels a wraith, Angst powers her Shadow. A 
wraith’s Angst rating is indicative of the amount of negative 
emotional energy she is carrying around with her. Angst is the 
measure of a wraith’s fear, pain, and alienation, and the more of 
these counterproductive energies a wraith harbors, the higher 
her Angst score is. The higher the Angst score, of course, the 
more powerful the Shadow is, and the more fuel it has to use 
for its schemes. 

A wraith’s permanent Angst score always starts less than 
or equal to her permanent Willpower score. To determine a 

Shadow’s starting Angst, roll a number of dice equivalent to 
the  wraith’s  Willpower  against  difficulty  6.  The  number  of 
successes indicates the number of permanent Angst points the 
wraith starts play with. 

For purposes of this roll only, ones do not cancel out suc-
cesses, and every wraith must start play with at least one point 
of permanent Angst. Wraiths without permanent Angst have 
a shortcut on the road to Transcendence, potentially leading 
to a very short chronicle. Like Willpower, Angst can be spent 
(by the Shadow only) in order to achieve automatic successes. 
Unlike Willpower, however, temporary Angst can exceed its 
permanent rating, up to a maximum of 10. When a wraith’s 
temporary Angst exceeds her Willpower, the Shadow can at-
tempt to usurp control of the Corpus by means of a Catharsis 
roll (see p. 236). 

On the other hand, the Shadow can elect to keep stockpil-
ing temporary Angst. When temporary Angst reaches 10, the 
Shadow immediately trades it in for another point of permanent 
Angst. When permanent Angst reaches 10, the Shadow assumes 
command permanently, and the wraith becomes a Spectre.

Temporary Angst ratings tend to vary wildly during play. 
Shadows  use  Angst  to  power  their  special  abilities,  called 
Thorns, and can expend vast amounts of energy in their war 
against  the  Psyche.  On  the  other  hand,  a  great  many  Ar-
canoi give their wielders temporary Angst, and all Shadows 
have Dark Passions which can be fed as well. It is up to the 
Shadowguide to keep track of how much temporary Angst a 
wraith has, and to convert it to permanent form if necessary. 
It is also the Shadowguide’s responsibility to call for Catharsis 
rolls  when  appropriate.  A  wraith  should  never  know  quite 
how strong her Shadow is. After all, the uncertainty is part 
of what keeps life interesting.

Step Three: Dark Passions

Just as a wraith has Passions, her dark side has Dark Passions, 
and each wraith starts with 7 points’ worth. These function in 
roughly the same manner that Passions do, feeding the Shadow 
instead of the Psyche. Each Dark Passion should be phrased 
in the same way a Passion is, with a brief description of the 
Dark Passion and its core emotion following in parentheses. 
Each Dark Passion also has a rating to indicate how strong the 
obsession is. For example, a wraith who was a frustrated art-
ist in life might have the Dark Passion “Destroy works of art 
better than those I could have made (Envy) 3.” Dark Passions 
often reverse a wraith’s regular Passions, driving the Shadow 
to hurt what the Psyche wants to protect. On the other hand, 
some  Dark  Passions  can  be  parallel  to  normal  Passions,  and 
many have nothing to do with a wraith’s Passions at all. Dark 
Passions can be increased during the freebie-point section of 
Shadow creation.

Shadows can also possess Passions like “Dive into a Nihil 
(Self-Hatred)  2”  or  “Cause  random  destruction  (Rage)  3.” 
Emotions that serve as excellent cores to Dark Passions include 

230

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Envy, Lust, Twisted Love, Greed, Hate, and Fear. In the end, 
draw on the emotions that your character would suppress when 
they feel it, and actions they could take in response to that 
feeling — both the rational and the visceral. 

Step Four: Freebie Points

When the basics of Shadow creation are finished, there 
are  still  10  freebie  points  left  with  which  you  can  round 
out  your  Shadow’s  personality  and  abilities.  Freebies  can 
purchase additional Angst (permanent or temporary), new 
or stronger Dark Passions, or the special abilities Shadows 
have, called Thorns. A wraith’s permanent Angst score can 
never exceed her permanent Willpower score at the start of 
play, but temporary Angst can be bought up to nine points. 
Furthermore, while additional dots in Dark Passions can be 
purchased  with  freebies,  the  number  of  dots  in  Dark  Pas-
sions can never exceed the number of dots a wraith has in 
her regular Passions.
Thorns

Thorns are certain, unique powers the Shadow has at its 
disposal. These range from minor tricks to potent abilities that 
can threaten a wraith’s very existence, and their use is entirely 
up to the Shadowguide. The Shadow can also use Thorns (when 
applicable) during Catharsis.

Spectre Prestige: 1 point/level — Many Spectres have the 
ability to communicate with wraiths’ Shadows. Shadows with 
this  Thorn  have  garnered  the  respect  of  the  Shadow-Eaten, 
and will be treated accordingly.

Dark Allies: 1 point/level — A Shadow with Dark Allies 
regularly communicates and plots with Spectres, and can call 
on them for aid. This cannot be used to replicate Pact of Doom.
Tainted Relic: 1 point/level — This is a relic that only 
manifests during Catharsis, and the number of points indicates 
its  potency.  A  Tainted  Relic  will  always  manifest  when  the 
Shadow does, even if it has been “lost” or “destroyed.” A wraith’s 
Tainted Relic will always have some significance to him, even 
if he doesn’t admit it. A toy from an abusive relative he never 
mentions, or a shiv from time spent in prison that he’s somehow 
avoided ever talking about are the kind of Tainted Relics he 
may strenuously deny knowing anything about.

Infamy: 1 point/level — Memoriam for the Shadow, Infamy 
is the measure of how much fear and loathing the wraith still 
inspires in the living. Just as the wrath’s Psyche accumulates 
Pathos, Shadows can build up Angst. Every time a wraith with 
Infamy falls into Slumber, the Shadowguide rolls one die for 
each point of the Thorn possessed. The difficulty on this roll 
is 6, and each success gives the Shadow a point of temporary 
Angst. Botches remove temporary Angst, and just might cause 
the living to think more kindly of the wraith. No more than 
five points of Infamy can be taken, and an Infamous wraith had 
best be prepared to deal with the consequences of the hatred 
of the living.

Death’s Sigil: 1 to 3 points — Death’s Sigil is a promi-
nent sign of Oblivion’s touch on the character that manifests 
no matter where she goes. Each Sigil is unique; one wraith 
might have wings of choking smoke, another might leave 
footprints of seawater in the Skinlands, and a third could 
exude the odor of burned flesh. This Thorn naturally makes 
a wraith very distinctive, with all of the advantages and dis-
advantages this offers. Only by spending a Willpower point 
can a wraith turn off the effects of this Thorn for a scene. 
The more points put into the Thorn, the more pronounced 
its effect is. A one-point Sigil might not be that noticeable, 
while the three-point version could go so far as to alter the 
effects of the wraith’s Arcanoi. 

Shadow Traits: 2 points — The Shadow can purchase 
one dot of any Attribute or Ability, but these extra points 
are  only  available  during  Catharsis.  This  Thorn  can  be 
purchased  as  many  times  as  freebie  points  permit  during 
Shadow creation.

Nightmares: 2 points — When the Psyche Slumbers, 
a Shadow with this Thorn may cause her to have intense 
nightmares.  The  visions  this  Thorn  generates  are  so  hor-
rifying that the wraith must roll Willpower (difficulty 6) or 
immediately waken from Slumber, in the process losing all 
benefits accrued from Slumbering. Nightmares cost a point 
of Angst to inflict. A wraith can spend a point of Willpower 
before  Slumbering  to  ensure  that  she  is  immune  to  this 
Thorn;  only  the  Storyteller  should  be  informed  that  such 
an investment has been made.

Aura of Corruption: 2 points — Through this Thorn’s 
effects, the Shadow somehow defiles the wraith’s presentation 
of herself, making her presence unpleasant to other wraiths. 
The effect of Aura of Corruption is generally not grotesque; 
instead  it  is  subtly  disturbing.  Indeed,  it  may  have  no  overt 
impact, merely serving to make others uncomfortable. If light 
is somehow harder to come by near the wraith, or her teeth are 
subtly sharper, unease can quickly settle into the minds of her 
companions. If a wraith has Aura of Corruption, all difficulties 
on Social interaction rolls are raised by +2. This Thorn can be

Mirror, Mirror: 2 points — Related to the more power-
ful Trick of the Light, this Thorn alters a wraith’s appearance 
briefly. Whenever a wraith whose Shadow possesses this Thorn 
looks in a reflective surface, the Shadow has the option of ac-
tivating Mirror, Mirror. When the Thorn is used, the wraith’s 
appearance in a mirror or any other reflective surface (a pool 
of water is a great favorite) is horribly distorted in some way. 
The distortion usually plays up one of the Shadow’s Dark Pas-
sions, but the Shadow has a full palette from which to work 
when making his face monstrous. The distorted visage in the 
reflection is visible to all, not just the wraith himself, and it 
usually means that he’s got some explaining to do. There is no 
point cost to activate this Thorn, but as repeated use dims its 
effectiveness, wise Shadows save it for appropriate moments. 
One of the more popular uses of this Thorn involves altering 

THE SHADOW

231

a reflection when only the mirror, and not the wraith himself, 
can be seen by an observer.

Shadow Call: 2 points — Shadow Call allows a wraith’s 
Shadow to summon nearby Spectres. This Thorn can only be 
used when a wraith is in the Tempest or standing at the mouth 
of a Nihil, otherwise it has no effect. The Shadow Call is audible 
on the edge of a wraith’s consciousness as a thin, piercing shriek, 
and in time most wraiths will come to recognize its significance. 
To make a Shadow Call, the Shadowguide spends a temporary 
Angst point and rolls against his permanent Angst score (dif-
ficulty 7). The number of successes indicates the number of 
Spectres summoned, however, the type of Spectre that answers 
the Shadow Call is entirely up to the Storyteller.

Pact of Doom: 3 points — This Thorn is the apocryphal 
deal with the devil. If a wraith has this Thorn, she and her 
Shadow can negotiate a pact by means of which the Shadow 
will teach her a predetermined number of levels in an Arcanos. 
In exchange, the Shadow acquires permanent Angst equivalent 
to the number of levels taught. The terms of the Pact must be 
agreed upon by both Psyche and Shadow, as the arrangement 
is entirely consensual.

The knowledge that the Shadow imparts under this Thorn 
comes from the vast Spectral hive mind, and does not reflect 
the knowledge of the Shadow itself. Only Shadows with Pact of 

Doom can access this knowledge, and only when empowered by 
a Pact. At no other time can a Shadow call to the hive mind for 
this sort of knowledge or power. This cannot be replicated using 
Dark Allies. Dark Allies centers on the Shadow’s relationship 
with Spectres and their willingness to aid it.

Trick of the Light: 3 points — By using this Thorn, the 
Shadow subtly alters the Psyche’s perception of the scene. When 
the Thorn is invoked (at a cost of one temporary Angst per 
scene), the Shadowguide should inform the Storyteller what 
exactly the wraith perceives. The Storyteller then relays this to 
the player. Trick of the Light is not limited to sight, and any of 
the other senses can be affected by its use. However, only one 
sense can be affected per scene. This Thorn only affects the 
Shadow’s Psyche, and not any other wraith.

Bad Luck: 3 points — For each Angst point a Shadow 
with Bad Luck spends, the wraith’s player is forced to reroll one 
die (Shadowguide’s choice). The use of Bad Luck does not have 
to be announced until after the original roll is made.

Shadowed Face: 3 points — With this Thorn, the Shadow 
completely changes its Psyche’s appearance when it takes over. 
Shadowed Face allows the Shadow to have one other visage 
(not a variety), which can be either known or unknown to the 
wraith’s associates. For an additional freebie point, the Shadow 

232

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

can have the option of assuming the Shadowed Face or retaining 
the wraith’s original appearance during Catharsis.

Honeyed  Tongue:  4  points  —  The  Shadow  is  almost 
preternaturally persuasive, and it can really turn on the charm 
when it chooses to do so. By spending a point of Angst, and 
rolling temporary Angst (difficulty is the target’s Manipulation 
+ Subterfuge), the Shadow can make any one sentence strangely 
compelling — and believable. This covers everything from I’m 
sure Lucien won’t mind if you steal his relic beer to The Shade won’t 
bite if you just lean over and pet it nicely.

A wraith can spend a Willpower point to counteract the 
effects of this Thorn. Honeyed Tongue can be used only once 
per scene.

Tainted Touch: 4 points — This Thorn makes a wraith 
something of a Typhoid Mary among the Restless. When af-
flicted  with  Tainted  Touch,  a  wraith  spreads  Oblivion  with 
the brush of a finger. Whenever a wraith with Tainted Touch 
comes in contact with another wraith’s Corpus, he must roll 
three dice (difficulty 6). The number of successes equals the 
number of temporary Angst points that the victim suddenly 
acquires. However, if aware of the touch the victim can make 
a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) to resist, and every success on 
this roll cancels one of the offender’s successes. A wraith with 
Tainted Touch can spend a Willpower point to turn the effect 
off for a scene. This Thorn can only affect a wraith once per day.
Shadowplay:  5  points  —  Shadowplay  allows  a  wraith 
who has used up all of her actions during a turn to get another 
one, but at a cost. If the Shadow offers, the wraith can take an 
additional action, but she loses a point of Pathos and gains a 
point of Angst. The wraith cannot ask for the additional action; 
the decision as to whether or not it’s available is entirely up to 
the Shadowguide. While the cost of activating this Thorn is 
deceptively low, a wraith who comes to rely upon it can feed 
her Shadow’s strength very quickly, and also can find herself in 
dire straits when the extra action she was counting on suddenly 
isn’t forthcoming in a crisis.

Shadow Familiar: 5 points — While the Shadow stays 
within a wraith’s consciousness, a Shadow Familiar can serve as 
its eyes, ears, and feet. Most Shadow Familiars take the form of 
ravens, rats, or other creatures of the carrion heap. The Shadows 
of other wraiths distract them from seeing the creature whenever 
possible. The Shadow Familiar is a minor servant of Oblivion 
and remains in constant contact with the Shadow, feeding it 
information and suggestions. Shadow Familiars can come in 
any form, but all are both small and harmless. If threatened, a 
Shadow Familiar will run away; if attacked, it will dive into the 
Tempest. If a wraith’s Shadow Familiar is destroyed, another 
one will arrive within a week to take its place. However, this 
one will be considerably more circumspect in its dealings with 
the Shadow, as even creatures of Oblivion have a faint sense 
of self-preservation. 

Freudian Slip: 5 points — At the cost of one Angst point, 
the Shadow can force a wraith to make a sudden, involuntary 
action or make a quick, unedited statement. Freudian Slip can 

also be used to put an unbidden thought into a wraith’s mind. 
To resist this Thorn, the wraith must make a Willpower roll 
(difficulty 7). Two successes are necessary to counter the effects 
of Freudian Slip. This can be a hard Thorn to use, both to make 
up an appropriate action or statement, as well as to roleplay 
it. Shadow players should scheme with the other player when 
apt to craft a particularly effective use of Freudian Slip. This 
Thorn is powerful, and players it’s used on should be able to 
handle the occasion maturely.

Shadow Life: 5 points — Whenever a wraith with this 
Thorn Slumbers, her Shadow takes control of their shared Corpus 
and sets out to do its worst. This will lead to no end of trouble 
for the Psyche, as she will constantly find herself encountering 
situations her Shadow has created and people whom her Shadow 
has wronged. Of course, all of the blame for the Shadow’s ac-
tions will land squarely on the Psyche. Wraiths with this Thorn 
are aware that their Shadows do get up and walk around, but 
have no way of knowing what precisely their dark halves do. 
If characters wish, they can invest an additional freebie point 
in this Thorn and have their characters be unaware of their 
Shadow Life. The player, not the Shadowguide, controls the 
character while Shadow Life is active.

Whispers:  6  points — A Shadow with this Thorn can 
speak to the Shadows of other wraiths without the knowledge 
of their Psyches. This allows the Shadows to work together, 
sharing  information  and  stratagems.  A  wraith  can  make  a 
Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 8) to determine if her 
Shadow seems somehow distracted, but otherwise there is no 
way for her to pick up on the fact that her other half is talking 
to someone else.

Manifestation: 6 points — By expending four points of 
Angst, the Shadow can materialize as an entity separate from 
the wraith. While in this state, the Shadow can converse, af-
fect objects, and use Thorns. The manifested Shadow is in all 
ways physically identical to the wraith from which it came, and 
bystanders may have a great deal of difficulty telling the two 
apart. Even the auras of the two Corpora are the same. On the 
other hand, a Legionnaire coming across two identical wraiths 
may well shout “Doppelganger!” and charge in, sword in hand. 
A Manifestation lasts for a single scene and, after manifesting, 
the Shadow must rest silently for the next scene.

Devil’s Dare: 7 points — Devil’s Dare is the emotional 
equivalent of a game of chicken. To use this Thorn, the Shad-
owguide invests a number of temporary Angst points (marked 
off immediately) and writes down something that she dares the 
Psyche to do before the end of the session. The difficulty of the 
dare determines the cost, and if a player feels that the number 
is excessive, she can petition her Storyteller to have it lowered.
The dare itself consists of an action that the Shadow is 
daring the Psyche to take. It must be within the wraith’s ca-
pabilities to perform; (i.e., “Tell the Centurion off to his face” 
would be acceptable while “Map the Labyrinth” would not) 
and an impossible dare simply loses the invested Angst. If, by 
the end of the session, the dared Psyche has not managed to 

THE SHADOW

233

work the dare into her actions, she loses a number of temporary 
Willpower points equal to the number of Angst points invested 
in the dare. If the Psyche succeeds, the Shadow gains temporary 
Angst equal to half the Angst used on the dare.

Vampiric Nature: 7 points — Related to the Dark Arcanos 
Larceny, this Thorn enables a Shadow to siphon Angst from 
others for its own purposes. Upon physical contact, a Shadow 
with Vampiric Nature can roll the Psyche’s contested Willpower 
against  any  wraith  or  Spectre.  The  number  of  successes  the 
Shadow achieves on the roll indicates the number of Angst 
points  that  it  can  absorb.  The  Shadow  does  not  need  to  be 
dominant for this Thorn to operate, and it can gain Angst quite 
merrily with the Psyche never suspecting a thing. Should the 
Shadow’s target be willing to donate some Angst, the Shadow 
can accept up to five points of temporary Angst at a time. This 
can be used once per target per session. 

Example of Shadow Creation

nnys,  Joshua,  and  David  have  made  it 
through most of character creation and are 
now settling in to create a Shadow together. 
The Shadow Archetype that immediately 
leaps out at Annys for her character Robin 
is the Perfectionist. This Shadow is Robin’s 
Critic  Nature  with  no  restraint  and  no 
qualms; the same intelligence that searches out hidden flaws 
can also relentlessly exploit buried fears.

To establish Robin’s Angst rating, Joshua rolls seven dice 
(equal to Robin’s Willpower). Against the difficulty of 6, he 
comes up with five successes; the Shadow will start out with 
five permanent Angst points. Next, Annys talks about poten-
tial Dark Passions with David, who’s going to control Robin’s 
Shadow. Robin’s most obvious weakness is his paranoia about 
his series of affairs with students. Therefore, Annys and David 
conclude that the Shadow will do its best not only to get Robin’s 
secret out in the open (while constantly assuring him that of 
course he can and must keep it hidden), but also to reinforce 
his sense of remorse over his repeated losses of control. Joshua 
distills  that  into  “Ruin  Robin’s  reputation  among  the  living 
(Self-Loathing),” and assigns it a rating of 3. 

David then suggests that whereas Robin wanted to demon-
strate his superiority to his fellow scholars, the Shadow would 
rather reach out to destroy all rivals. This produces a Dark Passion 
of “Hurt professional rivals (Hate),” with a rating of 2. After a 
little more joint brainstorming, Annys puts the last two points 
into “Ruin Robin’s protégé’s career (Jealousy).” After all, to the 
Shadow’s way of thinking, it’s not fair she lived while Robin died.
With the 10 freebie points allotted for the Shadow’s Traits, 
Annys first purchases Pact of Doom. Robin’s eagerness to expand 
his areas of knowledge makes him particularly vulnerable to 
this Thorn. She spends three more points on the Trick of the 

Light  Thorn,  knowing  how  heavily  Robin  relies  on  reading 
others’ body language and what that says about their intentions. 
David then encourages her to put two points into a Dark Pas-
sion opposing Robin’s desire to safeguard his beloved copy of 
The Canterbury Tales. Annys does this, deciding on the Dark 
Passion “Destroy Robin’s favorite book (Spite)” 2. With the 
two points she has left, Annys gives the Shadow one dot of 
Temporary Angst. Robin’s Shadow is now effectively complete. 
Annys, David, and Joshua then continue to discuss both the 
character and the Shadow until all three of them are sure that 
they understand the interaction of Robin’s two personae and 
are comfortable with the roles each of them will play. Among 
mature players, the Shadowguide and the player who controls 
the Psyche should be able to exchange information about the 
Psyche freely. David being able to look over Robin’s sheet gives 
him information out of character that will let him better tailor 
how the Shadow acts toward Robin. 

Angst

ngst  embodies  the  inner  torment  of 
unfulfilled  passions,  self-doubt,  guilt,  and 
unfinished business — all the things that 
result in the formation of a wraith. It is the 
nightmare that hovers on the edge of dreams, 
the devouring worm of defeat that eats away 
at hopes and desires, the unimaginable doom 
that lurks just around the corner. In short, Angst is the mind’s 
own bogeyman, always ready to spoil the party. It is the negative 
energy that drives a soul toward self-destruction. And the Shadow 
needs it to power its ambitions. Without Angst, the Shadow is 
just a voice crying out. With Angst to draw upon, it can act.  

In the Beginning

A wraith’s initial Angst rating is determined during the 
generation of her Shadow. This score represents the number 
of permanent points of Angst a new wraith possesses, and also 
indicates the relative strength of the character’s Shadow. Dur-
ing the course of play, a character’s Angst rating may increase 
or decrease in response to the events of a story and the actions 
of the character (or her Shadow).

There are two kinds of Angst: temporary and permanent. 
Unlike most Traits, a Shadow’s temporary Angst score may exceed 
its permanent rating, up to a maximum of 10 points. When a 
Shadow has accumulated 10 points of temporary Angst, it may 
trade these points for one point of permanent Angst, thus increas-
ing its own strength. The character’s main player should never 
know for certain how many points of Angst her Shadow possesses. 
This reflects the uncertainty of a wraith’s tenuous existence 
on the borders of Oblivion and her ignorance of just how pow-
erful her dark side really is.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The Pitfalls of the Harried Soul

Angst symbolizes the power of Oblivion working within 
a wraith. The more Angst a character possesses, the stronger 
her Shadow grows and the easier it becomes for the Shadow to 
assume control of her actions. Since the Shadow’s ultimate goal 
is nothing less than the destruction of the pesky Psyche which 
prevents it from fulfilling its darkest desires, it will attempt to 
place the Psyche in situations that offer high Angst potential. 
Because a Shadow uses Angst to power its activities, the more 
times it can force the Psyche to compromise itself, the more 
Angst the Shadow garners and the easier it is for the Shadow 
to work its will.

Acquiring Angst

The continual torment of life in the Shadowlands makes 
acquiring Angst inevitable, and opportunities for doing so are 
numerous. The natural condition of a wraith character’s exis-
tence embodies internal conflict, and it is this inner war that 
results in the consistent accumulation of Angst. A wraith may 
gain Angst in one of several ways. Unless otherwise specified, 
all Angst gained is temporary Angst, which remains until spent 
or until converted into permanent Angst points.

• Arcanoi: The use of certain Arcanoi by a Psyche-con-
trolled character automatically results in the accumulation of 
either temporary or permanent Angst (see Chapter Five). For 
example, a wraith who uses Castigate • (Playing With Fire) 
to acquire additional dice from her Shadow gains a point of 
temporary Angst each time she uses this Arcanos. Likewise, 
a wraith who uses Puppetry ••••• (Obliterate the Soul) to 
permanently possess a living human runs the risk of drastically 
increasing her Angst rating due to the exploitative and inhu-
mane nature of the action.

Note: If the Shadow dominates a character when these 
Arcanoi are used, however, the Angst that would normally be 
gained is, instead, deducted from the Shadow’s current Angst 
rating.

• Shadow Dice: In critical situations, a wraith’s Shadow 
can  offer  her  Psyche  extra  dice  to  increase  the  chances  of 
successfully  accomplishing  some  action.  Each  one  rolled  on 
those Shadow Dice results in the acquisition of one point of 
temporary Angst. The Shadow can offer up to five extra dice to 
any single roll. This is the most likely to be accepted when it’s 
life or death for the Psyche and Shadow — matters of survival, 
saving a Fetter, or other times when the need for an edge will 
make the Psyche more willing to deal. Canny Shadowguides 
will use Shadow Dice wisely, picking emotional moments and 
exploiting  the  Psyche’s  desire  for  the  best  possible  results  of 
her actions. Even if they don’t lead to more temporary Angst, 
Shadow Dice moments can be used to build the illusion of a 
positive emotional connection between the Shadow and Psyche. 
Particularly clever Shadows will build a dependence on those 
extra dice in their Psyches, then withhold them at key moments 
unless certain concessions are made….

• Dark Passions: When the Shadow indulges its own 
Passions, a character’s Angst score may increase. When the 
wraith indulges in an emotion that matches the core of a Dark 
Passion, the Shadowguide can roll against that Dark Passion 
(difficulty 7). Every success results in the addition of one point 
of temporary Angst. For example, if Morgan’s Shadow has the 
Dark  Passion  “Acquire  as  many  relics  as  possible  (Greed)” 
and Morgan looks a little too enviously at his friend Sascha’s 
relic knife, Morgan’s Shadowguide would be free to make a 
Dark Passion roll. Note that in this case, however, Morgan 
is  acting  greedily  of  his  own  volition,  and  not  because  the 
Shadow forced him to. The Shadow may also attempt to evoke 
in someone else an emotion that powers one of its own Dark 
Passions (difficulty 9), gaining one point of temporary Angst 
per  success.  If  Morgan’s  Shadow  pestered  him  into  ogling 
Sascha’s knife against his better judgment, then this sort of 
Dark Passion roll could be made instead.

• Storyteller Discretion: The Angst rating of a character 
should also reflect the ongoing struggle to deal with the external 
and internal torment of wraithly existence in ways that are not 
as clearly defined by a system of rules. Roleplaying scenes in 
which a character confronts doubts, fears, or external dangers 
may  warrant  “awarding”  a  point  of  temporary  Angst  to  the 
character by the Storyteller. The player must agree that such 
an increase in Angst is appropriate to the situation, since such a 
decision is not determined by the result of a roll but is, instead, 
achieved through mutual consent.
Losing Angst

Gaining Angst is easy; losing it is hard, but not impossible. 
There are a number of ways in which a Shadow can lose Angst 
(usually at the instigation of the Psyche):

• Botching a roll when the Shadow is dominant: Shadows 
hate failure. A botch on any roll made by a Shadow-dominated 
character results in the loss of one point of temporary Angst 
per one rolled above the number of successes.

•  Castigation:  Largely  the  exclusive  province  of  the 
Pardoners’  Guild,  this  Arcanos  is  specifically  geared  toward 
the  reduction  of  Angst.  Unless  a  wraith  possesses  Castigate 
•••••  (Defiance),  however,  she  may  not  use  this  Arcanos 
on herself, but must seek out another character to perform the 
appropriate rituals or actions necessary to rid her Shadow of 
some of its Angst.

Even  in  the  Shadowlands,  confession  really  is  good  for 

the soul.

•  Shadow-dominated  use  of  certain  Arcanoi:  Some 
Arcanoi  automatically  increase  a  character’s  Angst.  Use  of 
the Arcanoi when the Shadow is dominant, however, causes 
the amount of Angst that would normally he gained to be lost 
instead. Similarly, when a Shadow-dominated character fails 
or botches a roll involving any Arcanoi, Angst is lost rather 
than gained.

THE SHADOW

235

Note:  Losing  Angst  in  this  fashion  should  never  be  in-
tentional. It is up to the Storyteller to monitor carefully those 
situations  in  which  a  Shadow-controlled  character  seeks  to 
use  an  Arcanos  in  order  to  make  certain  that  the  action  is 
not primarily directed toward the possible reduction of Angst. 
• Storyteller Discretion: When a character is making a 
serious effort to rid herself of unwanted Angst, the Storyteller 
may decide to reduce the character’s temporary or permanent 
Angst rating as a reward for good roleplaying. This kind of bonus 
should be used sparingly, so as not to devalue the difficulty of 
losing Angst. As usual in situations that do not involve dice 
rolls, this should be a mutual agreement between player and 
Storyteller.
Harrowing and Angst

A  wraith  who  survives  a  Destruction  Harrowing  may 
receive a reduction in temporary Angst as a reward for good 
roleplaying or clever handling of her situation. This reflects 
the  increased  confidence  and  sense  of  relief  experienced  by 
emerging  victorious  from  a  situation  which  threatens  the 
character’s very existence. Because a wraith rarely goes looking 
for an opportunity to experience a Harrowing, it should not be 
considered as a natural way to lose Angst. 

The  following  actions  may  lead  to  the  accumulation  of 
Angst by a wraith character. In some cases, performing certain 
activities automatically results in increasing a wraith’s temporary 
or permanent Angst. In others, a roll determines whether or 
not Angst is gained.

Being  forced  into  an  action  that  contradicts  a  personal 

code of morality or honor.

or external helplessness.

Experiencing a situation that arouses a state of inner turmoil 

Failure to succeed in accomplishing a vital task.
Inaction due to indecision at a critical moment.
Involuntary destruction of a Fetter.
Loss of a Passion through neglect.
Making a decision that later proves to be disastrous.
Using Arcanoi that cause an increase in Angst. 

The Catharsis Roll

In order for the Shadow to take control of a character, the 
Shadow and the Psyche face off against one another. The Shadow 
spends a point of temporary Angst and rolls on her adjusted 
temporary Angst rating. The Psyche may resist by rolling her 
permanent Willpower, plus any Eidolon dice she may possess 
(see “Eidolon,” p. 143). The difficulty for both rolls is 6, and the 
side with the higher number of successes gains (or, in the case 
of the Psyche, retains) control of the character. If the Shadow 
succeeds in seizing control, it dominates the wraith’s actions 
for the entire scene following the takeover attempt. Afterward, 
control of the wraith reverts to the Psyche. 

While the Shadow is dominant, it may pursue any of its 
own ends without interference from its Psyche. The Shadow 

may seek to fulfill its Dark Passions, making use of its Psyche’s 
Arcanoi  in  addition  to  its  own  Thorns.  Its  actions  will  not 
result in gaining Pathos for its Psyche, although it must use 
the Psyche’s Pathos to power any Arcanoi it uses. Any art that 
normally would cause the wraith to gain Angst instead subtracts 
it during Catharsis, and the same goes if the result is a failure or 
a botch. Furthermore, the Shadow cannot expend Willpower, 
nor may it reduce the character’s Pathos below l. 

When the Shadow is in control, it may attempt to keep its 
actions secret from the Psyche. A wraith can only attempt to 
resist this effect by rolling her Eidolon dice against difficulty 7, 
assuming that she has any. Wraiths who do not possess Eidolon 
or who have used up their Eidolon dice for a session do not get 
to make any sort of resistance roll, and they (along with any 
wraiths who fail their Eidolon roll) will often find themselves 
haunted later by the actions taken by their Shadows during 
Catharsis. More than just a simple joyride, Shadows put their 
time during Catharsis to terrifying use. Engaging in any action 
necessary to damage the wraith’s reputation, interfering with 
the Fetters of its Psyche — or even other wraiths — as well 
as imperiling their contacts and pissing off Legionnaires. It is 
well within the realm of possibility that a Psyche can return to 
control and never know what its Shadow put in motion until 
it’s too late.

Alternate Rules

The rules of Shadowguiding as they are written might not 
work for your game. That’s fine; if you need to try a different 
approach, alternatives to the traditional Shadowguiding rules 
do exist. Whether you go with a single solution or mix them, 
you always go with the choice that your players are the most 
comfortable with, and excited by. Choosing an alternate method 
to portray Shadows doesn’t lock the troupe into that approach 

SHADOWGUIDES AND CATHARSIS
Some troupes may want to keep the Shad-
owguide  of  a  character  undergoing  Catharsis 
involved in the action, even after the Shadow 
has assumed control. In this instance, it is sug-
gested that while a character’s regular player is 
portraying the Shadow, the Shadowguide take the 
part of the subdued Psyche and offer that part of 
the character’s perspective on events. A Psyche 
involved  in  this  manner  cannot  offer  “Psyche 
Dice,” nor can it do anything but advise. However, 
this does allow the Shadowguide to remain a part 
of the action. Plus, the experience of playing the 
Psyche, even under such difficult circumstances, 
will aid in the Shadowguide’s understanding of 
the character she is trying to subvert. This is by 
no means a mandatory rule, and is recommended 
only for advanced Wraith troupes. 

236

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

forever. It’s simply picking the best way to use them in your 
game right now, and as your players progress, the way they want 
to deal with Shadows may change as well. 

• Dedicated Shadowguide
Troupes  can  elect  to  have  a  player  that’s  a  dedicated 
Shadowguide,  playing  the  Shadows  of  all  player  characters 
and forgoing having their own character. In this situation, the 
Shadowguide should be someone who can work well with the 
Storyteller.  A  dedicated  Shadowguide  gives  the  Storyteller 
someone they can collude with regularly in order to consistently 
tie Shadows deeply into the characters’ existence, as well as the 
troupe’s larger narrative at hand. For this kind of Shadowguide 
to  work,  they’ll  need  to  be  as  informed  as  the  Storyteller  is 
about character backgrounds, to best portray the Shadow of 
each character. 

Since there’s only one Shadowguide at work, Storytellers 
may want to plan with the Shadowguide on doing “spotlight” 
sessions when appropriate, giving an intense Shadow experi-
ence to a player, but keeping a light hand with them outside 
those spotlights. This gives a player a few sessions to recover 
from that fierce one on one with the Shadowguide, and allows 
the  Shadowguide  to  cycle  through  the  other  players  at  ap-

THE SHADOW AND THE LINE

The  concept  of  the  Shadow  is  integral  to 
Wraith. It’s also one that can ask a lot of players, 
both in terms of trust and in terms of execution. 
There’s always the possibility that Shadowguiding 
can be too effective, that it can impact the player 
as  well  as  the  character  and  make  the  gaming 
experience uncomfortable. Players should always 
feel  comfortable  asking  their  Shadowguide  to 
back off if they’re pushing buttons too hard, and 
Shadowguides  should  always  be  mindful  that 
they’re  in  conflict  with  the  character,  not  the 
player. If a Shadowguide is making another player 
uncomfortable,  the  Storyteller  should  have  no 
compunctions about asking him to tone it down, 
switching  Shadowguiding  assignments,  or  even 
having that player stop filling the Shadowguide 
role. While Wraith can and sometimes should go 
into deep and personal territory, that’s no excuse for 
making other players feel uncomfortable or unsafe. 

THE SHADOW

237

propriate moments. Doing so can be a way to manage players 
wanting to have an intense Shadowguide experience outside 
of Harrowings, while keeping sessions between those largely 
one-character-centered  Shadow  experiences  ones  where  the 
Shadowguide can speak out as needed as different Shadows. If 
a Shadowguide excels at playing each Shadow regardless of the 
number of players, spotlighting characters in your chronicle may 
not feel as needed to manage everyone’s stories, but they can 
always be an option during critical periods of character growth.

• Storyteller Shadows 
Putting  the  portrayal  of  Shadows  entirely  into  the  Sto-
ryteller’s hands puts added work onto the Storyteller, but can 
be the best option for some troupes. If the players are new to 
Wraith,  or  uncomfortable  for  any  reason  with  roleplaying  a 
Shadow  (or  don’t  want  other  players  seeing  their  character 
sheets),  Storyteller  control  of  the  Shadow  takes  pressure  off 
the players instead of forcing them into roleplaying something 
that’s outside their comfort zone. This also keeps players from 
having to become familiar with each other’s character sheets. 
It’s easier for players to roleplay not knowing intimate details 
concerning character traits or backgrounds that haven’t been 
revealed in play if they simply don’t know them. Most players 
have the maturity and roleplaying skill to compartmentalize 
what they know as someone’s Shadow versus their own charac-
ter, but not knowing something at all about another character 
gives them the opportunity to react to reveals during play in 
as fresh a way as possible.

When it comes to Storytellers taking on the work of ro-
leplaying the Shadows, it’s important to use this method in a 
game where doing so would be practical. A six-person Wraith 
game is going to be strenuous at best for a Storyteller to run, 
and adding six different Shadows on top of it may be too much. 
This  method  can  supplement  traditional  Shadowguiding;  in 
this case the Storyteller will play the Shadows for players who 
don’t want other players to be their Shadowguides, or will step 
in to be a Shadowguide instead of players who aren’t ready to 
Shadowguide yet. In terms of troupe size, this approach shines 
the most when used by troupes with two to three players.

• Deterministic Shadowguiding 
To  keep  the  influence  of  Shadows  present  in  the  story, 
but freeing the table from the added responsibilities of Shad-
owguiding, you can use some basic information from Shadow 
Creation — and some Storyteller input — to make Deterministic 
Shadowguiding work for your group. Shadows will still need 
to be written for each character, and that can be done by the 
players themselves. Since there’s no Shadowguide to consult, 
players helping each other with Shadow ideas is one way to 
help players avoid being stymied during the Shadow creation 
process. Storytellers should have some one-on-one time with 
each  player  to  get  a  sense  of  their  Shadow;  Shadows  have 
desires and aims different from the Psyche, and in this method 
Storytellers are going to have to do some pulling and guiding 
to make sure those desires don’t go unused or unfaced. 

During play, instead of a Shadowguide offering a player 
Shadow Dice, this offering is instead done by the Storyteller. 
Angst is still tracked normally, and the rules for Catharsis rolls 
still work the same. In this method of Shadowguiding, Storytellers 
are able to contribute color to scenes when appropriate if the 
Psyche loses their roll, whether that’s at the table or away from 
everyone else. The player is still the one to portray the switch 
of Psyche to Shadow if the Psyche should fail. As the Angst of 
a player’s character increases, a group could add a little atmo-
sphere by writing a brief list together of ways a wraith may begin 
to think or act as their Angst becomes stronger. These can act 
as helpful hints for players who want to think about how their 
character’s Angst influences how to play them, or how their 
character’s thinking may be changing. This method puts some 
extra responsibility on the player in terms of their roleplaying, 
and doesn’t work well for Harrowings. If your group decides 
this is the Shadowguiding method for them, Harrowings will 
need to be shifted primarily into the hands of the Storyteller, 
to make up for the absence of a Shadowguide providing input 
and driving force into the Harrowing.

• No Shadow
You can’t have a Wraith without a Shadow. To remove it 
from its connection to the Psyche is to lobotomize the Psyche. 
Because Shadows are one of the strongest elements of Wraith: 
The Oblivion, removing them entirely from the game is impos-
sible to do while still playing Wraith. But you and your players 
may choose to remove Shadows from the table during play. This 
would mean no one would portray a Shadow, and there would be 
no roleplaying that engaged with a player character’s Shadow. 
Using Deterministic Shadowguiding is a best case option if your 
table is simply trying to remove roleplaying Shadows from the 
game. It allows players and the Storyteller to keep track of the 
Psyche’s proximity to Oblivion, and helps shape how players 
portray their characters in relation to their Angst. 

If your troupe decided it would like to forgo using Shadows 
entirely, determine what that means. Deciding to have no “on 
screen” Shadowguiding may fit your group consensus about the 
most important parts of your game to focus on during a session. 
Using that option could allow for doing brief narrative summaries 
of what your Shadow’s been up to between games, whether that’s 
done by the Storyteller, fellow players, or yourself. Should your 
troupe wish to completely remove Shadows from the table, how 
far they want to go with that is going to influence how your 
troupe engages with the game content and the rules. Shadows 
are ticking clocks that dog characters, a grim and uncomfortable 
reality of their life after death. Deciding to simply not focus on 
Shadows and figuring out how or if that influences the rules 
being used in your game is an avenue to not use Shadows, but 
keep them a thematic element in the background. It does change 
the tenor of the game to shift Shadows deeply off screen and 
out of play, so it’s important to make sure everyone at your table 
wants to keep Shadows so far out of sight.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Shadow Example of Play

John and Mindy are members of Leah’s troupe, and have 
been assigned as each other’s Shadowguides. John’s character 
Leo  is  a  former  artist  from  Chicago  who’s  looking  to  stave 
off Oblivion through creating works of enduring beauty, and 
Mindy makes a careful note of some of the key elements on his 
Shadow character sheet: key Fetters like family and a favorite 
work of art, Passions related to creation and drive, and Thorns 
like Mirror, Mirror. Leo’s Shadow also has Dark Passions like 
“Force Everyone to Acknowledge My Brilliance” (Ego) ••••, 
and the Archetype of the False Friend. That, Mindy decides, 
is plenty to go on.

In  the  game’s  current  scenario,  the  Circle  uncovered 
evidence  of  a  Doppelganger  working  within  the  Chicago 
Necropolis’  power  structure.  Every  attempt  to  report  this  to 
the local authorities has backfired, as the Doppelganger is one 
step ahead of them at every turn. With the city turning against 
them, they decide to get out of the city and go to Stygia in 
hopes of finding someone who will believe them — and hope 
the Doppelganger’s lies haven’t poisoned the entire Hierarchy 
against them.

Originally, the plan is for the group to seek passage out of 
the city together. But Mindy decides that Leo’s Shadow doesn’t 
want  any  part  of  that.  Instead,  drawing  on  the  False  Friend 
Archetype, she leans over during the debate over what to do 
and, as the Shadow, whispers a cutting comment about one of 
the other wraiths in John’s ear. John busts up laughing, which 
immediately gets him suspicious questions from the rest of the 
group (including Mindy’s character, Lydia). Leo tries to explain 
why he’s laughing without letting on that it’s at a joke at one of 
his friends’ expense, and things go predictably badly. By the end 
of the discussion, none of the other wraiths want to be around 
Leo right now, and he announces that he can get them passage 
to Stygia faster than they can. The group splits up, with Leo 
(and his Shadow) headed one way and the rest headed another.
With the group split up, Leah decides to run the larger 
faction first. John participates as Lydia’s Shadowguide, meaning 
that everyone’s still involved even though the group has split up.
But the larger faction’s attempts to get a ticket to Stygia fail 
for various reasons, and Leah declares that it’s time to switch 
over to Leo’s “solo” adventure for the moment. Most of the rest 
of the troupe decides this is a good time for a bathroom break 
or whatnot, but Mindy sticks around to play Shadowguide.

Wandering  alone  through  the  Necropolis,  Leo  starts  to 
wonder if maybe he should have just apologized. His Shadow 
wants none of this, though, and Mindy engages Leo in a running 
debate about how the rest of the group is a bunch of small-timers 
and Leo’s better off leading them — or without them. Leah 
eventually sends Mindy a note asking her to tone it down a bit 
— while the roleplaying is excellent, the constant conversation 
with the Shadow is getting to be a bit too much, and Leo needs 
some space to operate on his own. Mindy nods and backs off, 

and Leo heads for the ghostly banks of the Chicago River in 
hopes of finding someone who can help him.

As Leo’s an artist, he’s a little bit out of place among the 
ghosts of longshoremen, dock workers, and freighter captains. 
Leah suggests that he roll Perception + Streetwise (difficulty 7) 
to see if he can identify someone who’d be a good fit. Looking 
at his character sheet, John notes that while Leo has 4 dots in 
Perception, he’s got nothing in Streetwise, and he’s not feeling 
too confident about success. Mindy takes this opportunity to 
step in as the Shadow, offering him four extra dice to roll with. 
Torn between not wanting to rely on his Shadow and wanting 
to make sure he succeeds at this important task, Leo negotiates, 
asking for 1 die only. He and his Shadow ultimately compromise 
on three, and they roll. On the main dice, it’s 8, 7, 2, 2, while 
the Shadow Dice come up 9, 8 and 1. Leah rules it’s a healthy 
success, and points out a likely-looking target, an older wraith in 
bad-weather gear whose face shows clear Harbinger guildmarks. 
Meanwhile, Mindy adds a point of temporary Angst from the 1 
on the Shadow Dice roll. She’s now up to 6, not quite enough 
to launch a Catharsis attempt, but it’s getting close.

Leo walks over and introduces himself to the wraith, who 
declares that he’s the captain of a freighter headed downriver 
to Stygia in the morning, but that he’s willing to take on pas-
sengers  for  a  ridiculous  number  of  oboli  and  the  willingness 
to work their passage. Leo makes a counteroffer of some relics 
(mostly belonging to his Circlemates, his Shadow points out) 
and  agrees  to  help  defend  the  ship  if  it’s  attacked,  and  the 
discussion gets going in earnest.

As negotiations reach a critical moment, Mindy decides 
now  is  the  time  for  the  Shadow  to  really  get  involved.  She 
passes a note to Leah saying that she’s using Mirror, Mirror, 
a Thorn that temporarily makes the wraith appear horrific or 
threatening. It’s Mindy’s hope that doing so will scare the ship 
captain off and deny the Circle passage to Stygia.

Leah rolls Perception to check the captain’s reaction and 
gets 3 failures. She decides this means that, rather than reading 
the flash of horror as proof that Leo’s a dangerous passenger he 
doesn’t want on board, he gets frightened instead and quickly 
agrees to transport the entire Circle to Stygia. Leo knows some-
thing’s up but can’t figure out what, and his Shadow certainly 
isn’t going to enlighten him. So he just goes with the flow and 
takes the captain’s change of heart at face value. 

The Shadow is disappointed, but not for long. After the 
encounter with the captain wraps up, Leo rejoins the rest of the 
Circle. After they recount their exploits, he brags about what a 
fantastic negotiator he is and (egged on by comments from his 
Shadow) how the group owes him one for pulling this off. Mindy 
looks at the Shadow sheet and sees that 4-dot Dark Passion, and 
checks with Leah. Leah agrees — it’s clearly a fit — and has 
Mindy roll 4 dice. They come up 9, 8, 8, 2: 3 successes. Mindy 
adds the points of temporary Angst to the Shadow’s character 
sheet and smiles — that’s up to 9 temporary, enough for her to 
attempt Catharsis and seize control. When the right moment 
comes along, she’ll be ready…

THE SHADOW

239

Harrowings

  Harrowing  is  a  nightmare  ride  through 
the  deepest  parts  of  the  Underworld,  a 
psychodrama  starring  an  unlucky  wraith, 
and directed by the wraith’s Shadow with 
a supporting cast of Spectres. Harrowings 
are specifically designed to torture a wraith, 
empower her Shadow, and force her into 
making mistakes, ones that may rip away her Passions, Fetters, or 
her very essence, and send her plummeting down to Oblivion. To 
some extent, a Harrowing is a test of self-knowledge, a challenge 
to the wraith from her Shadow to choose the right course of 
action. Make the right call and she escapes from the nightmare 
unscathed. Make the wrong one and the consequences are dire. 
And of course, the Shadow tries to stack the deck so that the 
wraith chooses incorrectly, or to make every choice seem so 
bad that it feels like there’s no way out. Failure to puzzle out a 
Harrowing can lead to weakening or loss of Fetters or Passions, 
and in some cases, even destruction. Solving a Harrowing means 
the wraith escapes unscathed, but weary and wary. Though she 
may be unharmed, she is not unchanged. 

When  a  wraith  experiences  something  that  threatens  to 
weaken her connection to the world of the living, be it losing 

a Fetter, a Passion, or all of her Willpower or Corpus, her mind 
fights back against the break. Simultaneously, her Shadow works 
to encourage it, eager to divorce the wraith from anything that 
would anchor her against Oblivion. The eternal struggle of life 
urge and death urge plays out, the paradox of Restless existence 
embodied in the wraith’s simultaneous need for Fetters and Pas-
sions to secure her existence while at the same time ultimately 
needing to let go in order to obtain Transcendence. 

It is said that Harrowings were originally purely designed for 
teaching, ways for wraiths to come to grips with their Passions 
and Fetters and understand them better in order to grow beyond 
them. Wraiths who were afraid of what the potential loss of self 
to Transcendence might entail were, through Harrowings, forced 
to confront their Shadows and their anchors to their previous 
lives. This encounter would enable the reticent wraiths to deal 
with those challenges and prepare themselves to move on. They 
were cathartic events, giving wraiths a better self-knowledge 
and a chance to force their Shadows to stand down. 

Somewhere  along  the  line,  Harrowings  changed.  What 
were once debates between Psyche and Shadow fell under the 
Labyrinth’s  purview.  Now  they  have  become  vicious  puzzles 
where wraiths are forced to confront their own weaknesses and 
risk their own destruction by doing so. Now Harrowings are 
things of horror and loss, and any insight a wraith manages to 
wrest for herself from the proceedings is bitterly won through 

240

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

her own efforts. Transcendence no longer has any part to play 
here. Harrowings are now about survival. 

What Actually Happens

When a character is pulled down into a Harrowing, he 
becomes  the  star  in  a  perverse  psychodrama  scripted  by  his 
own subconscious. In essence, the wraith lands in a nightmare 
landscape where anything can happen and anyone can appear. 
Harrowings are nightmares, and it’s nightmare logic that applies. 
Old lovers can appear out of nowhere, loving parents can be 
twisted into monstrous caricatures, and childhood heroes can 
step onstage only to reveal themselves as monsters. Within the 
players’ comfort zones, anything and everything is fair game, 
and no idea is too illogical or strange. Once a wraith is trapped 
inside a Harrowing, there’s no way out except by plunging deeper 
in. Only by understanding what the Harrowing is viciously and 
unfairly testing can a wraith escape. Failure, bad choices, and 
refusal to engage, on the other hand, lead inevitably to failure 
and force the wraith to pay a heavy price before moving on. 

During  a  Harrowing,  a  wraith  may  use  his  Arcanoi,  his 
Willpower (except for his last point) and any of his Abilities 
that seem pertinent. They must all, however, be used within 
the context of the Harrowing; using Arcanoi to try and rip a 
hole  through  the  proceedings  and  climb  out  simply  doesn’t 
work. In its own way, a Harrowing is very real, and the very 
nature of the Underworld bends around it to ensure that there 
are no shortcuts. 

A Harrowing occurs when a wraith is dragged down by Oblivion 
for various reasons (see below) into the Labyrinth, where Spectres 
await their chance to coordinate with his Shadow in order to use 
him as a temporary plaything. As soon as one of the Harrowing 
conditions is met, a small Nihil opens directly underneath the 
wraith and he plummets immediately down to one of the innumer-
able chambers of the Labyrinth devoted to staging Harrowings. 
There is no escaping the descent. Argos is helpless against it, and 
no Artifact has ever been known to stand against it. The descent 
is sudden and terrifying, and the Nihil generally closes so quickly 
after the wraith is sucked down that it is impossible for anyone 
to  follow.  And  attempting  to  follow  by  conventional  means  is 
generally impossible. The speed of the descent is too great, the 
Labyrinth too large, the obstacles in the way too numerous and 
too strong. By and large, all a wraith’s companions can do is stand 
and wait and hope for their friend’s return. 

As the wraith plummets, her Shadow is in constant com-
munication with the Spectres waiting at the other end of the 
ride, filling them in on their victim’s Passions, Fetters, and per-
sonal history, the better to plan the torments of the Harrowing. 
Phobias, regrets, missed chances, and bad choices — all are grist 
for the mill. The Spectres take this information and run with 
it, creating the setting for the Harrowing and pulling together 
the props, set dressing, and disguises necessary from the Laby-
rinth’s vast storehouses of flotsam or the Tempest itself. Hasty 
Moliate jobs turn leering Doppelgangers into long-lost loved 
ones, the quality of the work aided and abetted by the reality-

THE DIRECTORS OF THE ACTION

Within  the  Labyrinth  there  are  cadres  of 
Spectres who do nothing but prepare for and run 
Harrowings. While they haven’t quite split off to 
form their own caste yet, they are self-contained 
and have little to do with the politics of the rest of 
Spectre-kind. Some say they serve a very particular 
Malfean, while others think they are merely so 
dedicated to their creative Dark Passions and so 
successful at doing Oblivion’s work that they are 
granted a certain hellish autonomy. In either case, 
the makers of Harrowings cut across caste lines. 
Shades, Nephwracks, Striplings, and Doppelgang-
ers  all  come  together  like  a  demented  theater 
troupe, with all their efforts bent toward creating 
the most devastating Harrowings possible. 

Each  Harrowing  has  a  Director,  the  Spec-
tre  who  leads  the  Harrowing  troupe  and  who 
is in closest contact with the victim’s Shadow. 
Together, the two of them plan and shape the 
Harrowing, describing its contours and its solu-
tion  and  assigning  roles  to  the  Spectres  who 
are going to populate it. Once the action starts, 
artistic control rests in the hands of the Spectre, 
though the Shadow continues to offer its insight 
and assistance. 

warping effects of the Harrowing itself. When the wraith arrives, 
deposited ever-so-gently in one of the vast caverns dedicated 
to Harrowings, the stage is set and all the players are in place. 
Within  the  Harrowing,  dream  logic  rules.  Items  can  be 
plucked from thin air, the action can teleport form place to 
place, and new actors can simply materialize. This is a function 
of the Harrowing, and trying to understand what’s going on 
will only make it worse. The one rule is that everything that 
happens does so at the whim of the Harrowing’s creators: the 
victim’s Shadow and the Spectre directing the action.

Wraiths leave Harrowings the same way they arrive: rapidly. 
Once the Harrowing is over, for good or for ill, they’re not long 
for the Labyrinth. The lucky and successful ones are spat back 
out at a safe location near their original point of departure, or at 
a Fetter or Haunt. Those who fail Harrowings find themselves 
adrift in the Tempest, in no immediate danger but potentially 
far from home or help. Those who fail Destruction Harrowings 
are  pulled  down  into  the  maw  of  Oblivion  without  help  or 
recourse. It’s all over instantly, with no time for a parting shot, 
either on the part of the departing wraith or the potentially 
disappointed Spectres. The Harrowing is essentially discrete, and 
once it finishes all involved must deal with the consequences 
immediately and move on.

Q: How long does a Harrowing take?

HARROWING LOGISTICS: A GUIDE

A: As long as it needs to. Time flows differently inside the Labyrinth, more so inside a Harrowing. One can 
take seconds, minutes — or in extreme cases, years. How long it takes in a given play scenario is entirely 
up to the Storyteller.

Q: What does the Shadow do during a Harrowing?

A: Advises the Spectres who are mounting the production. As the Harrowing is purely a test of the Psyche, 
the Shadow cannot use Thorns, offer Shadow Dice or otherwise act directly on the wraith at the center 
of the action. Ideally, the local Spectres are keeping the wraith sufficiently busy anyway.

Q: Where does a wraith go after the Harrowing’s over?

A: If she wins, back to where she started (or a safe place nearby — this prevents wraiths from being repeatedly 
bounced into and out of Harrowings as they fall, emerge, are attacked, and fall again.) Conversely, if the 
Storyteller feels it’s more appropriate, she can emerge at a Fetter or Haunt. This potentially facilitates 
either the story or the process of getting the player characters back together, as needed. Wraiths who fail 
Harrowings are dropped into the Tempest, and must make their own way from there. Wraiths who fail 
Destruction Harrowings fall immediately into the Void and are seen no more.

Q: Can a wraith use Shadow Dice for a post-Harrowing roll?

A: No. And hopefully, they know better than to ask.

Q: What happens to my character’s gear when she falls into a Harrowing?

A: If she’s carrying or wearing it, it goes with her. If not, it stays behind. 

Q: What if my character exits a Harrowing but has no Fetters and can’t return to the Shadowlands, even if 

that’s where the rules say that’s where she’s supposed to go?

A: In that case, the wraith is thrown into a calm area of the Tempest, or perhaps washes up on the banks of 
the Great River. In either case, she will be in no immediate danger while she recovers from the Harrowing.

Getting Out

The surest way to get out of a Harrowing is to solve the 
puzzle and roleplay a solution. Note that while the Storyteller 
and Shadowguide should agree on a solution to the Harrowing 
before play starts, a player who comes up with a sufficiently clever 
and appropriate alternate solution should not be penalized. The 
Storyteller has the leeway to award success for an alternate ap-
proach if she deems it worthwhile and dramatically satisfying, 
though this approach should not be overused.

Alternately, at the end of a Harrowing the victim has not 
successfully roleplayed her way out of, the Storyteller has the 
option of offer a dice roll that determines whether the Harrowed 
character succeeds or fails. It is important to remember that the 
roll determining success or failure is not just a random toss of 
the dice, but rather is a roll made after the character undergoes 
the Harrowing itself and has a chance to react to it. 

As  noted  previously,  all  Harrowings  have  some  sort  of 
dilemma or test for the wraith at their heart. If the Harrowed 
wraith roleplays well and makes intelligent choices, thus finding 

and solving the core dilemma she is been presented with, there’s 
no need for a dice roll. The wraith has earned victory — and 
escape — on her own merits, and does not need to resort to 
the dice for a second chance.

On the other hand, not every wraith will be able to solve 
his Harrowing through roleplaying alone. Sometimes it’s luck, 
sometimes they can’t figure it out, and sometimes the pressure 
of the Harrowing makes it impossible to find a way out. If that’s 
the case, after a reasonable amount of time (10 minutes is a good 
baseline) passes and it becomes clear the wraith’s not making 
any progress on the Harrowing, then the Storyteller should step 
in and move things along. The action of the Harrowing comes 
to an end, the sets crash down, and the player must make a roll 
(permanent Willpower, difficulty 9) to see if his character was 
somehow able to triumph in spite of it all. A single success is 
enough to grant victory and get the wraith out, intact. At Sto-
ryteller discretion, good roleplaying — even if it doesn’t find the 
solution — during the Harrowing can reduce the difficulty of the 
roll, though it should never be made easy to escape a Harrowing. 
The Shadow cannot offer additional dice for this roll. To do so 
would run counter to the actual mission of the Harrowing. 

242

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Modifying the Odds

While Spectres and the Shadow set the scene for a Harrow-
ing, the wraith is not entirely defenseless. Wraiths who have a 
rating in Eidolon may, one time per session, roll against their 
Eidolon (difficulty 9). Each success rolled allows the wraith to 
exert her will on the Harrowing, and to modify one aspect of 
the scenario to her liking. This should make it easier for her to 
figure out the solution to the puzzle the Harrowing presents. 
Any changes made by the player to the Harrowing must be in 
line with the overall concept of the scene. Suddenly adding 
giant robots to a Harrowing about the death of the character’s 
mother is probably out of bounds; adding those same robots as 
allies in a hero fantasy makes much more sense. If the player 
chooses to roll on his character’s Eidolon rating, he may do so 
at any time up until the ending of the Harrowing. 

A player can also spend Willpower to affect a Harrowing. 
One Willpower point can be spent for an automatic success on 
the Eidolon roll or on the final escape roll (or on both if the char-
acter has enough Willpower remaining). Players can also spend 
Willpower during the action of the Harrowing, though this is not 
necessarily an optimal strategy for dealing with the situation. If the 
wraith is down to one Willpower point, they cannot spend it in this 
fashion, for obvious reasons. Running out of Willpower is, after all, 
one of the things that will drop a wraith into a Harrowing, making 
it impossible for a wraith to do so while actually in a Harrowing.

Harrowing Systems and Targets

There are two different kinds of Harrowings. While they 
have the same basic structure, they have different targets and 
potential  outcomes,  and  as  such  can  be  differentiated  from 
one another. 
Targeted Harrowings

The  first  type  of  Harrowing  is  one  in  which  one  of  a 
wraith’s  Passions  or  Fetters  is  targeted  by  her  Shadow  in  an 
attempt to destroy it. Doing so weakens the wraith’s ties to the 
world of the living. A wraith whose Passions and Fetters have 
been weakened in this way is colder and more distant, and has 
fewer things capable of anchoring her in the Shadowlands. In 
addition, a wraith whose Passions have been weakened is that 
much  less  skilled  at  harvesting  Pathos,  making  them  more 
vulnerable to future attacks. 

The target of a Harrowing is called the Quarry, as it is the 
object of the metaphorical hunt the Shadow initiated. In some 
cases, the Quarry is predetermined, say, if the Harrowing is trig-
gered by the loss of a particular Fetter or Passion. In others, the 
Shadow is allowed to pick the Quarry from the list of available 
targets. Regardless, having the action of the Harrowing reflect 
on the Quarry helps bring home what exactly is at stake. So, 
a Harrowing that is about a two-point Passion of “Protect My 
Family (Love)” could focus on putting family members in peril, 
or on the wraith being forced to turn his back on his family 

THE SHADOW

243

because  of  another  obligation,  or  about  the  wraith’s  family 
desecrating  his  memory.  There  are  always  plenty  of  options 
available. It’s up to the Storyteller, Shadowguide, and troupe 
to pick the best one and make it memorable.

The following events can trigger a Targeted Harrowing:
• The wraith loses (or uses up) all of her Willpower. As she 
is on the verge of losing that final point, which would bring her 
to zero Willpower, she immediately undergoes a Harrowing that 
targets either a Passion or a Fetter of the Shadowguide’s choice. 
For Willpower-driven Harrowings, the most likely targets are 
low-level traits, particularly ones that the wraith has neglected 
recently. Fetters that haven’t been visited and Passions that 
haven’t been indulged are ripe for a Harrowing to pick off. If 
the wraith succeeds at the Harrowing, she has the option of 
snapping back to a Fetter (preferably the Quarry) or Haunt, or 
to a safe spot near where she was originally pulled down into 
the Harrowing. She also keeps her last Willpower point, and 
adds an additional number equal to her Intelligence rating. If, 
however, she fails, she loses one point off the Quarry’s current 
rating. If that drops the rating to zero, then the Quarry is con-
sidered lost forever. The bereft wraith then is ejected from the 
Harrowing, and instead finds herself hurled into the Tempest. 
Wraiths who fail in this manner do get Willpower points equal 
to their Intelligence rating restored to them. In either case, the 
wraith emerges from the Harrowing with the same Corpus rating 
they entered it with, regardless of what might have occurred 
during the Harrowing itself. 

• The wraith is on the verge of losing (not Resolving) her 
last point in an individual Passion. So long as she has one point 
in the Passion, she is fine. But when that last point is threatened 
— by neglect or enemy action — she undergoes a Harrowing. 
Wraiths can also lose Passions due to failing a Harrowing, but 
Storytellers should refrain from invoking a second Harrowing 
as a result of failing the first one — particularly over the same 
Passion, which may be gone anyway.

YOU ARE THE QUARRY
At Storyteller discretion, the Passion or Fet-
ter in question in a Willpower-based Harrowing 
can  be  replaced  by  the  wraith  himself.  This  is 
reserved for Harrowings after the wraith has done 
something particularly foolish or inappropriate, 
such  as  blowing  his  last  Willpower  point  on  a 
practical joke. In situations where the wraith is 
the Quarry, failure at a Harrowing costs the wraith 
one  point  of  permanent  Corpus.  This  in  turn 
reduces the wraith’s maximum temporary Corpus 
rating (which can never exceed permanent) by 
one, and thus makes it that much more likely the 
wraith is going to be Harrowed again — soon.

The Harrowing should focus on a theme that involves the 
Passion,  and  the  Passion  should  always  be  the  Quarry  of  the 
Harrowing. For example, if the Passion that is being threatened 
is “Protect my son (Love),” the Harrowing might seem to take 
place in a crowd in a disaster, with dozens of lookalikes of the son 
making it impossible to find the real one. Success has the same 
result as a success in a Willpower Harrowing, and the targeted 
Passion is maintained at its current level. However, if the victim 
fails, not only does he lose the Quarry Passion, but he also must 
roll against the rating of a different Passion (Storyteller discretion 
as to which Passion, difficulty 5) as well. A failure on this roll 
subtracts one dot from the rating of the second Passion. 

• The wraith is on the verge of losing (not Resolving) her 
last point in a Fetter. When a living Fetter dies or a nonliving 
Fetter is destroyed, the character whose Fetter was lost is im-
mediately thrown into this sort of Harrowing. This Harrowing 
proceeds just as one for a Passion does, but the Fetter is the 
Quarry, and it becomes part of the scenery or a player in the 
psychodrama. Successes and failures are handled in the same 
way as for Passions, though if the wraith just lost his last Fetter, 
he is no longer able to exist in the Shadowlands, as he has lost 
that which anchored him to the lands of the living. He must 
now dwell in the deeper Underworld for the rest of his wraithly 
existence — or seek to acquire new Fetters. 

Failures are handled in a similar fashion to those in Passion-
based Targeted Harrowings. If the wraith was pulled into this 
sort of Harrowing because of the destruction or death of one of 
her Fetters, succeeding in the Harrowing will still not allow the 
wraith to retain that Fetter. Instead, a success will allow her to 
consider the Fetter Resolved instead of destroyed.

• The wraith lost all of her temporary Corpus, or has taken 
a point of lethal damage while wavering. In this case, the wraith 
herself is the Quarry of the Harrowing. Again, success allows 
the wraith to escape back to a Fetter or Haunt, or to return to 
a spot near where she was originally Harrowed, and recover as 
many points of temporary Corpus as she has dots in Stamina. 
Failure results in the loss of one point of permanent Corpus. 
If a wraith loses her last point of permanent Corpus as a result 
of a temporary Corpus Harrowing, she immediately falls into a 
Destruction Harrowing (see below).
Destruction Harrowings

Destruction Harrowings occur only under extreme circum-
stances, as they directly threaten a wraith’s continued existence. 
In these rare instances, the wraith becomes the Quarry, rather 
than a Passion or a Fetter, and the price of failure is utter de-
struction. A Destruction Harrowing is activated when:

• The wraith is on the verge of losing her last point in her 
last remaining Passion. Her emotions have become so numbed 
that she is a step away from feeling nothing and thus becoming 
nothing.  Without  functioning  Passions,  there  is  nothing  to 
fuel her existence as a wraith. If the player does not succeed in 
the Harrowing on her own terms, she should roll permanent 

244

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Willpower against her Shadow’s permanent Angst (difficulty 6). 
Should the wraith win, she is transported to one of her Fetters 
(assuming she still has any), a Haunt, or a safe location near her 
position when the Harrowing began, and retains that last point 
of her last Passion. Failure strips her of her last strong emotion, 
opening her to the nothingness of Oblivion and allowing her 
to dissolve into the Void.

• The wraith is reduced to zero permanent Corpus. With 
even her tenuous hold on the reality of the Underworld eroded 
to the point of dissolution, she stands on the brink. The system 
is the same as above, with the wraith rolling her permanent 
Willpower versus the Shadow’s permanent Angst (difficulty 6). 
Success snaps her back to a Fetter (if she has any remaining) 
or Haunt, or to a safe spot near where she fell into the Har-
rowing. Once there, she immediately recovers a single point 
each  of  temporary  and  permanent  Corpus.  Failure  results  in 
the wraith’s immediate destruction. The character is dragged 
screaming into Oblivion, and the player should consider what 
sort of character she’d like to play next. Alternately, the Story-
teller can offer the player the option of having their character 
transform into a Spectre of the Nephwrack caste. The player 
can then attempt to continue to play that character, or hand it 
over to the Storyteller, possibly with the option of playing its 
Psyche should it ever encounter the group. Such options are 
best offered in private.

Rewards

Should a wraith successfully overcome the Harrowing, she 
should receive some sort of reward. For a Targeted Harrowing, if 
the wraith successfully “defended” a Passion or Fetter (especially 
one she may have recently neglected) with good roleplaying 
or clever thinking, it should be increased by one point. Thus, 
a Fetter that was a three point now becomes a four point. (De-
stroyed Fetters cannot, for obvious reasons, have their ratings 
increased.)  For  Destruction  Harrowings,  the  wraith  receives 
a decrease of one to three points (depending on the difficulty 
of the Harrowing and the specifics of the player’s roleplaying) 
of  temporary  Angst.  This  represents  a  boost  to  the  wraith’s 
confidence due to her success and the relief at having escaped 
the Harrowing. 

Group Harrowings

There are rare occasions when an entire group of wraiths 
undergoes  a  simultaneous  Harrowing.  This  may  come  about 
through the loss of a Fetter held in common, or all of them 
may  be  stripped  of  their  Corpus  at  the  same  time  (say,  in  a 
firefight or Maelstrom). Whatever the cause, in instances like 
this the wraiths undergo a Harrowing all together, rather than 
as individuals. In general, the mechanics for a group Harrow-
ing are the same as for the individual version, and all of the 
wraiths involved are tested in some fashion (the tests may be 
individual or group in nature, as per Storyteller preference). 
Obviously, in a group Harrowing the players are too busy with 

THE SHADOW

245

their characters to play the parts of Spectres. This additional 
task instead falls to the Storyteller.

At the conclusion of the group Harrowing, either all of 
the wraiths succeed or all must roll to determine the outcome. 
There’s no middle ground. If that happens and the Harrowing 
was caused by the loss of a shared Fetter, the group must decide 
whether they’re all in this together or if it’s every wraith for 
himself. If the group Harrowing was caused by Corpus loss, then 
it’s the individual option, and each wraith’s fate is personal. 

If each of the wraiths is on her own, then each wraith rolls 
and succeeds or fails individually. If the circumstances allow 
and the group agrees that they’re all in it together, then one 
wraith rolls for the entire group. Fortunately, that would be the 
wraith with the highest rating in the shared Fetter, offering the 
group as a whole the best chance of success. If she succeeds, 
everyone succeeds. If she fails, everyone loses the Fetter and 
suffers the consequences. 

Self-Inflicted Harrowings

In circumstances of rare danger, a wraith can choose to 
throw  himself  into  a  Harrowing  rather  than  face  whatever’s 
about to happen — be it the forges, a finishing blow from the 
claws of a Shade, or being shredded by the winds of a five-Bell 
Maelstrom. However, not every wraith knows this is an option, 
and not every attempt is successful. To self-inflict a Harrowing, 
the wraith must roll Willpower (difficulty 9) and score at least 
2 successes. The Shadow can offer Shadow dice for this roll, 
and may have every incentive to do so. However, there is a 
time limit — extended dickering will likely mean the moment 
when the wraith could have Harrowed himself passed and it’s 
now too late for Shadow and Psyche alike.

A self-triggered Harrowing is always a Destruction Har-
rowing, regardless of what the wraith’s Corpus rating might be. 
Such a desperate gamble must truly be a last resort. The wraith 
who comes to rely on diving into a Harrowing is likely to find 
himself unpleasantly surprised, sooner or later.

Running a Harrowing

Running a Harrowing requires the cooperation of all the 
players involved, especially those not being Harrowed or guid-
ing the Harrowing. It’s a group effort focused on one character, 
where everyone’s contribution is necessary and the group stays 
involved even as one character gets separated.

Once a wraith falls into a Harrowing, the first step is to 
determine what kind of Harrowing it is — Targeted or Destruc-
tion — and what incited it. That will determine everything 
that happens next.

At this point, the player whose character is being Harrowed 
should leave the room. The other players and the Storyteller 
should discuss the details of the Harrowing — what the Quarry 
is, what the escape condition is, what the setting of the Har-
rowing is, and what roles everyone’s going to play in it. The 
Harrowed wraith’s Shadowguide leads this discussion and directs 

the Harrowing, at least until such time as the action starts. This 
discussion should take no more than five minutes. Ideally, the 
Shadowguide has a good enough idea of the wraith he’s been 
attached to that he can whip up a good concept pretty quickly, 
and keep things from bogging down in discussion. 

Once the parameters of the Harrowing are set, the star of 
the show gets invited back into the room. The Storyteller sets 
the  scene  and  the  action  begins,  with  the  Harrowed  wraith 
having roughly 10 minutes to figure out the resolution to the 
Harrowing. During that time, the other players take the part 
of  the  various  Spectres  putting  on  the  Harrowing,  with  the 
wraith’s Shadowguide ideally taking a lead role. 

If the wraith figures out how to beat the Harrowing, it ends 
immediately and the wraith returns to the higher Underworld. 
However, at the end of 10 or so minutes, if the Storyteller feels 
that no progress is being made or that the wraith has failed, she 
can end the Harrowing by fiat. At that point, the Harrowed 
wraith gets one last roll to see if he escaped. If he fails this roll, 
then he deals with the consequences as detailed above. 

If, as a result of the first Harrowing the wraith finds them-
selves tumbling into a second one immediately after, then the 
process repeats itself. This sort of scenario should be rare, but 
regardless, the Storyteller always has the option of declaring 
the Harrowing cycle over and removing the victim from the 
Labyrinth, in order to get the main storyline back on the rails.
Harrowings  are  intended  as  punctuation,  moments  of  a 
chronicle when a wraith is particularly at risk and the stakes 
are high. If they happen too often or take too long, then they 
risk slowing down the main chronicle or focusing too much 
attention  on  one  or  two  players.  Keeping  them  infrequent, 
high-powered and tense supports and adds tension to the main 
storyline without desensitizing the players to what’s at stake.

Roleplaying Inside a Harrowing

Roleplaying inside a Harrowing can be tricky for both the 
player and the other members of the troupe. For the target of 
the Harrowing, the important thing is to roleplay the situation. 
The wraith may be aware that she’s in a Harrowing, but that 
doesn’t mean she can simply refuse to play along. Loudly declar-
ing “Nope, this is just a Harrowing and I’m not doing this” runs 
counter to the rules of the universe, the ones everyone — even 
the most stubborn wraith — implicitly accepts. The Harrowing 
is a gauntlet based on the wraith’s own personality and history 
that must be run. To deny its validity to is to deny one’s self, 
and to refuse to confront it, even on its own terms, is to sur-
render. Instead, the star of the Harrowing needs to take the 
scenario as it comes and work with its internal logic to find a 
reasonable solution. That means engaging with the scenario, the 
other actors in the scene (even if they are disguised Spectres), 
and the concept of the Harrowing as a whole. Harrowings are 
nightmares, obeying no logic except their own, and need to 
be engaged as such.

246

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

As for the other players, their part in the Harrowing is to 
support the scene’s ultimate goal. That means agreeing on the 
part assigned to them and playing it within the context of the 
Harrowing. They’re not there to “win” or to make it impossible 
for the wraith to succeed; they’re part of the overall scene and 
are there to support its reality. So aggressively trying to force 
the wraith to fail her Harrowing is stepping over the line (un-
less specifically instructed to do so); working in concert with 
the  rest  of  the  group  to  make  the  best  and  most  interesting 
Harrowing experience together is dead on target.

The Contested Harrowing

Not everyone may agree as to a Harrowing’s resolution. 
The Shadowguide may feel like the subject didn’t work out a 
reasonable solution, while the player may feel he was on target. 
In cases like this, the important thing is quick resolution and 
not allowing the disagreement to linger. The Storyteller is the 
final arbiter of success or failure, and while each player should 
feel free to make a case, it’s ultimately the Storyteller’s decision. 
Once that comes down, all parties involved should adjust their 
character sheets as needed and move on.

Of course, there’s a potential story hook in a scenario like 
this. The Spectre responsible for staging the Harrowing with its 
unsatisfactory conclusion may now harbor a grudge. He might 
decide to seek out “the one who got away,” developing a personal 
vendetta against the wraith in question. Or he might simply 
bide his time, waiting for the next time the wraith is Harrowed, 
and plan something particularly special for the occasion. Either 
way, having a master of Harrowings personally interested in a 
wraith’s destruction is going to make things very interesting.
Example of Play: A Harrowing

In combat with a gang of renegade Reapers, John’s char-
acter Leo takes a vicious hit from a relic blunderbuss. Already 
wounded, Leo takes enough damage to spiral down into a Har-
rowing. A small Nihil opens up underneath his feet and he’s 
dragged down into the Labyrinth for a Harrowing.

Leah, who’s Storytelling, decides to finish the encounter 
with the Reapers before dealing with the Harrowing. The combat 
finishes with the Circle routing the Reapers and freeing their 
coffle of prisoners. It’s a satisfactory conclusion to the scene, but 
it hasn’t been achieved painlessly. Leo’s in big trouble. 

Leah sends John out of the room, so the rest of the group 
can discuss what’s about to happen to his character. Mindy plays 
Leo’s Shadow, so Leah informs her she’s in charge of setting up 
the  Harrowing.  Already  familiar  with  Leo’s  character  sheet, 
Mindy decides that the Harrowing is going to focus on one of 
Leo’s Fetters, specifically, his love for Chagall’s America Win-
dows at the Art Institute of Chicago. The windows were Leo’s 
major inspiration in life, and now that he’s passed on they still 
exert a hold. If anything were to happen to them, Leo would 
be devastated. And that, Mindy decides, is why they should be 
the focus of the Harrowing. 

Since the entire Circle will be acting out the Harrowing, 
Mindy asks the group how they think this should be handled. 
Another player suggests a scenario that puts the windows at risk 
of being physically destroyed. Mindy likes this, but points out 
that the Harrowing has to have some kind of puzzle or dilemma 
that John’s going to have to roleplay through for Leo to escape 
unscathed. Leah, seeing that the group could use a little help, 
suggests that maybe Leo should have to choose between sav-
ing the Chagall windows and saving someone he loves. Mindy 
jumps on the idea and sketches out how she wants the Har-
rowing to go: Leo’s going to be in the Art Institute, some sort 
of disaster’s going to strike, and Leo’s going to have to choose 
between saving the lives of his family or the art that matters 
so much to him. There’s no way to save both. But, because this 
is a Harrowing, there’s going to be an endless stream of new 
potential  victims  every  time  Leo  makes  a  move  toward  the 
windows. The only way out is for Leo to come to grips with the 
fact that he’s going to have to let something important to him 
go, knowing that the inspiration it gave him will be with him 
forever. Roles are assigned; the other players will take the parts 
of Spectres imitating Leo’s loved ones or innocent bystanders 
in the museum, while Mindy plays Leo’s “wife.” 

Leah points out that it’s time to bring John back into the 
room. Mindy does a last check to make sure everyone’s clear on 
how they’re going to play it, and tells Leah that they’re ready. 
Leah calls John back into the room, and starts setting the scene…
Leah describes the scene. Leo is walking through his favor-
ite museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, with his wife. As he 
looks around, he sees other people he knows and loves, played 
by the other members of the troupe. They wave and greet him, 
talking about how wonderful it is to see him and how much 
they’re looking forward to seeing the Chagall windows. John 
knows  it’s  a  Harrowing  and  that  something  is  up,  but  so  far 
there’s nothing Leo can do — yet.

Then  Mindy  gives  Leah  the  signal,  and  all  hell  breaks 
loose. There’s a hideous rending sound and suddenly the earth 
shakes. The museum starts to collapse, with pieces of debris 
falling from the ceiling and trapping visitors underneath. Leo 
moves to help the nearest struggling victim, but Mindy, playing 
the Spectre imitating his wife, screams and tells him that the 
windows are about to be crushed and destroyed. Leo is torn; 
John can’t decide what to do. The other members of the troupe 
put the pressure on, clamoring for help when Leo moves to try 
to save them, then turning around and demanding that he save 
the priceless, one-of-a-kind windows instead. Meanwhile, Leah 
describes the steadily widening crack in the ceiling that will 
drop tons of material onto the Chagall exhibit, destroying it 
beyond repair. It’s an impossible situation, once that Leo can’t 
possibly solve by himself. 

John, knowing how important a Fetter America Windows 
is for his character, finally makes a decision. He decides that 
he can’t save everyone but that he can save something that’s 
important to the world, and makes a dash through the falling 

THE SHADOW

247

debris to save the windows, willing to sacrifice himself if neces-
sary to protect them. 

That’s  when  Leah  tightens  the  final  screw.  She  drops  a 
beam on Leo’s “wife,” trapping her beneath. Leo stops and turns 
around. Mindy plays the role to the hilt, telling him to leave 
her, to save the thing that he truly loves.

And finally, Leo gets it. John announces that he’s turning 
his back on the windows to try to rescue his wife. Mindy tries 
to talk him out of it, but his mind is made up: Leo will always 
have his memories of America Windows. It’s time to focus on 
something more important.

Leah confers with Mindy. They agree that the terms of the 
Harrowing have been met successfully, and Leo’s going to make 
it out intact. The scene collapses into rubble, the masks on the 
Spectres drop away, and Leo rises out of the Labyrinth at speed 
toward the safety of the higher Underworld…

Alternate Harrowing Systems

The basic Harrowing rules may not work for every troupe. 
Some players may not want to participate, some groups may 
find it too involved, and some players may not be comfortable 
playing out a Harrowing in front of their peers. If that’s the case, 
there are numerous alternatives to the classic Harrowing style. 
Storyteller  Driven  Harrowing:  If  players  are  uncom-
fortable setting up Harrowings for each other — or a player 

doesn’t want the rest of the group setting up a Harrowing for 
him — then the easiest approach is for the Storyteller to do so 
instead. This has the advantage of keeping other players away 
from too much knowledge about a player’s character. While 
other players can still take part in a Harrowing designed by the 
Storyteller, in this approach they take lesser — and potentially 
less obtrusive — roles.

Mechanistic Harrowing: While Harrowings offer tremen-
dous opportunities for roleplaying, it’s also possible to skip to 
the end and simply have the Harrowed wraith roll to determine 
success or failure. This has the advantage of not requiring the 
troupe to spend time setting up and playing a Harrowing, and 
then trying to get back on track. On the other hand, it denies 
the  Harrowed  wraith  the  chance  to  roleplay  her  way  out  of 
the situation.

Solo  Harrowing:  In  this  variant,  the  Harrowing  is  run 
strictly between player and Storyteller (or optionally, with the 
Shadowguide in attendance as Storyteller support). The other 
players are asked to leave the room. The structure of the Har-
rowing remains similar to the basic rules — the player is asked 
to find a solution to the nightmare scenario — but it’s done 
privately, without other players involved or watching. 

No Harrowing: While not recommended, the No Har-
rowing approach can still be applied. In this instance, rather 
than falling into a Harrowing when certain conditions are met, 

EXAMPLE OF PLAY: FAILED HARROWING

John’s having a run of bad luck, and his character Leo has tumbled into another Harrowing, this time 
by blowing all of his Willpower. Mindy, his Shadowguide, looks at Leo’s character sheet again and decides to 
target his strongest Passion: “Get Things Done Myself (Determination).” It’s a four-dot Passion, so weakening 
it would do Leo some serious damage. Normally, Willpower-based Targeted Harrowings focus on lower-powered 
Traits, but Storyteller Leah thinks about it and gives this one the okay. 

Collaborating with the rest of the troupe, Mindy comes up with a Harrowing concept. Leo’s going to be 
trapped in a dangerous situation that he can get out of easily enough by accepting offers of help. Leah wonders 
if that’s overly simplistic, but Mindy feels there’s a chance that John will overthink it and will doom Leo as 
a result. Leah agrees and nails down the final details — Leo is on a crumbling cliff and the offers of help will 
come from helicopter pilots, rescue technicians, and even incongruous figures like his mom. (It’s a Harrowing, 
after all — the only rules it needs to obey are those of nightmare logic.) All Leo has to do is say “yes” to one 
offer of assistance and understand that he doesn’t always have to do it himself, and he’ll get away cleanly. But 
if he insists on stubbornly trying to do the clearly impossible out of pride, then he’s going to fail.

Sure enough, once play starts Leo refuses every offer of help that comes along. He waves off the rescue 
chopper, tells the park rangers he’s got it and even refuses help from mom (played by Mindy), after wondering 
what she’s doing there. In fact, it’s that last encounter that seals his fate. Leo decides that there has to be a 
catch in every offer of help, and that the only sensible thing to do is refuse. Likewise, he decides that there 
has to be a way out that only he can do, and that all of these helping hands are distractions. 

After 10 minutes of increasingly frantic escape attempts on Leo’s part, all of which fail, Leah rules the 
Harrowing over. She and Mindy agree that Leo did not escape under his own power, and instead fell victim 
to the Harrowing’s insidious effects. John is directed to erase one dot from his strongest Passion. Leo, numbed 
by the shock, now feels less driven and more passive. The scene dissolves around him and he is expelled back 
into the Tempest. Meanwhile, his friends are no doubt wondering what happened to him…

the character is simply knocked unconscious and vanishes for 
a scene. If the Harrowing is induced by the loss of a Fetter or 
Passion, those are simply gone. If it’s caused by loss of Corpus 
or Willpower, the character reappears after the scene with the 

appropriate number (equal to the wraith’s dots in Stamina or 
Intelligence, respectively) points. Each Corpus-based Harrow-
ing costs the player 1 permanent Corpus level, and when the 
character runs out, they’re gone.

THE SHADOW

249

Book Two

host stories are a deeply human response to 
the fear of death and the need to share our 
experiences. Together those two elements 
merge to create something new, a way of 
contextualizing  the  eternal  question  of 
“what  happens  next?”  The  stories  that 
come out of this are part of a time-honored 
tradition, handed down through the millennia from Homer 
to Charles Dickens to Toni Morrison, and adapting to the 
needs of the living along the way. 

Wraith is an extension of the ghost story tradition, which 
is another way of saying that it’s a means of storytelling, and 
that someone has to be the teller of the tales. To a certain 
extent, all the players in a Wraith game are storytellers, adding 
their contributions through their characters and the Shadows 
they control, but the bulk of the work and the responsibility 
falls on the singular Storyteller. The players may portray the 
heroes of a given chronicle, but it’s the Storyteller who plays 
the villains, the noble allies, the informants and bit parts, and 
all the rest of the world entire. It’s the Storyteller who gives 
shape to the world and places the narrative of the chronicle 
within it, and who comes up with the villains’ schemes that 
the players must attempt to foil. 

Newcomers to storytelling games may find them a bit 
different from what they’re used to. Wraith, like other role-
playing games, rests squarely on a foundation of improvisa-
tion. Gameplay consists of the players donning the roles of 

their characters, and then reacting moment to moment to 
the world and characters the Storyteller presents them with. 
The emphasis is on you to decide your words and actions, and 
while there are dice rolls to resolve conflicts and determine 
success or failure, the real heart of the game is the way the 
characters interact. This sort of storytelling freedom can be 
exhilarating,  daunting,  or  both  simultaneously.  With  that 
in mind, this chapter is a guide to Storytelling techniques, 
along with hints, tips, and suggestions for making your Wraith 
game  run  more  smoothly.  There  isn’t  any  “top-secret-for-
Storyteller-eyes-only” information to be had, just ideas on 
what makes a good Wraith chronicle and what sort of pitfalls 
you might want to avoid. You might even want to have your 
players read this, too — after all, they’re telling these stories 
along with you.

The Storyteller

he  role  of  the  Storyteller  in  Wraith  is 
an involved but rewarding one. It’s the 
Storyteller  who  builds  the  world  anew 
every session, who populates it with every 
character not portrayed by a player, and 
who  determines  everything  that  goes 
on during play. Furthermore, the entire 
world needs to be shared on the fly with your players, who 
will interact with it in a manner of their choosing. They will 

Chapter 7:  Storytellingweave their own plot threads and create their own stories, ones 
that may not quite line up with the ones you envisioned when 
you were planning the chronicle. Unlike writing for traditional 
media,  Storytelling  for  Wraith  is  an  interactive  experience. 
The  best  Storytellers  understand  that  the  best  stories  come 
from allowing things to develop naturally in conjunction with 
the players, not from imposing plot from above and competing 
with the players for control of the narrative instead. 

Establishing the setting for the story is one of the Story-
teller’s  largest  responsibilities.  Every  personality  the  players 
meet, every place they go, and everything they see springs from 
your imagination, and it is important to keep that imagination 
flexible.  You  must  define  everything  for  the  players,  serving 
as their guide to the world of your chronicle. You may know 
everything that’s going in that world, but until you manage to 
communicate that to the players — to get them to explore, to 
converse with the wraiths you’ve set up for them to interact with, 
to use their powers and skills to do something — they won’t.

The more complex and detailed the setting you present 
to your players, the more potential stories can be told within 
that setting, and the better the stories will be. Creating a world 
like a Hollywood set, all flats and facades, will inevitably lead 
to disappointment. When the characters turn the corner and 
there’s nothing there for them to do because you didn’t prepare 
for them to go around the block, the players will understand 
that their options are limited and their ability to take mean-
ingful action is limited as well. This can breed frustration, on 
their part and on yours as you struggle to keep the players in 
the bounds you’ve prepared.

Instead, as a Storyteller, you should be prepared to be flex-
ible. You should be ready to adjust if the Circle decides to do 
something completely opposite what you intended, and to do 
so seamlessly, so that the players never get the sense that you 
intended something different. Some of this comes from know-
ing the world and characters you’re Storytelling well enough 
so that you can change up on the fly. If the Circle decides to 
leave town instead of talking to the informant you wanted to 
guide them, there’s no reason you can’t transfer that character’s 
knowledge to someone else, say, the conductor on the car of 
the Midnight Express the Circle is now riding in. 

Your world and the characters who populate it must be 
detailed, so that you can have them respond believably to any 
action the players take. Regardless of how thorough you try to 
be, your players will always find a way to come up with an ac-
tion that you couldn’t have anticipated. If your world has depth 
and flexibility, you’ll be able to integrate these situations into 
your story without any seams showing. If, however, you detail 
only the narrow path that you wish your players to follow, then 
once they stray from that path, both you and they will be lost. 
Using Rules

A big part of the Storyteller’s job is adjudication, decid-
ing what actually happens in the world based on the rules. A 

large portion of this book describes the various rules needed 
for precisely this purpose, covering everything from how the 
various ghostly Arcanoi work to the best dice rolls for simu-
lating a car chase. Ultimately, these rules exist as a guideline 
for you to use, but they’re a starting point, not an absolute. 
Nobody’s going to come to your house to yell at you if you 
decide to fudge the results of a die roll in order to keep the 
action moving. 

Ultimately, you get to judge the validity and interpreta-
tions of the rules and their effect on your story. If you don’t 
like the way the rules work for a particular situation, or some-
thing comes up that the rules don’t cover, then you should 
feel free to improvise so long as you are consistent within the 
framework of your chronicle. Interpreting things differently for 
different players or during different sessions can cause issues 
that can damage a chronicle, and bog play down in questions 
of interpretation. The whole point of the rules is to allow for 
a quick, easy way to simulate the results when a player an-
nounces character intent, and that’s all. 
Entertainment

The most important part of your role as Storyteller, though, 
is to make certain that everyone, including yourself, has a good 
time. Wraith is a game, and as such it is supposed to be a pleas-
ant experience for everyone involved. Don’t confuse putting a 
character in an unpleasant situation with putting that character’s 
player in an uncomfortable situation; make sure that everyone’s 
on board with where you’re going and what you’re doing, and 
that even if you’re dealing with heavy subject matter people 
are satisfied with their experience within the game.

PLAY VS. FUN
As a game, Wraith is intended to be enjoy-
able. However, it also touches on some weighty 
themes: death, faith, identity, grappling with inner 
demons, and more. Moments when these themes 
come to the forefront are often not “fun” in the 
classic  sense  of  the  word.  They  can  be  deeply 
emotional,  cathartic,  and  difficult  for  players 
and Storytellers alike. That being said, there is 
absolutely a place for this kind of play in Wraith. 
Not every adventure has to be lighthearted, not 
every scenario has to be solved by simply punch-
ing a way out. Players and Storytellers who want 
to explore deeper themes within the context of 
Wraith should do so, making sure that all involved 
are okay with the material and the choices, and 
that if things get too real, anyone can call a stop 
at any time.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Keeping everyone involved is a big part of making sure 
that everyone has fun. Letting one player steal the spotlight in 
a solo adventure for half the evening’s play means that everyone 
else is just sitting there waiting, and that’s no fun. If the Circle 
splits  up,  it’s  far  better  to  shift  back  and  forth  between  the 
subgroups at relatively short intervals, ensuring that nobody 
has to wait too long to get in on the action. Plus, there’s always 
Shadowguiding. Encouraging players whose characters aren’t 
involved in the action at the moment to focus on their more 
Oblivion-centric responsibilities can keep them in the game 
even when their characters aren’t. 

Something to remember is that the key element of games is 
interactivity. Players want to play, which is to say they want their 
choices to matter and their actions to affect the world. Holding 
too tight to your idea of the plot when your players want to go 
elsewhere means that you’ll be resorting to increasingly heavy-
handed tactics to keep things on the rails. That in turn makes 
things less believable and reduces the impact the players can 
have on the game, and once the players feel that what they do 
no longer matters, they’ll stop doing anything and the interactive 
aspect of interactive storytelling will fall by the wayside. 

All of this is starting to sound like a lot of work. Why, 
then, would anyone want to be a Storyteller? The answer is 
that Storytelling can be the most enjoyable part of the game. 
Creating something unique and sharing it with your players, 
seeing the looks in their eyes when they finally come face to 
face  with  the  big  reveal  you’ve  been  planning,  and  hearing 
them tell stories about what their characters did — all of these 
are magical, powerful moments that are unique to being the 
Storyteller.  And  with  it  comes  the  act  of  Storytelling  itself, 
the creation of the story that your players become part of and 
help craft with you — that’s the true reward of Storytelling, 
and one that’s worth all the time and energy that goes into it.

THE BIG CANVAS

One of the tools at your disposal in running a 
Wraith chronicle is the vast backlog of material 
that you can draw on. With a nod to continuity, 
you can bring in literally anyone or anything from 
history, because sooner or later, everything dies. 
Want to include Julius Caesar or Ada Lovelace 
in  your  game  as  characters?  You  can.  Need  to 
send the Circle chasing after a book burned with 
the Great Library of Alexandria or the original 
Amber Room, destroyed by an Allied bombing 
during World War II? That works, too. While the 
temptation is there to keep things tightly focused, 
remember that you have so much of history to 
use as a source for the people, places, and things 
you want to use to spice up your game. 

Wraith Storytelling Key Elements

or all the discussion of the theoretical and 
finer points of Storytelling, at the core of 
things,  the  role  of  Storyteller  is  a  simple 
one. To break things down to their simplest 
level, when play starts, the Storyteller sets 
the scene by describing the scenario to the 
players, and by acting out the roles of the 
characters in it that aren’t controlled by one of the players. The 
players, for their part, then improvise their way through the 
scenario, referencing their character sheets to identify the traits 
their characters may or may not have, and thus what they can 
or cannot do. The Storyteller in turn reacts, extending the story 
based on what the wraiths did (or did not do), and the cycle 
repeats. If one of the players wants to try an action that doesn’t 
fit smoothly and automatically into the flow of the story that’s 
being told, then the Storyteller resorts to the rules — and the 
player rolls dice — to determine if the attempt was a success or 
a failure. This continues until the end of the evening’s play, at 
which point the Storyteller hands out Experience Points as a 
reward, and players can spend them (or not) to improve their 
character’s capabilities.

And that, basically, is it. Everything else is details. 
But the nice part is that the details can be an awful lot of fun. 

Elements of Wraith

Most ghost stories follow a few standard patterns, the most 
important of which is that the ghosts are the antagonists and 
not the heroes. In Wraith, that gets turned on its head. The 
player characters are the ghosts, not the intrepid ghost hunt-
ers, and this does some interesting things to the format and 
structure of the classic ghost story. There are wonderful things 
to be done with the narrative of a Wraith chronicle, but they 
do  take  a  little  thought  above  and  beyond  jump  scares  and 
ghost hunting clichés.
Theme

All stories have themes, and ghost stories are no exception. 
It’s woven into the fabric of the tale. Wraith itself has a fair 
number of themes built into its DNA: horror, determination, 
loss, love, transcendence, the weight of history, and more, and 
any and all of these are at your disposal. You don’t have to ac-
tively work every single theme into every single game session; 
most will work themselves into the subtext of the game on their 
own, and it’s only to the ones that are particularly cogent that 
you’ll want to give special emphasis.

Once you figure out which theme you want to surface in 
your  chronicle,  there  are  a  variety  of  tactics  you  can  use  to 
bring it to players’ attention without going overboard. One of 
the easiest is to work it into the setting. If your theme is horror, 
filling  your  descriptions  with  unsettling  details  and  mysteri-

PROPS AND MUSIC

Sometimes, a little help can go a long way 
in setting the mood or inspiring a session. While 
not mandatory, background music can certainly 
help set the exact tone you want for an evening’s 
gameplay. There’s different ways to approach it 
— if a character has a Passion tied to a particular 
song, then working it into the playlist can serve 
as a thematic reminder. Old standards or classical 
music can reinforce the notion that the wraiths 
may  be  dealing  with  other  Restless  decades  or 
even  centuries  older  than  they  are.  And,  of 
course,  there’s  music  that’s  simply  intended  to 
set  a  tone.  It’s  often  best  to  refrain  from  using 
music  that’s  too  popular  or  that  has  lyrics  for 
this sort of thing, as either has the potential to 
distract players from the game and demand their 
attention. Movie and television soundtracks, in 
particular, can make for good mood music. After 
all, they were composed to provide background 
music for stories, and to emphasize the emotions 
that scenes were intended to inspire.

Props can also be useful for immersion. Hav-
ing something that can stand in for a sought-after 
Artifact or to represent a Fetter can bring a sense 
of tangible realism to the chronicle. Set dressing 
the gaming table to match a scene in the game 
can  heighten  the  immersion  of  the  moment. 
Even leaving items that reflect the theme of the 
game around the gaming space — and yes, there 
is more to life than skulls  — can get your players 
into the Wraith headspace faster than they might 
have otherwise.

ous scuttling noises in the background goes a long way. If it’s 
transcendence, play up the vertical lines of the architecture 
and places of pure light. The scuttling noises might turn out 
to be harmless roaches and the beams of light might be relic 
spotlights being tested in case of a Maelstrom, but the effect 
is what matters. 

Over the course of a chronicle, you may find yourself deal-
ing with multiple themes. This sort of variety is a good thing, 
providing a change of pace for the players, so long as you don’t 
overload things and try to use all the themes all the time. It’s a 
good idea to let the ones you choose — and you should choose 
not only to see which ones you like, but to see which ones work 
well together and provide good contrast — take turns in the 
spotlight, rising and falling in prominence based on the ups and 
downs of the chronicle. You may be heavily dialed in on that 
horror theme, but after a particularly intense gameplay moment, 
there’s much to be said for letting the horror rest and elevating 

something a little lighter in tone. With that in mind, some of 
the strongest themes to use in Wraith are:

Adventure: There’s a whole afterlife to explore, from the 
depths of the Labyrinth to the halls of Stygia’s libraries to the 
Far Shores. Many of the Restless Dead are driven by their Pas-
sions to seek out the same thrills they did in life, and they do 
this in various ways. Some explore, some go Doomslaying, and 
some make trouble for the living. In any case, the quest to do 
something new and exciting doesn’t die just because the flesh 
does, and the Underworld provides plenty of opportunities to 
indulge it.

Defiance:  The  mere  act  of  existing  as  a  wraith  defies 
Oblivion. Others turn their back on Stygia and rebel against it, 
or turn their entire afterlives into acts of defiance against the 
demands of their Shadows. Fighting the power — whatever that 
power might be perceived to be — can give a purpose to wraiths’ 
existences and strong thematic elements to your chronicle.

Fear: Even the dead have something to be afraid of. The 
Underworld is a terrifying and dangerous place. The characters 
are literal monsters, caught in a nightmare existence they never 
dreamed of. The living fear the dead, the dead fear Oblivion, 
and no one escapes fear’s grasp. Perhaps the characters spend 
their time fighting back against fear, taking the most terrifying 
elements of the Underworld on directly. Alternately, fear for 
others — for loved ones left in the Skinlands or fellow wraiths 
— can lead characters into alliances and conflicts they might 
otherwise have avoided. 

Immortality:  Wraiths  can,  barring  accident,  malice,  or 
the interference of Oblivion, go on indefinitely. What does it 
mean, then, to watch the centuries roll by and see your loved 
ones turned to dust? When the sturdiest Fetters have crumbled, 
why go on? Or you can turn it around and have the characters 
face those who are infinitely more acquainted with the costs 
and benefits of immortality than they are, ancient wraiths who 
have garnered deep understanding of what it costs to continue 
down through the slow centuries. 

Inner Conflict: A wraith’s worst enemy lives inside her 
head. Over the course of a chronicle, that inner conflict will 
manifest externally as Psyche and Shadow maneuver against 
each other. Will the wraith be able to withstand her other half’s 
blandishments and traps? Does the need for constant defiance 
sap her ability to deal with the other perils of the Underworld? 
What challenges does a Harrowing bring? And most of all, what 
effect does each wraith’s struggles have on her companions, all 
of whom are waging that same war within their minds?

Intrigue: Politics are eternal, and the Restless Dead have 
a great deal of time to kill. As a result, their dealings can be 
bizarrely byzantine, indulging in politics not only for power but 
also for their own sake. The web of intrigues, ancient conflicts, 
manipulative allies, and well-disguised enemies is enough to 
turn any wraith justifiably paranoid. A chronicle can play this 
up by trapping the Circle in a web of intrigue as various local 
Anacreons jockey for power within the Citadel, or it can be 

256

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

the story of centuries of plotting coming to fruition just as the 
wraiths arrive on the scene. 

Mystery: There’s a lot even the dead don’t know about 
death. Exploration of the Far Shores or setting sail in search of 
another Dark Kingdom, doing research into the nature of the 
Shadow in a Pardoner’s basement laboratory, trying to figure 
out what really happened to Charon — all of these are myster-
ies that have consumed wraiths over the centuries. Now it can 
be your Circle’s turn. Even the simple mystery of discovering 
the Underworld without a manual or guide offers all sorts of 
storytelling hooks, keeping the players guessing from moment 
to moment.

Triumph: Oblivion may feel inevitable, but there are still 
victories to be won across the Shroud. Maybe the players seek 
to wreck the foundries and end soulforging, or perhaps they just 
want to defend one mortal or one Necropolis. The victories they 
win stand as beacons against the Void, reminding all that some 
battles are still worth fighting, regardless of the odds.
Mood

If a chronicle’s theme is its underlying concept, then its 
mood is its underlying feel. The mood you create should match 
the emotions you wish your players to experience, bringing them 

into the story instead of just rolling dice and taking notes. Once 
you’ve established mood, they’ll more readily sustain it through 
roleplaying, and the entire system becomes self-supporting.

It’s useful to try to establish mood even before play starts. 
Lighting, music, props, and furnishings can all help project a 
mood, drawing a line between the workaday world and the world 
of the chronicle. Separating players from their smartphones 
and tablets keeps their focus on the game, as does restricting 
out-of-character speech to the strictly necessary. It’s up to you 
to figure out what’s appropriate and to use it to get your players 
on board with the game’s tone and intentions.

There are as many possible moods for a chronicle as there 
are possible chronicles. Some of the most powerful ones are:
Romantic: There is love beyond death — ask any wraith 
whose Passion burns for someone left behind in the Skinlands 
— and among wraiths love can truly be eternal. 

Ominous: Something is coming. Maybe it’s a Maelstrom, 
maybe  it’s  a  Legion  patrol,  maybe  it’s  a  line  of  Mourners. 
The details don’t matter. What does matter is the sense of 
impending doom.

Tragic: It’s one thing to worry about what’s coming. It’s 
another to know the outcome is foreordained and to stand 

STORYTELLING

257

against it anyway. On a certain level, this is every wraith’s 
story, with Oblivion the inescapable punchline, but the stand 
each  wraith  makes  against  the  inevitable  contains  its  own 
sad nobility.

Mysterious:  The  Underworld  is  shrouded  in  mystery. 
Not knowing may be half the fun, but when the unknown 
can destroy you for a single misstep, it creates a charged and 
deadly atmosphere. At the same time, the Underworld is full 
of discoveries — conspiracies to unravel, mysteries demand-
ing answers, blank spots on the metaphysical map that can 
still be filled in. 

Exciting: The raging seas of the Sea of Shadows, the thrills 
of fighting Spectres on the walls of a besieged Necropolis, the 
thrill of a heist in a hidden Guild hall — there’s plenty of 
excitement to be had even for the Restless Dead. And if the 
Circle’s Passions line up with this sort of thrill seeking, things 
can get very exciting indeed.

Lighthearted:  Being  dead  doesn’t  have  to  be  a  drag. 
Friendly  encounters,  pranking  the  living  and  to  hell  with 
the Dictum Mortuum, setting up a peace-and-love festival in 
downtown Stygia with a cast of Sandmen and Chanteurs — 
all of these are possibilities. The afterlife is too serious not to 
have fun with it every once in a while. The alternative is too 
grim to contemplate. 
The Big Three

Wraith has frequently been defined as a game of horror. 
However, fear, terror, and horror all have their place in the world 
of Wraith, and understanding their definitions and differences 
is key to using them effectively. They may be used interchange-
ably at times, but they are not the same.

Fear is the negative anxiety brought on by the anticipa-
tion of an unpleasant event. Fears can be directed at objects, 
peoples, places, and so on, and they can manifest in a variety 
of ways from rage to hopeless collapse, and pretty much every-
thing in between.

Many people actually enjoy a good jolt of fear. The jolt 
we get on roller coasters, watching horror movies, or sneaking 

THE BIG QUESTION

Can wraiths have sex?

In a word, yes. It goes without saying that 
Passion exists beyond the Shroud. And, when you 
consider things like Moliate and how a wraith’s 
Corpus is subconsciously defined by self-image, 
let’s just say that more than a few relic neckties 
have  been  metaphorically  hung  on  relic  door-
knobs over the centuries.

Pregnancy and childbirth, however, remain 

impossibilities.

through a haunted house is enjoyable because it’s in a safe space, 
and we can return to our everyday lives after receiving it without 
wondering if we’re going to make it. In Wraith, this translates 
into presenting threats that are real to the characters and real 
enough to thrill the players while still making the scene “safe” 
enough for everyone to enjoy the rush.

Terror is different than fear in that it demands action and 
allows hope. More of a visceral reaction than an intellectual 
one, it’s the response to the manifested threat and the reaction 
against it. More than anything else, terror contains the idea 
that both the fight and flight options are valid and possible. 
Terror might encourage a wraith to flee, but by doing so he 
has hope of escape. Terror might also inspire that same wraith 
to make a desperate attempt to fight back. As long as there’s 
no definitive evidence that any action is futile, the emotion 
inspired is not fear, it’s terror.

Horror is based on violation and hopelessness. It’s a gut 
reaction  to  the  intellectual  understanding  of  a  situation,  a 
physical response to reaching the boundary of what is safe and 
acceptable and obliterating that boundary. Anything from the 
unexpected sight of a drop of blood to the imminent arrival of 
a horde of spider demons can inspire horror. It all depends on 
what players consider safe, and how much it takes to destroy 
that concept of safety.

Violation  is  at  the  core  of  horror,  in  the  sense  that  the 
crossing of any boundary is a violation. This opens the door for 
horror to spring from the physical, the mental, and the emotional. 
The other side of the coin is the sense of finality intrinsic 
to horror. If fear is the thought of the monster in the house, 
and terror is the moment it charges down the hall, horror is the 
moment a second later when you discover your feet are glued 
to the spot and you can only helplessly await the inevitable 
denouement.

Use of one of these does not preclude the use of the oth-
ers, and they can work well in concert. Just remember to be 
aware of which one you’re using, and of the consequences of 
doing the same. 

Storytelling Tools

s  a  Storyteller,  you  have  a  series  of  tools 
in  your  arsenal  that  you  can  use  to  drive 
and  direct  your  chronicle.  The  two  most 
prominent  are  events  and  character,  and 
how you apply those shapes the structure 
and content of your game.

An important thing to remember is that 
you have carte blanche to do whatever you see fit in the game. 
Need to add a character to provide the Circle with a vital clue 
they’ve failed to pick up on their own? You can do it. Need to 
spring a surprise ambush by a bunch of desperate Renegades 
because the characters are dilly-dallying around and they need to 
start moving in some direction? Go right ahead. The authority 

258

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

of the Storyteller to add, subtract, or reorder the world of the 
chronicle is absolute, and when put to good use, that authority 
makes the game more enjoyable for everyone. While serving as 
Storyteller, you should never be afraid to bring a new element 
in (or strip an old element out) in a way that fits seamlessly 
with the rest of the chronicle. Real life doesn’t get edited for 
pacing and content, but the world you’re Storytelling is under 
no such restrictions. 

Events

Events make up the meat of what actually “happens” in a 
chronicle. Fights with packs of ravening Spectres, a suspicious 
Legionnaire  suddenly  bursting  into  pursuit,  a  coincidental 
meeting with the very wraith a character needs to meet — all 
of these are the sorts of events that make for key moments. As 
the Storyteller, you have the power to make literally anything 
happen in the world. But that doesn’t always mean you should 
reach for the biggest hammer in your toolbox without checking 
first to see if a little tap will suffice.

When  planning  your  chronicle,  it’s  a  good  idea  to  map 
out the key events that outline the arc of the story. Victories, 
defeats, betrayals, meetings, surprise revelations — all of these 
can serve as significant events in a chronicle’s life, diverting or 
reinforcing the flow of the narrative to best effect. 

That doesn’t mean, however, that you have to stick with 
your pre-planned sequence of events. Sometimes the players’ 
actions make it abundantly clear that the tidy schedule of key 
moments you, as Storyteller, arranged is no longer viable, typi-
cally by running off in a completely different direction than the 
one you’ve planned. At that point, slavish devotion to “what 
happens next” means trying to force the players back onto the 
primrose path, and that can provoke resistance and a failure 
to suspend disbelief. 
Purpose

In a Wraith chronicle, everything happens for a reason, 
and you get to determine what that reason is. That’s another 
way of saying that every encounter you build into your storyline 
should be there for a reason. Meeting a furtive Solicitor may 
feel like a random encounter to the players’ Circle, but as Sto-
ryteller you should have a reason for those particular paths to 
cross. Maybe it’s a setup for one of the Circle wraiths learning 
Intimation down the road. Maybe someone’s intent on fram-
ing the Circle and having them associated with a member of 
a banned Guild is evidence that will damn them to the forges. 
Maybe the Solicitor set up the “accidental” meeting as the first 
step toward ensnaring the Circle in a complicated scheme. Or 
maybe you’re laying a trail for the Circle to follow as they are 
given the chance to pursue this practitioner of outlawed arts. 
Alternately, the purpose can be strictly structural. Drop-
ping in a brief fight with a lone (and lost) Spectre as the Circle 
traverses a normally safe Byway can be a low-risk way for wraiths 
to blow off some steam after a couple of talk-heavy game ses-
sions. Dropping a character down a Nihil can be an effective 

way to keep someone out of the way while their player is absent 
for a gaming session, even as the other characters react to her 
disappearance with shock and dismay, or even resolutions to 
go looking for her. Having a bedraggled Circle get picked up 
by a Ferryman for a ride down the Great River can be a way 
of boosting the spirits (and firepower) of a group that’s been 
unlucky, and giving it some wins at a time when things don’t 
seem to be going well. And bringing a monstrous plasmic out 
of the Tempest for some monster-fighting action can be a useful 
change of pace if your players are worn down from a frenzied 
bout of Stygian politicking. The trick is being clear-eyed about 
the purpose the events in your chronicle serve, whether they 
be narrative-driven or purely tonal or structural.
Scope and Scale

You  should  always  tailor  the  things  you  drop  into  your 
chronicle to the characters’ current state and capabilities. It 
doesn’t  matter  if  your  schedule  calls  for  the  Circle  to  come 
face to face with a viciously potent Mortwight with an army 
of  Stripling  followers  at  their  next  session;  if  the  characters 
are beaten down or beaten up, the fight will be brief, bloody, 
and disappointing. Instead, power the enemy down to make it 
one the characters feel they can win, and let them enjoy the 
moment. Alternately, make it painfully clear that the wraiths 
cannot win against so powerful a foe and set up a retreat so 
that they might fight another day. Conversely, if the wraiths 
of the Circle are at full strength, packing powerful Artifacts 
that they’ve pillaged from a Deathlord’s private collection, it 
makes perfect sense to up the strength of an adversary enough 
to provide a challenge. If a fight’s ending too quickly, you can 
always send more reinforcements into the room on whichever 
side needs them. You should not be ashamed of Storytelling 
reactively to the state of your chronicle. It’s far worse to stick 
doggedly to a plot point that’s no longer germane or fair to the 
actual chronicle you’re running.

Bear in mind that not every fight is meant to be fair. Send-
ing the Circle packing to demonstrate how powerful a foe is 
can  teach  a  valuable  lesson  and  set  up  a  long-term  nemesis 
character in one shot. A series of too-easy wins, whether on the 
battlefield or the council chamber, can generate overconfidence 
and set up a sudden reversal. And there’s always a perfect mo-
ment for a supposed ally to go turncoat and change the odds, 
putting the Circle at a sudden and unexpected disadvantage. 
That’s not to say that every encounter needs to be one-sided 
one way or another, merely that overly generous or dangerous 
moments have their place in inspiring roleplaying and driving 
future action.
Pacing

Pacing is the speed at which various elements of the chronicle 
occur in sequence. The closer together those events occur, the 
faster the pacing is said to be, and hyper-fast pacing isn’t always 
the best bet for a mood-intensive game like Wraith. Giving the 
Circle space in between moments to rest, recover, discuss, and 

STORYTELLING

259

plan can be useful, while rushing events in a neverending array 
can feel about as satisfying from drinking from a fire hose. 

For example, having the Circle decide they need to find a 
Pardoner for a friend who’s on the verge of Catharsis and then 
bumping into one immediately is a prime example of poor pacing. 
The events — the discovery of the character’s need and the dis-
covery of the Pardoner — happen too close together, and without 
building. It could be much better to let the search for the Pardoner 
drag out, creating tension and worry. Alternately, you could follow 
up the meeting with the Pardoner with another slam-bang incident 
— say, the discovery that the Pardoner owes something to the lo-
cal Spooks collective and the price of his helping the Circle with 
their problem is them helping him with his — providing a quick 
reversal on the heels of the obvious and easy reveal. 

Leaving space between key events is also key to encourag-
ing roleplaying. Leaving the characters to their own devices to 
plot and plan rather than feeding them event after event in a 
steady stream allows them to make their own fun. It gives them 
time to develop their relationships with the rest of the Circle 
or advance the plot in their own way, rather than reflexively 
reacting to the latest obstacle you’ve thrown at them. In addi-
tion, it grants time for the implications of an event to sink in. 
Letting the Circle know that the Anacreon whose office they 
burgled sicced a pack of barghests on them should inspire dread. 

Waiting to bring the barghests onto the scene gives time for the 
characters’ dread to rise up, deepening the tone of the session 
and building anticipation. Then, introducing the barghests as 
a faint sound of howls off in the distance can drive action as 
the wraiths panic or prepare, as anticipation rises. Eventually 
the barghests will have to appear onstage, but by delaying their 
arrival you’ve made them more imposing antagonists.  

Similarly, leaving time for players to appreciate the setting 
can be highly beneficial. Whether it’s a wraith returning to her 
burned-out childhood home after the loss of it as a Fetter or 
the high strangeness of the corridors of the Labyrinth, giving 
the characters time to reflect on their surroundings instead of 
simply fast-forwarding to the next big set piece can yield big 
rewards, emotionally speaking. 

That doesn’t mean all events need to be doled out at a 
miserly pace. Hitting the Circle with a series of hammer blows 
—  a  beloved  patron  arrested,  allies  slamming  doors  in  their 
faces  without  explanation,  word  on  the  streets  that  they’re 
being hunted and the destruction of a communal Haunt — is 
a highly effective way to raise the emotional stakes and up the 
urgency of a chronicle. It’s just not something you can go to 
every time. Varying pace — speeding up and slowing down in 
turn — is the best way to avoid falling into a routine and hav-
ing your story beats feel predictable.

Storyteller Characters

The other major weapon in your arsenal is the array of 
characters you can portray. As a Storyteller, you populate the 
entire world apart from the player characters, from bit players 
the Circle passes in the street and random wraiths yelling out 
windows to beloved family members and Fetters, loyal allies, 
ancient  and  powerful  patrons,  and  implacable  antagonists. 
Wielded  deftly,  they  can  have  an  enormous  impact  on  the 
player experience. 

Every character in the world should have a valid reason 
for being there and, ideally, motivation behind their actions. 
Even if the character is “wraith the Circle bumps into while 
walking  down  the  street  in  Stygia”  and  the  purpose  of  the 
character  is  “demonstrate  that  the  street,  and  by  extension, 
Stygia, is crowded,” there’s a rationale for the wraith being there 
that grounds the character in the scene. Not every character 
requires a full character sheet and power distribution, as many 
will simply disappear off the stage after saying their one line or 
having their one moment. But due to the nature of roleplaying, 
even the most minor character has the potential to blossom into 
something more — say, if the Circle takes a sudden interest in 
the Stygian wraith they just bumped into on the street — and 
giving characters basic motivations and identifiable traits goes 
a long way toward preparing for this possibility.

More  robust  characters  have  a  greater  impact  on  the 
chronicle and thus can require more attention. If one member 
of the Circle has an Ally, knowing who that Ally is, why she 
supports the wraith, what she’s capable of, and where she can 
be found means that you’re ready to slip into that role any time 
the Circle feels the need to call on her. The same goes for all 
Storyteller characters the players are liable to interact with, from 
the stern Centurion who repeatedly warns them about their loose 
interpretation of Stygian law to the kindly mentor who brooks 
no tomfoolery when trying to instruct a wraith in the arts of his 
Arcanos  to  the  Shadow-Eaten  former  friend  who  now  hunts 
the Circle relentlessly, hoping to drag them down to Oblivion.
Something  to  bear  in  mind  when  creating  Storyteller 
characters is that you have virtually all of human history to play 
with. If all of the wraiths in your chronicle are from Jefferson 
City, Missouri, there’s no reason to have all of the wraiths they 
interact with be from there as well. You can add new color and 
tone, as well as new perspectives, to your game by adding wraiths 
from the American Revolution, 15th-century Prague, Berkeley 
in the Summer of Love and Blitz-era London. Going deep with 
your character choices gives you the chance to rationalize pretty 
much any experience or knowledge your cast might have, and 
introduces variety into the world. 
Friends and Allies

Characters who support one or more wraiths in the Circle 
make the game world richer. Having them out there gives the 
characters a place to go if they need help or a place to hide, of-
fers you ways to direct the chronicle by doling out information 

IT’S OKAY TO CHEAT SOMETIMES

As  noted  above,  it’s  often  a  fruitless  effort 
to stat out every character the players are likely 
to interact with for even a moment or two. Un-
fortunately,  it’s  all  too  possible  for  one  of  the 
characters to randomly decide to pick a fight with 
the anonymous sailor he just bumped into, or for 
one of the Circle wraiths to do something publicly 
stupid in a way that starts a stampede or a riot. 

At moments like that, not having the exact 
stats for the wraith one of the Circle members 
just hit with the Stygian equivalent of a bar stool 
can make Storytelling the action sequence more 
difficult. But in cases where the important thing 
is not the specific combat but rather the context 
— the fight with the random wraith might be a 
brief  distraction,  the  emergence  of  the  rioting 
crowd  could  provide  cover  for  a  daring  group 
escape – it makes perfect sense to improvise the 
stats of the random wraith on the other end of 
the metaphorical bar stool rather than painstak-
ingly spread dots around. It’s even permissible to 
throw the fight, if your narrative dictates that the 
player not get hauled off by Reapers for ransom, 
and instead provide the player with a smashing 
win.  Letting  the  results  of  a  random  number 
generator or the need to calculate Arcanoi for a 
one-shot Storyteller character dictate the pace 
of your chronicle is putting the cart well before 
the horse. If “cheating” is what it takes for you 
to achieve the desired result, then by all means, 
cheat on your players’ behalf.

This isn’t license to cheat all the time, but 
the wise Storyteller understands that sometimes 
everyone needs a bit of a push to get over the hump. 

or advice, and makes the world feel bigger. Each one of these 
characters,  whether  they’re  derived  from  a  Circle  member’s 
character sheet or not, needs to have a background and a history 
with one or more Circle wraiths. There has to be a reason to 
help the Circle or its members, and knowing that reason gives 
you greater leeway in your roleplaying with the player characters. 
Furthermore, friendly characters need to provide something 
the Circle lacks. Maybe it’s knowledge of an Arcanos or the local 
political scene. Maybe it’s access to oboli or a stash of working 
relic firearms. Maybe it’s muscle, or a particular Artifact the 
wraith is willing to lend out judiciously. On a basic level, this is 
why these characters are in the wraiths’ lives, and understand-
ing what they bring to the table can prevent wild goose chases 
and player frustration.

Antagonists

Antagonists are the carriers of external conflict. Their actions and 
the threat they represent actualize the unspoken conflict of the game, 
and picking the right antagonist for your chronicle can go a long way 
toward  making  it  a  success.  Match  wraiths  against  an  antagonist  too 
big for them and they’ll fail. Line them up against someone who’s not 
powerful  enough  and  they’ll  breeze  through  climactic  showdowns  and 
get bored in the process. 

There’s also the question of choosing thematically appropriate ad-
versaries. If a chronicle focuses on lost love and romance, adding a horde 
of ravening Shades and a Nephwrack who’s into extreme sports might 
not be the best aesthetic choice. A good antagonist ties into the theme 
of the chronicle and enhances it through opposition. A bad one merely 
exists to get in the way.

Antagonists are characters in the chronicle as well, and the best ones 
are treated as such. To make them truly engaging, they need the same things 
player characters need — goals and aspirations. An antagonist who doesn’t 
want something can’t hope to evoke emotion from a player, or satisfaction 
when beaten. Conversely, an antagonist with a well-defined set of goals, 
even if those goals are as clean and basic as “destroy the player character 
for revenge,” lends direction to their actions and serves as a skeleton for 
their plotlines. Antagonists can change their goals over time, learn from 
their mistakes, and adapt their tactics. They have growth curves as surely 
as player characters do, and if they remain static they become progressively 
less interesting and inappropriate.

Scaling antagonists can be a delicate business. It’s not inappropriate 
to be deliberately vague about an opponent’s capabilities (and character 
sheet) on a first encounter; moving some points around (or adding or 
subtracting) to make the antagonist a better match for how the Circle 
reacted to her is a time-honored technique. Another approach is to cre-
ate sub-antagonists. If the villain of the piece is a powerful general of the 
Skeletal Legion, it can make very little sense for her to be dealing with 
the Circle herself. She must have subordinates, adjutants, and the like 
willing to follow her orders, and these other wraiths (who also have their 
own motivations) can be closer in power level to the protagonists. 

The best antagonists, like the best allies, offer something the Circle 
lacks. They are defined in large part by that opposition to the wraiths who 
comprise the Circle, and that difference can be key to their interaction. 
And so an excellent possible antagonist for a bunch of wisecracking young 
wraiths is a stodgy, ancient Grim Legionnaire who has no time or patience 
for their disorder. If the Circle is overly cerebral, a barely sentient and 
deeply ravenous Shade might make for a good fit. It’s also possible that 
the difference is something smaller — the favor of a Deathlord extended 
to the Circle and denied to their nemesis, or Passions in direct opposition 
related to a shared Fetter. 

It’s also useful to give antagonists a distinctive trait and voice of their 
own. Otherwise, you risk having them drown in a sea of sameness, and 
having players get blasé about the endless parade of similar-looking and 
-sounding threats. That doesn’t mean that you should turn your antago-
nists into cartoons, but rather that they should all have distinguishing and 
recognizable features that allow them to stand out — and to potentially 
frighten the characters by their merest expression. A monomaniacal Reaper 
who whistles out of tune, a corrupted Pauper bureaucrat who never uses

CHARACTER VOICE VERSUS CHARACTER ACCENT
One of the seemingly easiest ways to give a 
character a unique presence is to give them an 
accent. This can backfire, though — most accents 
are hard to do well and can come out sounding 
cartoony or repetitive. More difficult, but more 
rewarding, can be to give them a unique voice 
instead. Giving a character a very specific diction 
and syntax, on the other hand, can serve the same 
function while feeling more organic and real. The 
contrast between two Legionnaires, one of whom 
only speaks in short, precise sentences and the 
other of whom regularly launches long-winded di-
gressions with the phrase “You want to know what 
I think?” is easily and intuitively understood. And 
giving each character distinctive voice elements 
instead of shared accents goes a long way toward 
helping define the character — as a role to play 
and as an entity in the players’ minds — as well.

contractions when he’s speaking, a self-absorbed Doomslayer 
who’s decided that one of the Circle members is a Doppelganger 
and who’s known for his axe work — these are quick and easy 
signifiers that make antagonists instantly identifiable as unique. 
And once you demonstrate that these unique antagonists are 
also dangerous ones, their particular traits become additional 
storytelling tools in your hands.

Setting

Where your chronicle is set can go a long way in helping 
you identify much of what’s going to go into it. Setting defines 
who the Circle is likely to run into, what sorts of adventures 
they’re likely to have, and what sorts of resources they’re going 
to have to work with. A game set in Stygia is a lot more likely 
to feature ancient and powerful wraiths and their agents, and 
to have a significant intrigue factor as a result, than a game set 
in the Necropolis of a dying industrial city in the American 
Rust  Belt.  That  game,  on  the  other  hand,  is  likely  to  have 
much  more  emphasis  on  dealing  with  the  Skinlands  and  its 
inhabitants, and the wraiths the Circle encounters are likely to 
be younger and less powerful than their Stygian counterparts. 
Chronicles  centered  on  Helldiving  deep  into  the  Labyrinth 
are more likely to have a mood of high strangeness and horror, 
and to feature Spectres as adversaries than ones set on board 
the  Midnight  Express.  When  you  pick  a  setting,  you’re  also 
picking everything that goes with it, and all the resources and 
limitations that implies. 

Which means that you should be careful to select a base 
setting that supports what you want to do with the chronicle. 
If you’ve decided ahead of time that you want the focus of the 
game to be horror, then you’ll want a setting where that horror 

can exist naturally and which supports that mood. A desolate 
Necropolis or the corridors of the Labyrinth, then, make better 
choices as a setting for that chronicle than do the brightly lit 
halls of power or a swashbuckling vessel exploring the Sea of 
Shadows. Architecture, lighting, and state of repair — all of 
these go into building the world of your campaign. 

Similarly, the setting you choose should support the sorts 
of characters with whom you want to populate your chronicle. 
Even the lowliest dive bar in Stygia isn’t going to be home to 
a crew of hard-bitten Reapers, mainly because there’s no reap-
ing to be done in Stygia. Ancient wraiths from the days of the 
Roman Empire are highly unlikely to be found lurking in the 

STAYING TOGETHER

Keeping  all  the  characters  in  a  Wraith 
chronicle together can be difficult. They can be 
separated  by  Harrowings,  Maelstroms,  the  use 
of Arcanoi, or the simple pressures of the world, 
and  separated  members  of  a  Circle  inevitably 
means  taking  turns  regarding  which  faction  of 
the Circle you’re going to deal with at a given 
moment. The more the entire Circle is together, 
the more the characters bond, the tighter knit the 
group becomes, and the more they can do when 
unified as a team. Also, the more the entire squad 
is together, the less time any given player spends 
sitting on the sidelines waiting for his turn. 

To  a  degree,  Shadowguiding  mitigates  this 
concern, as idle players can take up the roles of 
Shadows of their active friends. But making an 
effort to keep the group together can pay off in 
tighter  scenes  and  cause  less  wear  and  tear  on 
a Storyteller who might otherwise be forced to 
juggle five distinct plotlines, each with their own 
casts of characters and minutiae every session. 

Basic  techniques  for  keeping  the  wraiths 
of a chronicle together can involve something 
as simple as brute force — Nihils miraculously 
dumping lost characters out near their friends, 
or Legionnaires capturing them all and bringing 
them together as prisoners. More delicate tech-
niques can involve a shared powerful enemy; this 
incentivizes the wraiths who might otherwise have 
gotten picked off one by one to stay together. And 
those who wish to weave this sort of togetherness 
deep into the fabric of their chronicle can go back 
to character creation. Shared Fetters can bring 
distant  wraiths  together,  particularly  if  one  is 
threatened. Shared histories or acquaintances and 
affiliations are huge for giving characters excuses 
to remain involved with one another.

local Citadel; they’ve got bigger fish to fry elsewhere, and odds 
are their Fetters are long gone, preventing them from traveling 
to the Shadowlands for long in any case. If you want to use 
characters of a certain type, then your setting should allow a 
good reason for those characters to be there.

You  should  also  think  about  the  links  your  characters 
might have to the setting. If the entire Circle shares an origin 
of dying in a bus crash in Los Angeles, then Los Angeles is a 
natural choice for the chronicle’s setting. If everyone’s character 
is a Renegade, shouting defiance at the ancient empire of the 
dead, then Stygia’s a less likely place to set them down to start 
with. The characters may end up there, but initially, at least, a 
smaller Necropolis or a hideout in the Shadowlands is a better 
fit. If characters have Allies or Mentors, then making sure the 
setting provides for them is a must, and if a character concept 
is  a  sailor  or  pirate,  you  may  wish  to  consider  a  shipyard,  a 
floating haunt, or the Sea of Shadows as good places to kick 
off the action.

Conflict

All stories ultimately revolve around conflict. Someone 
wants  something,  someone  tries  to  get  something,  and  they 
do  or  don’t  succeed,  depending  on  their  own  attributes  and 
the things that stand in the way of that desire. Sometimes the 
conflict is internal, sometimes it’s external, and in the cases of a 
complicated narrative like a Wraith chronicle, it could be both. 
Identifying  the  conflicts  that  are  intrinsic  to  your  chronicle 

and  working  directly  with  them  to  heighten  tension,  create 
obstacles for characters, and define character relationships is 
key to successful storytelling.

At its most basic level, conflict is what drives the action 
of the chronicle. Conflicting desires come into opposition, and 
the moment of collision of these wants is the conflict. This in 
turn sparks character reactions to this opposition, generating 
the meat of the story. 

There’s  no  shortage  of  potential  adversaries  to  generate 
conflict with in Wraith. Other Restless Dead — Renegades, 
Heretics,  Hierarchs,  members  of  rival  Guilds  or  Legions,  or 
the relentless soldiers of the Unlidded Eye can all serve as the 
authors of conflict within a chronicle, but they’re far from the 
only ones. Spectres provide an obvious nemesis, as do plasmics 
(for strictly physical confrontations), while conflicts with the 
Quick can be dangerous to vulnerable Fetters. Shadows, mean-
while, provide internal conflict, giving voice to a character’s 
deepest fears and desires and saying the things the wraith can’t 
bring herself to say. 

Ideally,  conflicts  have  resolutions.  A  foe  is  vanquished, 
or  an  object  of  desire  is  obtained  (or  placed  forever  out  of 
reach). Any resolution to a conflict, big or small, should feel 
appropriate to the debate it’s wrapping up. Nemeses who have 
been bedeviling a Circle for months shouldn’t get whisked off 
in a two-turn fight; minor disagreements between Circlemates 
shouldn’t result in one of them headed to the forges. Making 
sure the resolution matches the conflict’s tone and scope is one 

264

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

of the key elements of storytelling, and a failure to stick the 
landing on a resolution can undo much of the good work that 
went into a storyline.

Resolutions don’t have to be permanent, nor do they mean 
a new conflict can’t arise. A wraith who is humiliated by an 
opponent can swear vengeance and restart the conflict as soon 
as he is able. A wraith may win a temporary battle with her 
Shadow, but tomorrow it’s still going to get another crack at 
taking over via Catharsis. Alliances can fall apart, promises can 
fail and oaths be broken. Alternately, defeating an opponent isn’t 
just defeating an opponent. If the downed nemesis had friends, 
allies, or loved ones, it may be that taking out a rival is just the 
start of a longer vendetta. Coming to an accommodation with 
a local Anacreon may mean making an enemy of that wraith’s 
rival. The possibilities are endless. 

Bear in mind that not every conflict automatically maps to 
full on tooth-and-nail combat. Sometimes conflict can be over 
the right way to achieve a goal, or it could be a wraith trying 
to prevent a friend or loved one from going down a dangerous 
path. Scaling the level of conflict appropriately is as important 
to a good chronicle as identifying the right conflicts to play up. 
Having a high-ranking Hierarch place roadblocks in front of 
the players’ Circle is one thing; having that same wraith relent-
lessly hound them at every moment simply because he can is 
another,  far  less  productive  one.  Similarly,  conflict  between 
members of a Circle over what approach to take can be friendly 
and constructive, and a wise Storyteller lets the players handle 
that on their own instead of working to fan the flames of even 
the smallest disagreement. While there are times when ramping 
up the conflict is the right thing to do for a chronicle, knowing 
how to tune it up or down as necessary goes a long way toward 
keeping things emotionally true.

Some of the conflicts key to Wraith are:
Wraith  vs.  Hierarchy  —  This  works  even  if  a  wraith 
identifies as a law-abiding citizen of Stygia. Political squabbles 
between Legions put many in the crosshairs of rivals before they 
know it. Alternately, a violation of the Dictum Mortuum — or 
a  single  misstep  in  the  view  of  a  vengeful  opponent  —  can 
lead to the entire bureaucratic weight of the empire crashing 
down on a character. 

Wraith vs. Renegades — Renegade wraiths have no love for 
those bound by the laws of Stygia. Trying to bring a dangerous 
Renegade to justice (or injustice, as the court system in Stygia 
has some deeply bad apples in it) can earn a wraith a lot of 
enemies who don’t play by the rules. Having a wraith pursued 
by  an  entire  Renegade  gang  can  offer  plenty  of  excitement; 
getting caught in the middle of a war between two Renegade 
gangs is more than most wraiths can handle. 

Wraith vs. Heretics — Running afoul of a fanatical cult 
— whether they be Nhudri worshippers or recently deceased 
who view themselves as religiously obligated to help their fellow 
wraiths into the next life by bludgeoning them into Harrowings 
at regular intervals — can be very dangerous indeed. If the wraith 

foils a Heretic cult’s plans, she has just acquired a fanatical set 
of enemies, ones who believe that divine right is on their side.
Wraith vs. Guild — While Guilds aren’t persecuted with 
the ferocity of yesteryear, they’re still officially illegal in Stygia. 
They’re  also,  by  and  large,  secretive  and  paranoid.  Blowing 
open a Guild’s cache of secrets or opposing a Guild’s plan can 
produce legions of disciples of a particular Arcanos putting the 
wraith in their crosshairs, and most Guilds have adherents and 
allies everywhere.

Wraith vs. Legion — In theory, every wraith belongs to a 
Legion. Some wraiths are better about this responsibility than 
others, and some Legionnaires take brighter or dimmer views 
of  this  approach.  Freshly  Reaped  members  of  a  Legion  who 
annoy a superior may be signing themselves up for lifetimes 
of bureaucratic hurt, or political rivals within a given Legion 
may attempt to sandbag one member of the group. Even if the 
wraith is on perfect terms with every other member of his Le-
gion, there’s still all the others to worry about, and the rivalry 
between Factions can be murderous.

Wraith vs. Circle — Conflict within a wraith’s Circle is 
practically a given. No two people, living or dead, are going to 
agree on absolutely everything. Even the closest of friends are 
going to find themselves at each other’s throat at some point, 
particularly when they have all eternity to hang out and their 
Shadows egging them on. Alternately, a real conflict may arise 
when a Circle is torn on what to do. If one member of the group 
wants to become Risen and some of the others don’t wish to 
support her on this dangerous quest, it could tear the Circle 
apart. If a Circle of Renegades receives an offer of amnesty from 
the local representative of a Deathlord, there could be furious 
debate — or worse — between wraiths who want to take the 
offer and others who feel it’s a trap. As long as the conflict isn’t 
allowed to burn too hot or too constantly, jagged edges within 
a Circle can spark spectacular roleplaying.

Wraith  vs.  Spectres  —  The  most  basic  conflict  of  the 
Underworld, the endless struggle between light and dark fuels 
many Chronicles. The conflict here can be as simple as Spectres 
wanting into a citadel during a Maelstrom while the wraith 
wants to keep them out. Or, it could be as complicated as a 
specific Spectre who knew the wraith before getting Shadow-
Eaten deciding to target his old friend to be dragged down to 
Oblivion. Spectres can be as direct and brutal or as patient and 
subtle as needed, and the ally they have in a wraith’s Shadow 
can make the fight a deeply unfair one.

Wraith vs. Quick — Mortals and ghosts don’t always get 
along. When the activities of the living threaten the needs — or 
the Fetters — of the Restless, the conflict can blaze in defiance 
of the Dictum Mortuum. Human ghost hunters can annoy or 
endanger wraiths, while wraiths can target individual mortals for 
destruction in order to feed Passions of vengeance. The Shroud 
may keep the two sides apart, but there’s plenty of conflict to 
be had between the living and the dead.

STORYTELLING

265

Wraith vs. Other Supernatural Creatures — Wraiths can have 
complicated relationships with the other hidden powers of the world. Some 
wraiths have vampires as Fetters, on the grounds that they’re theoretically 
immortal, while others have spent centuries tracking down the particular 
Cainite who killed them in hopes of extracting revenge. Werewolves, 
mages, and other supernatural creatures also have their particular uses for 
and misunderstandings of wraiths, and even simple misunderstandings 
between supernatural beings can quickly flare into conflict.

Wraith  vs.  Shadow  —  The  conflict  between  a  wraith  and 
her Shadow is constant and endless. The Psyche seeks to build the 
wraith up and endure while the Shadow looks to tear all of that 
down. As the wraith progresses, her Shadow uses every tool in its 
arsenal, from confidence-sapping whispers to diabolical Thorns to 
the overwhelming brute force of Catharsis, to bring the wraith down. 
Wraith vs. Self — Extended verbal combat with the Shadow 
isn’t the only form of internal conflict a wraith can engage in. The 
simple act of introspection can set a wraith against himself, causing 
him to question his decisions or the morality of his actions. A wraith 
torn between two incompatible Passions may find himself on the 
brink of breaking down or worse, succumbing to the Shadow, as the 
relentless toll he places on himself is counted out. 

Chronicles

s noted earlier, a chronicle is an ongoing Wraith game 
featuring a core narrative arc. If the individual sessions 
are chapters, then the chronicle is the book they form 
together.  By  expanding  the  scope  of  the  narrative 
beyond a single session, the chronicle opens up the 
possibilities of longer storylines, bigger casts, and a 
larger scale for the adventures the characters undertake. 
A chronicle also brings continuity to the table. A one-shot villain 
is a nice thing to have, but an extended chronicle lets you bring in 
his employer, his friends, his Guild, the reason he was hired, other 
enemies he might have made, and much more. In other words, the 
chronicle form gives you a bigger canvas to paint on, and numerous 
ways to take advantage of that extra space.
Getting Started

Every chronicle has to start somewhere, and the best place to 
start is with a basic idea of what kind of story you want to tell. This 
should be in place before your players start on character creation, 
so you can guide them in making sure the characters they cook up 
fit your concept for the chronicle as a whole. 

Since the World of Darkness is a dark, twisted mirror of our 
own, you can pull chronicle ideas from anywhere around you. Cast 
your net wide for inspiration — the latest political shenanigans, 
historical figures you think would be fun to interact with, places you 
think would be interesting to explore — all of these are fair game.
The basics you need for your chronicle are simple: Who’s in-
volved, where does it happen, and where does it take the characters? 
The first question should get you thinking about the Storyteller 
characters you’ll be portraying, particularly the ones the Circle will 

266

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

be going up against. Knowing how they’ll react to the characters 
and what they’re after will go a long way toward helping you 
make them feel fully realized.

Where the chronicle happens is also key, as noted previously 
in the Setting section. Pinpointing the place you want at the 
heart of the chronicle helps describe the action. For example, 
there won’t be much crossing the Shroud if the action’s on the 
Isle of Sorrows. At the same time, knowing where you want to 
set things helps you with your research into local landmarks 
and figures of renown you can add into the mix. If you’re setting 
your chronicle in the Paris Necropolis, then thinking about 
the Catacombs and Pere Lachaise Cemetery is a natural next 
step. This in turn will help you place the key moments of your 
chronicle in locations that are interesting and appropriate.

Finally, there’s the question of where it takes the characters. 
You should have an end in mind at the beginning, even if it’s 
only a rough one. Every action has consequences, every villain 
has allies or friends, and no good deed goes unpunished. Even 
if you’re only planning to play Wraith with these characters 
once, laying groundwork for potential future sessions can help 
you focus on what you want to happen during the first one.

Speaking of which, it’s a good idea to know roughly how 
long you want the chronicle to go. Sometimes a one-shot game 
is the best way to go, but often everyone involved wants an 
ongoing chronicle. A longer chronicle has the advantage of long-
term continuity, as well as access to the continually expanding 
base of background material — locations, characters, and so 
forth — that has been developed as you go along. This wealth 
of material fleshes out the world, making it feel like it exists 
beyond whatever the Circle is doing at the moment, and gives 
you more margin for error as a Storyteller in case the players 
decide to leave the main plot behind. On the other hand, all 
that continuity has to be kept track of, lest inconsistencies creep 
in and manifest at the worst possible time. Still, the benefits 
of the larger chronicle setting outweigh the drawbacks by far.
Direction

Another key question to consider is whether the chronicle 
will be plot-driven or character-driven. Each approach offers 
advantages and disadvantages, and each can produce a memo-
rable Wraith chronicle. 

Plot-driven Chronicles tend to be linear, with a stated goal 
at the beginning and a clear resolution (“Defeat the Spectre 
who masterminded the attack on your home Necropolis”) at 
the end. That requires some up-front work to map the prob-
able route of the chronicle, as the story largely revolves around 
how the Circle deals with their enemies’ plots. Story-driven 
Chronicles are relatively simple to run, as you don’t have to rely 
on the players to advance the plot when you’ve got villainous 
Storyteller characters ready to do it whenever you need them. 
If the Circle waits, their enemies just get stronger.

Character-driven games are more difficult, as they lack the 
simple throughput of a plot-driven narrative. While there is an 
ultimate goal to be reached — Transcendence, becoming Risen 

and dealing with something back in the Skinlands, rising in 
the ranks of the Hierarchy or simply growing as a wraith — the 
path to that goal is much more nebulous, and the direction the 
chronicle takes is driven by what makes sense for the characters 
to do. Passions and Fetters serve as good guidelines for what 
might motivate characters; experienced roleplayers will pick 
these  up  and  run  with  them,  while  beginners  might  require 
the impetus of an existential threat to a beloved Fetter to get 
moving. Storyteller characters, particularly those allied to the 
Circle, can also help propel the wraiths forward. If they materi-
ally benefit from what the Circle does, it drives the narrative 
and makes character sense.

Once  the  characters  are  moving  in  the  right  direction, 
you need to throw a few obstacles in their way. Encounters, 
rough terrain or Maelstroms, Spectre attacks, or the lack of a 
crucial piece of knowledge all serve as obstacles for the Circle 
to overcome. The main drawback to character-driven plots is 
that they can meander, as side objectives can take on a life of 
their own. Furthermore, there is often temptation for the vari-
ous members of the Circle to follow their own agendas over the 
Circle’s, fracturing the group. When character-driven narratives 
work well, though, they have all the excitement of plot-driven 
Chronicles with the added sense of accomplishment on the part 
of the players for driving the story themselves.

Chronicle Concepts

Each chronicle starts with a basic idea of who the characters 
are and what they’re after. From there, things get a little more 
unpredictable. That being said, there are plenty of tried-but-true 
plotlines that can serve as the backbone for an entire chronicle.
Shadowlands

Guardian Angels — The characters have banded together 
to protect something precious to all of them. It can be a person, 
a group, an item, a neighborhood, or even a city, but regardless 
of the details, the wraiths will do whatever it takes to keep it 
safe. Of course, if they’re trying to keep it safe, someone else 
is  trying  to  destroy  it.  It  could  be  Spectres  looking  to  rend 
someone’s Fetters, mortals proceeding with their own plans, or 
even rival wraiths plotting to eliminate something that gives 
the Circle strength. 

As  the  conflict  between  protectors  and  destroyers  plays 
out,  more  and  more  firepower  gets  brought  to  bear  and  the 
stakes get ever higher. Maybe one side brings in powerful allies, 
or change tactics from sneak attacks to full on assaults. If the 
wraiths succeed, they’re likely to attract the attention of new 
enemies, ones who are tougher than anything the wraiths have 
faced so far. If the Circle fails, however, then the consequences 
of that failure play out. One wraith may lose a Fetter, another 
might lose a Haunt where he conducted his important plans 
— and now they have unfinished business. How they respond? 
Do they pick up the pieces? Look for revenge? Or do they find 
something new to protect to try to make up for their failure?

Poltergeist Party — Nobody’s more fun to mess with than 
the living. The Circle’s decided the hell with the Dictum Mor-
tuum, and their business is haunting the living. Maybe they’re 
working for hire, taking care of things for wraiths who can’t 
take care of things themselves. Or maybe they’re just doing it 
for the laughs — and the Pathos — they get out of terrifying 
the Quick in new and interesting ways. Of course, if they get 
too good at their job they’re likely to attract attention from 
either  ghost  hunters  or  the  Hierarchy,  and  that  could  put  a 
whole new spin on their fun and games.

Dead Kids on the Block — For whatever reason, the wraiths 
all  died  together  and  emerged  from  their  Cauls  at  the  same 
time. Now they need to figure out how to survive while being 
dead, figuring out the rules of the afterlife without teachers or 
help. Unscrupulous Shadows “help” with this process, while the 
wraiths must dodge overaggressive Reapers, predatory Spectres, 
and all the other dangers of the Underworld until they figure 
out how, exactly, to be dead properly.

Necropolis Mine — All of the wraiths have positions of 
respect and authority — or at least responsibility – in their local 
Necropolis.  It’s  their  job  to  deal  with  unreasonable  superiors, 
angry  and  occasionally  Shadow-controlled  residents,  and  the 
semi-regular horde of Spectres that arrive on every Maelstrom. 
Keeping the Necropolis running smoothly in the face of a nev-
erending stream of challenges can be a test for even the strongest 
wraith, and that’s before they have to deal with things like traitors 
selling the Necropolis out, a Heretic cult setting up shop nearby, 
or clueless mortals threatening to tear down a beloved communal 
Haunt. By the end of the chronicle, the wraiths may have risen 
to control the city as Anacreons, or they could suffer political 
reversals that mandate they start the climb again.

Reapers  Keepers  —  The  Circle  plays  a  roving  band  of 
Reapers, scouring the Shadowlands for wraiths who have newly 
crossed over and are ripe for collection. They’re not alone, how-
ever — other bands of Reapers, some working for the Hierarchy 
and some independent — are chasing after those same new souls, 
and not all of them play fair about bringing them in. And even 
if the Circle comes up with the prize, there’s the question of 
what happens next: Do they set the Enfants free, or bring them 
to the forges? Moving from place to place in search of the best 
crops of Enfants can keep the Circle on the go, or bring them 
in conflict with other Reapers whose territory they’ve usurped. 
Deadeye Detective — The wraiths decide they’re going to 
dedicate themselves to righting wrongs in the Skinlands. They 
chase down clues, torment the guilty, and serve as judge, jury, 
and occasional executioner as they take dangerous mortals off 
the streets of the Skinlands. There’s always the chance that 
they accidentally target someone who’s innocent — and who 
seeks revenge when he crosses the Shroud. Alternately, one of 
their targets could be protected by Restless as well, leading to 
a showdown between the target’s patrons and the Circle. 

Let’s Be Dead Cops — The Circle works happily for the 
Hierarchy as enforcers of the Dictum Mortuum, and it’s good at 
what it does. Tracking down violators of Charon’s Law seems 

like a straightforward enough job until the day they cross a red 
line. Do they turn themselves in? Continue to work knowing 
that they’re now susceptible to blackmail for their transgressions? 
Try to atone by hunting down as many Spectres as possible? Cut 
deals with shady Heretics and Renegades in order to confront 
greater problems? And what happens when they need to break 
the Dictum Mortuum themselves? 

Heretic Shuffle — As members of an outlawed cult, the 
wraiths must keep a low profile, moving from Necropolis to 
Necropolis while keeping their faith alive. The characters could 
be sent out to recruit, a dangerous task which could produce 
a Hierarchy bust as often as it produces a potential convert, 
or maybe they’ve been tasked with reaching out to a hidden 
co-religionist dwelling inside a tightly controlled Citadel, or 
they’re embroiled in a bitter rivalry with another sect. 

Oh Mama I’m In Fear For My Life — The Circle is a group 
of Renegades who’ve had it with Stygia. Stygia, unfortunately, 
feels the same way about them, so their existence becomes a 
blur of running, fighting and defying authority. If caught, they’ll 
be hammered into umbrella stands, so every action needs to be 
carefully considered. Daring raids to free comrades sentenced to 
the forges or targeted strikes against Hierarchy targets provide 
exhilaration and danger in equal amounts, while the cumber-
some Legions strive to respond. 

Taking the Band on the Road — The Circle is composed 
of touring Chanteurs and Sandmen, entertainers for hire across 
the Underworld. Traveling from city to city, they provide valu-
able news, gossip, and beauty to their audiences. Maybe this is 
enough, or perhaps they’ve seen or overheard something they 
ought not to have in their travels. This could result in them 
being pursued or blacklisted, with former patrons turning into 
hunters and no one believing the words of some ragged musi-
cians over that of noble lords from ancient families.

Chain  Breakers  —  The  Circle  is  made  up  of  Thralls, 
brought in by malicious Reapers and destined for an eternity of 
servitude — or the forges. But fate gives them the opportunity 
to escape. Do they go on the run, or do they turn the tables 
and try to smash the chains of every wraith held like they were?
Stygia

The  Great  Game  —  The  wraiths  get  caught  up  in  the 
great  game  of  Stygian  politics,  as  their  mentors,  allies,  and 
Deathlords involve them in tangled schemes that could have 
terrifying consequences. Perhaps they’ve been asked to find a 
way to unseat a particular advisor to the Smiling Lord, or to 
steal a powerful Artifact from an ancient and potent wraith, 
and there’s no way to refuse. The stakes are high and the price 
of failure is higher as they try to match wits with wraiths who 
have been doing this for centuries. 

Guild as Charged — Despite their being outlawed, the 
wraiths all belong to various Guilds. Not only do they have 
to make sure they don’t get hauled in by Legionnaires, they 
also have to help sustain the Guild in the face of internal and 
external threats. The political dances between the Guilds are 

268

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

longstanding  and  in  some  cases  deadly,  as  they  scrabble  for 
status and power while still trying to keep their heads down. 
Meanwhile, internal Guild politics can be just as dangerous, 
even if the wraiths think they’re only in the Guild to learn 
how to use their Arcanoi better. Maybe they’ve discovered a 
new expression of an Arcanos, one someone else is willing to 
kill to keep hidden. Or they get approached with knowledge 
that one of the Guilds has been infiltrated by Doppelgangers 
— but there’s no telling which one. And then there’s always 
the looming threat of the War of the Guilds reigniting, setting 
Guild against Guild and Circlemate against Circlemate. Who 
would want such a thing, and can the players stop him before 
he fans the flames into an open conflagration?

The Summons — One member of the Circle is arrested 
for  crimes  that  she  has  no  memory  of  committing.  Did  she 
commit them under the influence of her Shadow? Is she lying? 
Or is someone trying to set her up? The rest of the Circle can 
try to prove her innocence, but this could prove trickier than 
advertised if someone powerful in the Eternal City wants her 
locked up or forged into an ashtray. Alternately, they could try a 
jailbreak, turning the entire Circle into fugitives from Hierarchy 
justice and condemning them all to the forges if they’re caught. 
Stormcrow — An acquaintance of the Circle claims to have 
proof that a Great Maelstrom is coming. Maybe he’s crazy but 
maybe he’s on to something, and if that’s the case, the wraiths 
have to try to convince the powers that be to prepare. Doing so 
isn’t going to be easy, though, as the rivalries between Death-
lords could sabotage any preparations before they get started. 
How the wraiths navigate the most rarefied corridors of power 
within  Stygia  without  getting  arrested  or  worse  makes  for  a 
tight, politically taut chronicle, one that could see its climax 
when the Great Maelstrom unleashes its fury on Stygia’s massive 
walls. On the other hand, maybe their friend is a fraud, leaving 
the players holding the bag with some angry Deathlords after 
the predicted Maelstrom failed to show. 

New in Town — The Circle just arrived in Stygia, ready 
to carve out a new existence for itself there. From exploring 
the city to finding shelter and a place within the walls, new-
comers to Stygia face a wealth of adventure options, as well as 
some very real dangers. This chronicle focuses on the wraiths 
exploring their new environment, seeing the wonders of Stygia, 
and making connections among the venerable dead of the city. 
And of course, whether it be through naivete, foolishness, or 
greed, they get themselves into trouble with wraiths who are 
far older and cannier than they are…

In Ranks — The wraiths are soldiers in the active ranks 
of their respective Legions, and the Legions are going to war. 
Marching off to relieve a besieged Necropolis, the wraiths find 
themselves in the middle of camp intrigues, with spies, traitors, 
and Doppelgangers running amok. Alternately, they could be 
taken into the confidence of a senior officer and find them-
selves playing a more prominent role in the military campaign 
than they would have imagined, for good or for ill. And then 
there’s the actual battle — win or lose, it’s going to be exciting, 

and then there’s the aftermath. Who rises and who falls, who 
gets the glory and who gets the blame, and who’s made eternal 
enemies through their actions? Too much conspicuous valor 
could attract the attention of a vengeful Spectre or a jealous 
rival.  Observers  from  other  Legions  could  carry  the  wraiths’ 
names back to Stygia in their reports, bringing them under the 
watchful gaze of the Deathlords, or the Unlidded Eye.
The Tempest and Beyond

Doomslaying  —  The  wraiths  are  the  best  at  what  they 
do,  and  what  they  do  is  kill  Spectres.  Willing  to  joust  with 
the Shadow-Eaten on their own turf, these relentless warriors 
venture to some of the strangest and most dangerous places in 
the Underworld. Perhaps they’ll explore the Labyrinth while 
chasing  Spectres,  or  go  for  an  unintended  dip  in  the  Sea  of 
Shadows when attacked by their prey. Regardless, hunting down 
and killing Spectres on their own turf — or more — makes for 
an exciting, if sometimes brief, existence.

Chosen of the Ferrymen — For some unknown reason, one 
of the Ferrymen has chosen the wraiths of the Circle to be her 
personal agents. Receiving mysterious instructions from their 
distant patron, the wraiths struggle to accomplish their missions 
and try to unravel the mystery of why they were chosen. Some 
of the missions may make sense, while others are seemingly 
nonsensical, but all are apparently part of the Ferryman’s plan. 
Sailing the Sea of Shadows — The Circle operates a ship 
for hire that plows the great Byways and the Sea of Shadows 
according to its whim. One day they may be taking passengers 
upriver, the next, exploring the depths of the Tempest in hopes 
of snagging a rare plasmic beast. With pirates abounding in the 
Underworld  and  Spectres  always  willing  for  a  wraith  to  get 
careless, the wraiths must struggle to survive. And then there 
are the Maelstroms…

Ambassador to New Lands — The wraiths are chosen to 
act as a Deathlord’s personal emissary to one of the other Dark 
Kingdoms. It is the players’ job to present themselves at the 
new court they’re sent to, and to work for the interests of their 
patron while there. Of course, they could get a better offer, or 
decide to switch sides, and the intrigue surrounding a new court 
could very easily get wraiths, especially inexperienced ones, in 
trouble, and their ability to navigate this strange new world 
they find themselves in with charm and grace could determine 
whether or not they get dragged off to the forges.

Seeking Transcendence — This difficult and potentially 
lengthy chronicle revolves around one (or more) wraith’s decision 
to seek spiritual fulfillment. As the rest of the Circle decides to 
support this quest, they must help their friend find guidance on 
the road to Transcendence and assist them in dealing with their 
unfinished business in the Skinlands. There’s no guarantee of 
success, and the cost of even trying is high. Do they make it to 
the end of the road, or does something derail them along the way?
On the Dark Side — Having one or more players take the 
part of a Spectre can provide a very different experience. Maybe 
there’s one Doppelganger infiltrating a Circle and working to

269

sabotage it from within. Alternately, the entire group could be 
playing Spectres in order to feed their appetite for roleplaying 
destruction. Infiltrating a Necropolis, bringing down a hated 
wraith, or haunting a Byway looking for targets of opportunity 
can all be satisfying Chronicles for a gang of Shadow-Eaten.

Early to Rise — One or more of the wraiths decides they 
want to pursue the myth of the Risen — wraiths who pierce 
the Shroud and climb back into their rotting corpses in order 
to deal with things directly in the Skinlands. With the rest of 
the Circle backing this play, the wraiths must find someone 
who can teach the arts of Returning, and then journey into 
the Labyrinth itself in order to cut a deal to allow for a wraith 
to Rise. And all that is before the Risen actually gets across the 
Shroud and starts wreaking havoc in the Skinlands. 

Stories

Chronicles are made up of individual stories, and the best 
ones arrange their individual stories to support the arc of the entire 
chronicle and produce the greatest effect. Bear in mind that not 
every story needs to be a climactic masterpiece, full of blood and 
thunder. A steady diet of full-throttle can feel stale after a while, 
and if every week is the most important fight of the characters’ 
lives, then eventually none of those fights is going to feel that 
exciting. Rather, it’s more important to vary tone, mixing in qui-
eter and more personal stories with the more explosive ones, and 
giving your chronicle time to breathe in between big revelations 
and earth-shattering throwdowns. The sample chronicles above 
contain plenty of story seeds. Here’s a few more:

To the Walls — A Maelstrom traps the Circle in a Necropo-
lis, and the wraiths are drafted to help defend the desperately 
beleaguered city. At its most basic, it’s action-packed combat 
against a deadly foe. Beyond that, perhaps the wraiths make an 
ally through their valor in the fight — or an enemy by showing up 
the usual local hero. It could be they see something they weren’t 
supposed to during the fight, like one of the local Legionnaires 
feeding a supposed friend to the Spectres, or perhaps one member 
of the Circle gets abducted by the rampaging Shadow-Eaten and 
the next move for the rest of the group is to try to get him back.
End  of  a  Fetter — A mortal who serves as a Fetter for 
one member of the Circle is dying, and the wraith needs to 
deal with this. Maybe the emotional reaction is rage, maybe 
it’s to try to comfort the dying mortal; either way, it’s a highly 
charged, emotional story. 

Mistaken Identity — A local Masquer has made someone 
else up to look like a member of the Circle, and that wraith 
has been getting into all sorts of mischief. Maybe the player 
character gets mistaken for their counterpart, maybe they’re 
blamed for the other wraith’s misdeeds, and maybe it’s just a 
case of wacky hijinks ensuing. In any case, sharing a face with 
another ghost can be tricky — and that’s before the respective 
Shadows get in on the act.

The Great Escape — The wraiths are imprisoned and have 
to get out before they’re soulforged or worse. The members of 

the Circle must plan their escape, then put it into action before 
the ticking clock dooms them. Once they pull it off, they’re 
fugitives, on the run from their former captors. On the other 
hand, the escape attempt might fail, putting the Circle in an 
even more dire position.

Take a Ride — The Circle boards the Midnight Express 
and finds themselves embroiled in some of the events connected 
with that legendary train. Maybe a passenger has disappeared 
and the wraiths must prove their innocence when they’re ac-
cused, or perhaps the train is attacked by Spectres and must 
be defended. Alternately, the Midnight Express could deliver 
the  wraiths  to  someplace  other  than  where  they  wanted  to 
be — and there may be a very good reason for why they were 
sent to this place instead.

Quid Pro Quo — Someone from whom the wraiths want 
something wants something in return. In order to have their 
contact teach them the secrets of becoming Risen, they need 
to go retrieve a long-lost Artifact. To get a favor from a local 
Centurion, they need to escort another wraith safely to Stygia. 
The possibilities are endless. Once the favor is done, theoreti-
cally the wraith the players struck the deal with has to pay up, 
though this isn’t always the case. Sometimes they can’t, some-
times they won’t, and sometimes they’ve been warned not to 
or else something bad will happen to them. At that point, it’s 
the wraiths’ job to get what they were promised…

Passions and Fetters

Passions and Fetters are not merely the Traits that set wraiths 
apart from the other protagonists in the Storyteller games and 
from the other denizens of the World of Darkness. They are 
also integral aspects of Wraith: The Oblivion’s game systems, 
helping make its stories and focus unique. Just as players can use 
these Traits to further characterize their wraiths, you can use 
Passions and Fetters to create a resonant, poignant, and unique 
environment in which to tell stories about them. 

During character creation, you should take special care to 
guide players in choosing their characters’ Passions and Fetters. 
Players should be encouraged to pick innovative and creative 
Passions,  going  beyond  the  obvious  to  give  their  characters 
some unique flair. While “Kill the people who killed my lover 
(Hate)” can provide some good basic stories, players should be 
encouraged to go beyond the obvious and invent some meatier 
motivations. With this in mind, the most obvious emotion to 
describe a Passion is not always the best choice. The perfectly 
functional “Protect my lover (Love)” gets more interesting if it 
becomes “Protect my lover (Greed),” wherein the wraith desires 
that no other should have him if he cannot. You can also try 
“Protect my lover (Hope),” wherein the wraith wants to and 
helps the lover succeed, or “Protect my lover (Pity),” where a 
wraith watches over his still-living partner as he descends into a 
downward spiral of guilt and self-recrimination. Love itself could 
be love for people, love of an ideal, love for money, love of life (a 
bitter Passion for a wraith), or love of oneself. Other Passions can 
be similarly revisited and their full potential explored. You should 

270

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

encourage your players to challenge their assignment of Passions 
to descriptions and find the emotions which most interestingly 
and accurately reflect their vision for their characters. 

The relative levels of the Passions, as determined by the 
number of dots assigned to them, are important. The more dots 
assigned, the more important it is, and the harder for the wraith 
to resist the need to tend to it. Each wraith is constantly torn 
by different, often conflicting emotions, and you should try to 
acquire a sense for the conflicts raging inside the characters 
in your chronicle. Such contradictions and opposites can be 
exploited to force a character to make choices and to confront 
his Passions, deciding what is most important to him and further 
deepening the player’s understanding of his character.

Both  you  and  your  players  should  make  the  characters’ 
Fetters as detailed as possible. Instead of relying on a one-line 
description for the Fetter in question, players should consider 
writing up to a page about each one for their own reference 
and yours. The distinction between Passions (which are ideas, 
emotions,  and  aspirations)  and  Fetters  (which  are  singular 
objects) can be capitalized on and emphasized. Having a player 
create a Fetter like “My old church (3)” is far less descriptive 
and helpful than that same description, as well as some notes 
on the church’s history (Did anyone famous ever speak there? 
Any  supposed  hauntings?  Was  it  ever  burned  down?  What 

was the character’s connection to it?), appearance (What does 
the interior look like? Is it the sort of place that would tempt 
thieves? Any unusual works of art or stained-glass windows?) 
and location (What sort of neighborhood is it in? Who wor-
ships there?). The latter will provide you with more ways to 
work the Fetter into the chronicle, instead of simply having 
it hang in the background as a place the character retreats to 
for Slumber’s sake. 

As Storyteller, your job is made both easier and more chal-
lenging by Passions and Fetters. Passions make the game easier to 
run, in that you should never be at a loss for something to keep 
the narrative flowing and the world detailed. Passions provide 
the Storyteller with kernels from which encounters, images and 
events which players will respond to automatically can be drawn, 
because they are automatically relevant to the characters. Threats 
to or changes in Fetters will also provoke immediate responses 
from wraiths, as they seek to protect what holds them to the 
Shadowlands. On the other hand, you must constantly bear all 
of a character’s Passions and Fetters in mind (it’s a good idea to 
have a reference sheet of them) so that the narrative of the game 
can reflect the mix of Passions present in each wraith and in the 
Circle as a whole. It is also worth noting that each Shadowguide 
should also have detailed knowledge of the Passions and Fetters 
of the wraith whose other half she portrays. 

STORYTELLING

271

Having noted the various Passions and Fetters of the wraiths 
in the group, you are now armed with a set of ideas and emotions 
to flesh out your vision of the Shadowlands and the World of Dark-
ness. Because wraiths are creatures of pure emotion, their reality is 
defined by their Passions. While our vision might be momentarily 
clouded by some strong emotion we feel, a wraith sees everything 
in terms of his Passions, because in a real sense, they are why he 
still exists. Therefore, the emotions represented by the Passions of 
the wraiths are those that will be reflected by the actions, events, 
characters, and stories that are told in that character’s chronicle. 
While in most games it is good practice for a Storyteller who intends 
to design her own stories to take into account the characters and 
their predilections, in Wraith it is critical. 

When the character rolls a Passion to regain Pathos, you 
shouldn’t just let this go past as a rule of the game. Wraiths only 
regain Pathos by accessing their purest emotions and experiencing 
them; therefore, they should give demonstrable evidence of fol-
lowing their Passions. If a wraith is rolling against a Guilt Passion, 
for example, that character should be immersed in that emotion, 
truly experiencing it. To have a player simply say, “I’m rolling 
against my Guilt Passion” is, on some level, to miss the point. 

Wraiths  are  constantly  buffeted  by  their  Passions.  With 
no flesh to safeguard them against feeling, it hits them raw and 
sharp, and they are inevitably changed by the impact. You should 
feel free to utilize the surreal nature of the Underworld to evoke 
the Passions the wraiths access, to make them feel that they are 
creatures of emotion, and help them understand that Pathos is 
more than just a number on a page that allows them to use their 
Arcanoi. Similarly, when wraiths do spend the Pathos to heal or 
employ Arcanoi, they are bleeding pure emotion, and they and 
those around them should sense and be affected by this. 

As well as providing you with events and encounters to detail 
and enrich your vision of the Shadowlands, Passions and Fetters 
can be easily and effectively used to create entire stories. This 
works on two levels. The first and more straightforward of these is 
the use of a Passion or Fetter as the focus for a narrative, placing 
one character at the center of the action and forcing the Circle 
to react to events that involve a Fetter or the object of a Passion. 
Fetters are particularly suited to this kind of tale. They are 
objects that are vitally important to a wraith, that represent links 
to her breathing days and sustain her continued existence in the 
Shadowlands. Playing on this acute vulnerability of wraiths, a 
Storyteller can create situations that force a wraith to act to pro-
tect a valued Fetter. These threats can be as simple as potential 
destruction, or they can be subtle, hinging on the sale, damaging, 
corruption, abuse, neglect, or misuse of a particular Fetter. An 
effective story, for example, might involve the new owner of a 
wraith’s favorite dive bar gentrifying it beyond recognition, or 
perhaps running drugs out of the back and turning it into some-
place dire and unpleasant. Neither of these approaches threatens 
the Fetter with destruction, but both assault the identity it holds 
for the wraith, and each can spark an interesting story. 

Stories can just as easily and evocatively be built around 
Passions, and there are two basic approaches (which are not 

mutually  exclusive).  You  simply  can  choose  an  interesting 
Passion, or one of a generally neglected character, and make it 
the focus of a story. While this is a perfectly satisfactory way to 
initiate character-centered and character-driven narratives, Pas-
sions can be much more sophisticated storytelling tools. Rather 
than look at the specifics of a character Passion, you can build 
a story with that Passion (love, hate, greed etc.) as its theme. 
This kind of approach is well served by preparation, as it takes 
time and creativity to explore a Passion properly, but you can 
also run a rewarding improvised story in this way. While it’s 
a bonus if more than one of the wraiths possesses the Passion 
you choose as your starting point, it is by no means mandatory. 
Wraiths are creatures of Passion, and all emotion is experience 
and sustenance for them. 

Taking the Passion you’ve chosen, you can create a tight 
narrative that centers on events in which the Passion is prominent 
in the motivations of the Storyteller characters, the players, or the 
metaplot behind the events. Alternately, you can devise a series 
of encounters and scenes, each of which evokes a different shade 
or aspect of the Passion. These encounters can be independent or 
somehow linked, but they should always demonstrate the flexible 
and variable nature of the emotion at the center of things. A 
story that takes a particular Passion as its theme should consist 
of both a central plot and satellite encounters that explore and 
expose the Passion, posing hard questions along the way

As an example, the emotion fear could spark many en-
counters and different experiences. The wraiths might become 
involved in a story in which hope (in a typical sense) constitutes 
the central thread of the narrative. Perhaps a wraith could be 
looking frantically for her husband, a new Enfant who might 
have been Reaped and hauled off to the forges. The rest of the 
Circle helps in the search, and along the way they encounter 
enemies and other elements that reflect various aspects of fear: 
fear as resignation, fear as desire, fear as a type of hatred, and 
more. For any other wraith in the Circle with a fear-based Pas-
sion, this could be a particularly productive session, but that 
shouldn’t mean the rest of the group will be left out. A wraith 
with a Passion centered on Hate could very well benefit from 
learning how hatred and fear are intertwined.

A  series  of  scenarios,  each  of  which  takes  a  particular 
character’s Passion as its theme, makes a satisfying chronicle 
and one which probes the characters’ psyches, resulting in well-
rounded and realized wraiths. This cycle of Passion plays brings 
each character face-to-face with her most important aspects. It 
gives the players insight into their characters and, more gener-
ally, into the nature of wraiths and even the nature of emotion. 
These stories can be used as a mini-chronicle from which you 
can launch into a more classically structured narrative, secure 
in the knowledge that the characters taking part have come 
to terms with their identities and understand what it is to be 
a wraith. Or, they can stand alone as a chronicle story cycle. 
This kind of an approach fosters long-term character develop-
ment, and keeps the players engaged with their characters as 
they come to grips with who they are.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Passions and Fetters define wraiths. Passions drive them, 
Fetters anchor them. Both are rich tools you can use to make 
the experience of playing Wraith more beautiful, horrific, sad, 
funny,  and  rewarding.  Wraiths  are  our  reflections,  creatures 
defined by their emotions, and just as no wraith can escape a 
story without using and facing her emotions, no player should 
escape a Wraith session unmoved. 

Advanced Techniques

eginning, middle, and end are the basics of 
telling stories, but they’re not the only way 
to do so. Playing around with sequencing and 
other elements of your chronicle can offer 
surprising rewards if you break outside the 
basics. Doing so may require some planning 
and some help and understanding from your 

players, but the benefits can be considerable.
Flashbacks

Understanding what was can lead to greater understanding 
of what is — and what will be. Playing through a character’s 
personal history can give the player a better knowledge of what 
has gone before. Depending on how your chronicle’s set up, you 
can flash back to the wraith’s younger days, or to the time when 
they were still alive. Doing so can work as a character moment, 
or it can provide clues to current puzzles and obstacles. Real-
izing that a character met a rival wraith back when they were 
both still alive can reframe their relationship — or provide the 
player with clues as to how to defeat a rival.

Running  a  flashback  can  potentially  give  other  players 
insight into a character’s history as well, so being cautious with 
use of this technique is recommended. Functionally, it’s often 
best to treat the flashback like a Harrowing in that the other 
players, instead of sitting off on the sideline, take the parts of 
characters in the flashback. This keeps everyone engaged, takes 
some of the workload off of you, and provides opportunities for 
spontaneous moments. Of course, with a flashback you have 
to  have  a  fixed  ending  in  mind  —  what  has  happened  has 
happened, and regardless of the new elements the scene may 
introduce, the ultimate outcome is already fixed.
Foreshadowing

A foreshadow hints at what is to come without spelling it 
out,  generating  player  interest  and  anxiety  in  equal  measure. 
A good foreshadow doesn’t come out and state what’s going to 
happen next. Rather, it’s a moment or an item of incongruity 
that demands the characters’ attention and provides a clue as 
to what’s on the way. Carrion birds foreshadow death far better 
than visions of bloody dismemberment, particularly if the ravens 
bearing the tidings of doom don’t belong where they’ve been seen. 
Don’t confuse foreshadowing with visions of the future. The 
former consists of signs and portents for the players to guess at 

and interpret. The latter are straightforward views of possible 
futures, removing all ambiguity as to what’s going to happen, 
and they have entirely different narrative uses.
Dreams

Even the dead sometimes dream, as the Sandmen’s Guild 
will happily attest. Making a character’s dream sequences play-
able can serve as an exploration of that character’s subconscious, 
bringing up elements that may be necessary to help the Circle 
advance. Alternately, the rest of the Circle may enlist a Sand-
man’s help to journey into a dreamscape in order to discover 
what troubles one of their own. Symbolism, abstract concepts, 
and endlessly mutable laws of physics are all on the table when 
dream logic is in play, but you should always remember that the 
dream itself is grounded in a character’s mind. 
Symbolism

In the best storytelling, things often represent more than 
they appear to be at first glance. They become symbols of some-
thing deeper — icons of a particular theme, or representations 
of a character or character trait — that infuses the story with 
more meaning than just the obvious. Some symbols are obvious; 
Shakespeare’s putting the head of an ass on a character who 
was a bit of an ass himself in A Midsummer Night’s Dream was 
a bit on the nose, while others are subtler.

The best symbols are ones that are easy to understand but 
hard to pin down. If the villain of your chronicle is the councilor 
to a powerful Stygian wraith, salting your chronicle with nods 
to the character — owl imagery, for example, or other icons 
that evoke wisdom and counsel — can make the reveal of the 
character’s villainy more satisfying, or lead the Circle in the 
right direction if they understand the symbolism. 

As a general rule, you should avoid being too subtle with 
your symbolism. Not everyone has to get everything you put in 
the world, but if nobody uncovers any of it, you face the choice 
of having key elements of your chronicle go by the wayside or 
having to explain your work to your players in a way that can 
bog things down. Use of symbols should enhance, not derail, 
the flow of the game.
Lost Memories

One way to add mystery to a chronicle is to have chunks of 
time that one or more characters can’t remember. The obvious 
explanation for this is a bad case of Catharsis, but even then, 
that begs the question: What did the character(s) do while the 
Shadow was in control? Tracking down the evidence of their 
actions and dealing with the consequences of same can be an 
excuse to add action (“There they are!”) or emotional beats 
for which the Circle must build a context. 

Another possibility is to have the characters affected by 
contact with a Mnemoi, with their memories erased for reasons 
of Stygian security or something more sinister. Making a nod to 
the Bourne series and involving the wraiths in a web of intrigue

they don’t remember being involved with offers plenty of story-
telling opportunities for investigation, chase scenes, and more. 
Unreliable Narrators

Everybody lies, or so goes the saying. That can hold true 
for the narration of your game as well. Just because you’re the 
Storyteller doesn’t mean that every word you speak has to be 
the gospel truth, particularly when filtered through the mouth 
of a character you’re portraying. For good or for ill, players tend 
to take a great many things on faith, and using a Storyteller 
character who appears to be reliable to spread disinformation 
can get the Circle in all sorts of trouble. 

Alternately, you can have the world lie to the Circle. Start-
ing the game inside a Harrowing, so that when the characters 
emerge  they’re  not  sure  what’s  real  and  what’s  Labyrinthine 
artistry,  is  one  way  of  making  sure  players  aren’t  sure  of  the 
ground under their feet. Doing the same with a dream sequence 
is another. As a Storyteller, you’re under an obligation to be 
honest when you speak as the Storyteller, but in other roles 
you’re free to get a little more versatile with the truth.
Crossover Games

The World of Darkness is a densely populated place, and 
the Restless Dead aren’t the only supernatural entities running 
around in it. You don’t have to allow other supernatural creatures 
into your chronicle if you don’t want to — many Storytellers 
find it simpler and thematically cleaner to stick to one kind of 
monster — but if you do decide to go that route, there are plenty 
of ways to incorporate vampires, werewolves, and other such 
entities seamlessly. Certain vampire clans routinely interact with 
the dead, Garou are in constant contact with the spirit world, 
Euthanatos mages very much have death on their minds, and 
among the fae, Sluagh often find they have much to discuss with 
the souls of the dead. And beyond that, you cannot overlook 
the proclivity of the various inhuman entities to rack up body 
counts, thus creating any number of wraiths as they go along.
If you’re going to run a crossover game, it’s important to 
figure out the scope of the crossover. Adding one vampire allows 
you to treat the character as a solitary, threatening monster, a 
unique addition to the chronicle’s world. On the other hand, 
going full throttle with the crossover and adding every manner 
of Awakened imaginable creates a very different tone. 

If the chronicle is going to rely heavily on crossover, it’s also a 
good idea to collaborate with your players on the concept. By neces-
sity, most of the other entities in the World of Darkness operate in 
the Skinlands, so the more Arcanoi the Circle possess to interact 
with them, the better and more connected the chronicle’s going 
to be. Otherwise, you risk leaving players whose characters can’t 
interact directly with the Skinlands out of the action.

The  key  to  a  successful  crossover  chronicle  is  coopera-
tion. If the game dissolves into trying to resolve the question 
of which supernatural creature can beat up which other one, 
then there’s no real point or depth. If, on the other hand, the 
players cooperate with their supernatural allies (whether run 

274

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

CAUTION

As Storyteller, you are the ultimate arbiter of 
what crossover elements are or aren’t allowed in 
your game. Feel free to restrict things to one type of 
supernatural creature, or to alter or adjust the rules 
around other supernatural beings to suit the needs 
of your storytelling. Just because it’s in the rulebook 
— this one or another game’s — doesn’t mean you 
have to allow it if it works against what you’re do-
ing. If there’s a logical reason for a vampire to serve 
as a character’s Fetter, great. If there isn’t, you’re 
perfectly within your rights as Storyteller to say no.

by other players or by you) to use their different abilities, then 
there’s the possibility of telling stories that a totally Wraith-
centric game can’t, and of opening up new aspects of the World 
of Darkness to your chronicle.

Endings

ne of the most difficult aspects of Storytelling 
to  master  is  sticking  the  landing.  Every 
chronicle  has  a  natural  end  point,  and 
making  sure  that  finale  is  satisfying  to 
everyone involved is a tricky skill to master. 
It’s easier to wrap up a particular story 
or play session, knowing that the chronicle 
as a whole is going to continue. Cliffhangers are a perfect way 
to  wrap  up  a  given  session,  driving  the  narrative  along  and 
creating instant energy for when you pick up play. That being 
said,  not  every  chapter  should  end  in  this  manner,  lest  the 
technique lose its impact. 

What you should do at the end of the night’s play, however, 
is make a careful assessment of what you’ve done and where the 
story has gone. Make sure that players are all getting attention 
and time on stage, ensure there are hooks allowing the players 
to move forward and drive the action themselves, and keep 
track of what your Circle did so that you know who said what 
to whom in order to use it later. Doing this — and taking notes 
as needed — is a great way to avoid getting flatfooted down the 
road by either player concerns or players dredging up a minor 
incident that’s long since slipped your mind, and trying to use 
that as a focal point of their actions going forward.

End-of-session assessment is also a good time to figure out 
where you need to be flexible. The best laid chronicles can devi-
ate wildly from their planned structures if the characters decide 
to swerve off the main narrative path, and as a Storyteller you 
need to be prepared for that. Figuring out how far you might 
have slid away from your intentions can help you plan for how 
much work you’ll have to do to lead them back, if you choose 

to do so. It will also help you modify your notes and plans to 
match what’s actually happened in play, and provide hints as 
to where you might need to anticipate where the characters 
might go the next time you play.

Character Destruction

Sometimes Oblivion wins. Not every character is going 
to make it through every scenario unscathed. While they are 
going to survive most of what gets thrown at them, every so 
often things go completely sideways and a character goes down 
for good. Maybe it’s a Destruction Harrowing, maybe it’s a trip 
to the forges, maybe they irritated a powerful Masquer and got 
Moliated into a lawn chair. Regardless, there will be moments 
in a chronicle when a character meets his end, and you should 
be prepared for what this does to the story.

What it means for the characters is different than what 
it  means  for  the  players.  If  the  player  of  the  late,  lamented 
character isn’t really fitting in with the group, then this can 
serve as a perfect moment to make a change. If, however, the 
player is well liked and wants to continue, you should sit down 
and help him create a new character. This new wraith can be 
informed by what the Circle has seen of the story so far, shor-
ing up the group’s weaknesses and bringing a new skill or bit of 
knowledge to the table that the rest are lacking. If you’re feeling 
particularly devious, there’s always the possibility of inserting 
a Spectre character into the game, and having the player take 
on the part of a Doppelganger, rather than a wraith. If you’re 
feeling particularly sneaky and the character met his end in a 
Harrowing, you can always conspire with the player to have 
him come back as a Spectre, infiltrating the Circle and playing 
on old friendships for Oblivion’s ends. 

Then  there’s  the  character  side.  The  rest  of  the  Circle 
should react to the loss of a companion, particularly if the way 
she was annihilated set off either a Passion or a Dark Passion. 
They may not believe she’s gone for good, and decide to quest 
after her to bring her back. They may seek revenge on the one 
responsible for her destruction. They might even decide to dedi-
cate themselves to fulfilling her goals — if she’d been seeking 
Transcendence when she was dragged down to the Void, maybe 
the rest of the Circle will now seek that exalted state in her 
memory. Alternately, they may just decide to divvy up her stuff 
and keep moving. It all depends on the characters as described.
That being said, Storytelling death is tricky for the Rest-
less  Dead.  For  all  that  they’re  already  deceased,  wraiths  are 
incredibly difficult to destroy permanently. There’s only a few 
ways to do it, and a Harrowing is never a sure thing. Even so, 
things happen and you should always be willing to tweak things 
as necessary to keep a character going if a dice-dictated death 
would be goofy, annoying, or emotionally unsatisfying. Death 
is an incredibly powerful Storytelling tool and you should use a 
light touch with it. Too high a body count and players will stop 
getting attached to their characters in self-defense. Too low of 
one, on the other hand, means that the threats are insufficient,

275

and there may be a sense among the Circle that since they’re 
the universe’s favored children, they’re not in any real danger. 
At that moment, feel free to prove the Circle wrong.
A character death should always feel satisfying and it should 
always feel appropriate, even if sudden or shocking. Picking off 
a character at random just because you can doesn’t serve the 
chronicle or the characters. A fight against impossible odds, 
a sacrifice to save the rest of the Circle, the well-planned tri-
umph of an enemy: These are the sorts of things that can bring 
emotional satisfaction to the pain of losing a beloved character. 
A meaningless, sudden death, while perhaps truer to the ethos 
of Wraith, makes for worse Storytelling. 

Chronicle Endings
Timing

The first part of getting it right is understanding the timing. 
If the Circle in your game is chasing a particular nemesis, then 
eventually they must be able to confront and defeat — or other-
wise have a satisfying resolution with — that nemesis. Endlessly 
stringing things out because you’re not ready to put the final boss 
on stage eventually makes things feel like they’re being artificially 
stretched out, and as a result the chronicle loses the urgency that 

drives it. Also, doing so diminishes the Circle’s progress toward 
their  desired  showdown  with  their  enemy,  and  slowing  that 
progress can feel discouraging. If the players get the sense that 
nothing they do will bring them closer to the final conflict, then 
they’re going to question why they’re doing anything at all, and 
that’s a death knell for a continuing narrative. So, understand-
ing the dynamics of your chronicle and sensing when it’s time 
to kick things into gear for the grand finale means listening to 
your players, both to what they say and what they don’t say. If 
momentum seems to be inexorably flagging or the characters 
complain that they’re not getting any closer to winning, it may 
be time to consider bringing things to a smashing conclusion.

The flip side of this is avoiding rushing. Final showdowns 
are exciting, spectacular, and cool, but you should be wary of 
rushing into them for their own sake. As explosive as a duel 
with a Deathlord atop the Onyx Tower might be, having that 
moment hit three sessions in robs it of the buildup and anticipa-
tion that would help make it satisfying. A grand finale is only as 
good as the players’ feelings about it, and if they’re insufficiently 
excited about an ultimate triumph because the villain wasn’t 
given sufficient development time to be hate-worthy, then the 
finale’s going to fall flat. A full-out sprint to the end means you 
miss a lot of the interesting moments along the way, and that 
arriving at your narrative destination lacks impact as a result.

276

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Power

The other half of the equation is making sure the end of the 
chronicle has sufficient and appropriate impact. The end of the 
chronicle has to mark a significant change, either in the world 
or in the wraiths of the Circle. To fight the big bad and win, only 
to have another, identical enemy rise up is unsatisfying, a reset 
button that puts the game right back where it started. Instead, 
the finale needs to be the summation of what the characters 
have done and experienced along the way to this moment. 

That’s not to say that the ending automatically has to be 
a happy one. Sometimes losing, or a well-timed reversal that 
puts a new spin on the Circle’s world can be just as satisfying 
as putting a long-hated enemy out of business for good. What 
matters is that the ending draws from the rest of the chronicle 
in a way that feels organic and natural. 
Aftermath

The chronicle shouldn’t end with the end of the battle, 
however. There needs to be a denouement, time for the players 
and characters to come to grips with the new normal and get 
ready for their next adventures. Make sure there’s enough time 
for all the questions that need to be answered to get answered, 
in order to make the players feel satisfied about what they’ve 
accomplished. If necessary, consider adding a Storyteller char-
acter whose function is to provide explanations of how the gaps 
in the narrative were bridged behind the scenes — the old ally 
who was more involved than they knew, or a servant of the 
defeated rival who’s telling all in order to save his own skin. 
You’ll also want to establish what the world of the charac-
ters is going to be like going forward. If the Circle took down a 
Shadow-Eaten Deathlord, maybe one of them will be selected 
to fill the role going forward, and the other wraiths become her 
trusted advisors. If the big win was taking down a mortal threat 
to dozens of wraiths’ Fetters, then giving the Circle visibly new 
status among those wraiths shows that what they did meant 
something. And if the finale was fighting a monstrous Spectre, 
then showing new monsters rushing to fill the power void — and 
demonstrating fear and loathing of the Circle — goes a long 
way toward demonstrating a satisfying impact.

End of chronicle can also mean end of game, though it 
doesn’t have to. If you and some (or all) of your players want 
to continue with the same cast of characters, the end of one 
chronicle is the jumping-off point for the next. Make sure to 
establish hooks that will bridge the space to the start of the 
next story — the devoted servant of the disgraced Deathlord 
who’s sworn revenge, the ominous tolling of Maelstrom warning 
bells, a cryptic prophecy from a Ferryman who witnessed their 
triumph — so that there’s a sense of continuity in your Story-
telling, and so that it feels like the next chronicle is the logical 
outgrowth of this one. Past character (and player) experience 
should inform future stories, giving you a wealth of knowledge 
about the characters to draw on in setting up new adventures, 
and giving players a deep base to roleplay from.

On the other hand, if ending the chronicle means end-
ing the game, then make sure to leave everyone satisfied with 
how things end up. That doesn’t mean the characters have to 
be perfectly content, but the ending of the chronicle should 
make the players feel like they weren’t cheated by the ending. 
Check to make sure the big questions from each character’s 
plot threads, whether they be Passion-driven or emergent from 
the chronicle’s narrative, have been resolved so that everyone 
involved can feel comfortable saying goodbye.

Authority & Responsibility

raith can be a tricky game to Storytell and 
to  play.  Not  everyone’s  a  good  fit  for  the 
game,  in  exactly  the  same  way  that  not 
everyone’s  great  at  baseball  or  poker  or 
whatever. If there’s a player in your group 
who’s struggling, you owe it to the entire 
troupe to help that person out. Maybe that 
means taking a little extra time with the player to find out what 
the roadblocks are. If it’s uncertainty about the rules, knowing 
that means you can work around it. If Shadowguiding is too 
much work or the split in focus isn’t enjoyable, you can assign 
those Shadowguiding duties to someone else and let the player 
concentrate on taking care of business. 

And if it turns out that Wraith just isn’t that player’s cup 
of tea, that’s fine. There’s no shame in deciding that a player 
isn’t right for a game or a game isn’t right for a player. This isn’t 
a failure of your Storytelling, nor is it a failure of anyone’s play. 
It just means that sometimes player and game are just a bad fit, 
and both need to move on. If there’s a player in your game who 
is obviously not enjoying it or is struggling to the point where it’s 
impacting other players’ fun, eventually you will want to step in 
and suggest that player drop out of the game. This should never 
be couched as “We don’t want to play with you any more,” but 
rather in the context of “You’re not having fun and you shouldn’t 
feel obligated to hang around doing something you don’t enjoy.”
Alternately,  some  players  are  just  jerks.  Ones  who  enjoy 
maliciously pushing other players’ buttons, especially while Shad-
owguiding, have no place in a friendly troupe, and as a Storyteller 
you should have no compunctions about telling a griefer to hit 
the road. That doesn’t mean that a rambunctious player should 
automatically  get  the  heave-ho,  but  one  who  repeatedly  and 
aggressively makes active moves to hinder others’ enjoyment or 
cause emotional harm simply doesn’t belong in a friendly game.
Ultimately, it’s your game, and as Storyteller the greater 
part of the responsibility for keeping it running smoothly and 
enjoyably for everyone falls on you. Sometimes that means re-
warding players who are beneficial to the group, sometimes that 
means helping out players who are struggling, and sometimes 
it means tossing a disruptive player for everyone else’s benefit.

STORYTELLING

here  are  certain  things  wraiths  do 
differently than everyone else. Everything 
from  walking  through  walls  to  gaining 
experience has a particular twist for the 
Restless, and understanding these unique 
approaches is key to understanding how 
certain  key  elements  of  Underworld 

existence work. 

This chapter is broken up into three sections: Setting, 
Perceptions,  and  Character  Development.  The  first  is  all 
about how to interact with certain wraith-specific elements 

of the setting, such as Haunts, Maelstroms, and how wraiths 
deal with injuries (and solid objects). The second, Percep-
tions, is about the quest for Transcendence, the elusive state 
of  spiritual  ascension  that  supposedly  lifts  a  wraith  out  of 
the Underworld and onto a higher plane of existence. Most 
wraiths, if questioned, will say that they think Transcendence 
is a myth, but there are always those few who believe. Finally, 
Character Development is about the awarding and spend-
ing of Experience Points, allowing players to develop their 
characters over the course of a campaign. 

Chapter 8:  SystemsReaping
Reborn with A Caul

hen  a  person  dies  with  enough  passion, 
determination, and sheer will to carry on 
to  create  a  wraith,  they  emerge  in  the 
Shadowlands  covered  by  a  gauzy  shroud 
of spiritual energy known as a Caul. This 
ectoplasmic  wrapping  shelters  the  new 
Restless  during  their  transition  to  the 
afterlife and allows time for her mind to begin processing the 
fact of her own death. While the Caul is in place, the wraith 
can perceive the Shadowlands, but her view is distorted, with 
elements from it blending into her own thoughts and feelings.
Unfortunately for many wraiths, Enfants still wrapped in 
their Cauls are vulnerable to all manner of predators, from 
slave-taking Harvesters to marauding Spectres to manipula-
tive organizations of all ideologies and persuasions. While it 
is easiest on the Psyche of a wraith to be gently helped out of 
her Caul — or find the strength to remove it herself — the 
unfortunate reality is that there isn’t always time for her to 
do so. This factor, more than many others, goes a long way 
toward explaining certain behaviors in the Underworld. When 
your first interaction with your new existence is one of pain 
and confusion, it sets a tone that can be difficult to change.

A wraith emerging from the Caul must not only cope with 
the immediate reality of her surroundings and the actions of 
other Restless in the area, but also her new senses themselves. 
Lifesight shows flares and flashes of color in the Shadowlands, 
while Deathsight means that the longer she looks at any one 
thing the more she seems to see it wither, crumble, and fall into 
decay. Often, she has an encounter with the Incorporeal state 
early on as well, as she attempts to interact with the Skinlands 
out of reflex. Processing her new levels of perception and the 
mutability of her new body takes time, adding to early feelings 
of shock and disorientation.   

As for the Caul itself, it vanishes in a rush of Pathos as 
soon as it is removed, making it a difficult subject to study. 
While there are stories of pieces or even whole Cauls remain-
ing behind on rare occasions — and which supposedly bestow 
power over the wraith they belonged to — these claims aren’t 
substantiated. Attempts to study intact Cauls by examining 
Enfants find it highly resistant to anything other than removal; 
it is not armor, but does resist being clipped or cut into smaller 
pieces. Wraiths handling a Caul describe it as cold but also 
pulsing faintly, like the memory of a heartbeat. If one puts 
their ear to it, he can hear a babble of voices, too faint and 

indistinct to make any sense out of.  Seasoned Reapers might 
describe this as the memories of the Enfant wrapped into the 
fabric of the Caul.

This section details the systems involved in three different 
forms of Reaping: freeing yourself from your own Caul, gently 
guiding another wraith out of their Caul, and the Caul being 
forcibly torn away.
Removing Your Own Caul

A wraith who emerges in an isolated area, or in the wake 
of  a  great  disaster  that  sees  too  many  Enfants  remove  their 
Cauls just in time for the Harvesters to get to them, may find 
it  necessary  to  remove  her  own  Caul.  Some  kindly  Reapers 
will even give an Enfant time to see if she has the strength of 
will to break free on her own, stepping in only if she seems to 
be struggling. Wraiths who manage the feat of removing their 
own Caul enjoy a small measure of respect — it takes a strong 
sense of self to be able to accept the reality of death and the 
subsequent transition to the Shadowlands, as opposed to being 
helped through it by another or simply forced into it all at once. 
System: In order to remove her own Caul, a wraith must 
come to terms with the knowledge that she has died, and then 
spend 1 Willpower. The wraith then rolls Willpower, difficulty 4, 
with each success adding 1 Pathos to her normal starting total. 
As removing the Caul is a singular experience in a wraith’s 
existence, this infusion may take her over the usual maximum 
of 10 Pathos. As long as she exceeds 10 Pathos, she actually 
glows with emotional energy, and stands out as almost lifelike 
while over 10 Pathos levels. (Subtract 1 from the difficulty of 
all Perception rolls to notice or track the wraith while she is in 
this state, unless she uses some sort of Arcanos power to hide 
herself.) This excess Pathos remains until it is spent. 
Guiding Hands

Though they are rare in the Shadowlands, there are Reap-
ers who see the act as a noble duty, and who genuinely want 
to help ease new Restless into their existence as painlessly as 
possible. These kindly Reapers are scoffed at by more mercenary 
Harvesters, but there are rewards for their work that more than 
compensate. 

Beyond the likely gratitude of the Enfant in question, peace-
fully transitioning a wraith fully into the Shadowlands offers 
the Reaper an infusion of Pathos from the energy release of the

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

SettingOPTIONAL RULE: CRUCIBLE SCENES 
Many Wraith games begin with the characters already Reaped, or handle the removal of the Caul as a 
purely narrative device in a montage or flashback. However, Storytellers who are interested in delving into 
playing out the transitional period while a wraith is still wearing her Caul can run what is called a Crucible 
scene. This optional rule is particularly appropriate if the players have played their characters as mortals for 
a session or more and the death experience is being handled during ongoing play.

A Crucible scene involves the wraith reliving the moments surrounding her death, sometimes multiple 
times, an already stressful and confusing situation that is further complicated by the fact that sensations from 
the Shadowlands creep in as well. While still wearing her Caul, a wraith might see her mortal lover but hear 
the voice of one of the nearby Restless calling out to her, or watch in horror as a bloody Legionnaire strides 
into her memory of her suburban home and demands to know whose property she is. Though the experiences 
vary by each wraith, the ultimate goal of a Crucible scene is always the same — accepting that she is dead 
and emerging into the Shadowlands proper.

In roleplaying terms, a Crucible is handled much like a Harrowing in that each wraith must confront it 
alone, and so it can serve as a good way to transition new players into these sorts of intensive solo experiences. 
Other players may participate as the Storyteller permits, portraying characters from the wraith’s memories 
or even the distorted perceptions of other Restless interacting with her in the Underworld. The emerging 
wraith’s strongest Passions and Fetters also tend to figure prominently, as well as certain relevant Backgrounds 
such as Eidolon or Memoriam. Of course, the Shadow is there as well — not so strong as it will be in future 
Harrowings, but already whispering.

From a mechanics standpoint, this optional rule changes some Reaping systems. A character may not 
remove her own Caul unless she completes a successful Crucible scene, at which time she pays costs and 
receives benefits normally. (If this would interrupt the flow of play, the Storyteller may choose to declare the 
effort successful and simply play the scene later as a flashback.) With regard to a guided Reaping, the Reaper 
may enter the Crucible scene more directly and interact with the wraith without the confusion of the Caul 
distorting their words. Harvesting is unchanged, save that the Crucible scene of a Harvested wraith is likely 
to end abruptly, typically in the most disturbing and upsetting way possible. 

Though it is most common at the beginning of a chronicle, the Storyteller may choose to play out or 
revisit Crucible scenes as flashbacks later on — remembering these emotionally charged early moments can 
provide insight into something later on during play, especially for Transcendence-oriented characters.

Caul. Thus both parties benefit — an all-too-rare circumstance 
in the Shadowlands. 

System: A Reaper who wishes to peacefully assist in re-
moving an Enfant’s Caul can spend 1 Willpower to establish a 
link with the target. This allows the Reaper to interact more 
directly with the target despite the interference of the Caul. 
Even with the compressed time playing out in the Caul, this 
process takes at least 10 minutes and may take hours, depend-
ing on the Enfant’s strength of will and ability to navigate her 
new Passions. 

While doing this, the Reaper must stay close to her charge 
and concentrate on the process, but remains fully aware of her 
surroundings. She may break it off at any time, leaving the Caul 
intact or forcibly removing it as she desires when she does so. 
Rules for forcible removal are outlined under Soul Harvesting, 
below. There are no penalties for interrupting a peaceful Reap-
ing, save that the Reaper must spend another Willpower point 
to reestablish contact.

Once a connection is created, the Reaper injects herself 
into  the  psychodrama  of  the  Enfant’s  Caul  in  order  to  help 
guide the new wraith. The Reaper rolls Charisma + Empathy 
at  a  difficulty  of  9  -  the  target’s  Memoriam  rating.  Success 
indicates  the  Reaper  is  able  to  help  the  wraith  remove  her 
Caul successfully and with a minimal amount of mental and 
emotional trauma. Note that due to the very personal nature 
of the Caul, the Reaper does not remember fine details of what 
he experienced while inside. Attempting to use this power to 
infiltrate the new wraith’s mind to learn their secrets is therefore 
not likely to generate much in the way of hard intelligence. 
The Reaper remembers vague impressions and strong feelings, 
but that’s about it. 

However, their emotional connection to the Enfant does 
decrease the difficulty of Empathy rolls by 2 for the rest of the 
session; this time may be increased at the Storyteller’s discre-
tion if the Reaper remains in close contact with the Enfant. A 
successful guided Reaping like this one also grants the Reaper a 
number of Pathos points equal to the Enfant’s Memoriam rating 

SYSTEMS

281

+ 2. This does not allow the Reaper to exceed their maximum 
Pathos. Any excess Pathos is lost in a glowing golden haze that 
can be seen for some distance. 

Multiple Reapers may attempt to help remove a Caul to-
gether, using the normal teamwork rules for the relevant roll. 
This tends to reduce the time required significantly, but the 
amount of Pathos resulting from a successful Reaping of this 
type must be shared by the group. Each Reaper must receive 
an equal amount if that is possible. If there is no way to share 
the Pathos equally, the Reaper who made the roll determines 
which Reapers receive any (extra) Pathos. 
Soul Harvesting

Souls are the biggest business of the Underworld, and so 
many Reapers have neither the time nor inclination to work 
gently with the Enfants they find. Instead, the Reaper rips off 
the Caul, slaps on Stygian steel cuffs, and sends the poor soul 
packing to the market (or the foundries). 

However, even less mercenary wraiths sometimes must tear 
off an Enfant’s Caul with little regard for kindness or finesse, 
typically due to some looming threat: an inbound Maelstrom, 
an attack by hostile Nephwracks, or even simply to keep the 
Enfant out of the hands of unsavory Harvesters. Removing a 
Caul carefully takes time, after all, and sometimes that is simply 
not a commodity that can be spared.  

System: Having the Caul forcibly removed incurs no cost or 
mechanical penalty, but the wraith is almost certainly going to 
be in a far worse mental and emotional state as their protective 
covering is abruptly ripped away. Players whose characters are 
Reaped in this fashion are encouraged to play up this disorienta-
tion and fear, as well as the confusion of suddenly plunging from 
a memory of life into the reality of the Shadowlands.

The Shroud

he Shroud is the name wraiths give to the 
barrier that separates the Shadowlands from 
the Skinlands. In truth, it is less a physical 
barrier and more of a filter — an invisible, 
intangible field that blocks out the reality of the 
Shadowlands from the senses of the Quick. It 
is the reason that a mortal can blithely ignore 
the existence of a wraith frantically trying to get her attention just 
inches from her face, and also what makes it difficult for the Restless 
to use their Arcanoi to affect the world of the living.

In game terms, the strength of the Shroud is expressed as a 
rating from 4-10, based on how conducive the area is to the belief 
in ghosts. The Shroud is strongest in times and places where 
the existence of ghosts feels easiest to dismiss, such as brightly 
lit  office  buildings  at  noon,  city  parks  on  sunny  afternoons, 
or a brand-new outlet mall. It is weakest in places where the 
existence of the Restless seems much harder to discount, like 
an abandoned cemetery at night or a famous haunted house.  

282

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The  Shroud  rating  of  a  location  can  fluctuate  slightly 
depending on the time of year or even time of day, not to men-
tion factors like the presence of large crowds. For example, an 
imposing old mansion visited on a large daytime tour might have 
a Shroud rating one or two points higher than it does when it’s 
empty at night. Flip the calendar forward to Halloween, and it 
goes down again. Note that the beliefs of mortals in the area 
don’t factor in to this calculation; the Shroud rating is based 
on  the  nature  of  the  location  itself.  Ghost  hunters  who  are 
true believers don’t lower the Shroud rating of a sunny park 
just by their presence, for example, though they might trigger 
a Hysteria response if nearby wraiths begin using their Arcanoi 
(see “Did You Guys Hear That?” below).  

As the local Shroud rating decreases, it becomes easier for 
the Restless to affect the Skinlands (and vice versa). Hypotheti-
cally, if a location ever reached a zero Shroud rating, the living 
and the dead would be able to see and interact without the need 
for any Arcanoi at all — but that also means nothing would 
be holding raw Oblivion back from infecting the Skinlands. 
Fortunately, the lowest Shroud rating possible is 4, and nothing 
known can reduce it below that.

Other  supernatural  creatures  —  vampires,  werewolves, 
mages, changelings, etc. — naturally thin the Shroud by their 
very presence. (Certain powerful gifted mortals can have the 
same effect, especially talented mediums and other spiritualists.) 
The Shroud rating is reduced by 2 in the immediate vicinity of 
a supernatural creature, though it still may not fall below 4 at 
any time. This applies even if a supernatural creature has no 
particular affinity for the Shadowlands. Their mere presence 
naturally makes the Underworld feel more possible.

The Shroud also obfuscates evidence of the Restless when 
it comes to recordings, whether audio or visual. Images that 
are clear in person become blurry and indistinct, while audio 
is muted and garbled. Evidence is not destroyed outright, but 
rendered easier to discredit by the skeptical. This does not mean 
a wraith will not be punished for violating the Dictum Mortuum 
if he is caught on camera in this fashion, simply that the search 
for “definitive” evidence of the Restless is forever frustrating for 
investigators. Especially when it is combined with the mind-
clouding effects of the Fog on the average mortal, the effects 
of the Shroud serve to cast doubt on any “proof” obtained of 
the actions of the Restless Dead.  

While potent, there are limits to the Shroud’s ability to 
cloud evidence. If a wraith is Materialized, anything she does 
is captured as clearly as one of the living, including any Arca-
nos used with visible effects. In addition, certain supernatural 
powers or technologies may be able to create accurate record-
ings. The empire employs specialists that aggressively work to 
distort or suppress evidence from such incidents, but they are 
not always readily available, and in the digital age material can 
get widespread attention faster than ever. The more the wraith 
does, the harder it is to remove this evidence.  

“DID YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?”

Fear is highly contagious, and a special shared 
fright  can  temporarily  weaken  the  Shroud  as 
frightened  mortals  become  more  open  to  the 
supernatural. In game terms, this phenomenon 
is  known  as  Hysteria,  and  can  have  a  real  (if 
short-lived)  impact  on  the  local  Shroud  rat-
ing. Each time the Restless succeed in seriously 
frightening  a  mortal  with  their  actions,  and 
that  mortal  spreads  their  fears  to  others,  the 
Storyteller may invoke Hysteria and reduce the 
local Shroud rating by one. 

The majority of the mortals present must be 
frightened — scaring just one or two in a large 
crowd is not enough — and so Hysteria gener-
ally works best when a wraith can isolate a small 
group to focus on. Hysteria cannot reduce the 
local Shroud rating by more than three points, 
and can never reduce it below 4 no matter what. 
In addition, each subsequent scare in a scene 
needs to be more chilling and effective to qualify. 
Hysteria must build as it goes on, requiring more 
impressively executed scares. 

All Shroud reductions due to Hysteria fade 
at the end of the scene. These reductions also 
may be negated earlier if the mortals have time 
to collect themselves, if a strong leader is able to 
get a hold of the group, or if other factors quash 
the rising tide of panic. Hysteria is a powerful 
tool, but a fragile one.

Naturally, actively attempting to cultivate 
Hysteria  usually  requires  a  level  of  Arcanos 
use and interference with mortals that clearly 
violates the Dictum Mortuum, but wraiths look-
ing to scare mortals away from their Haunt or 
harvest some intense Pathos are often willing 
to overlook the legal aspects of their behavior.

It is also worth noting that the Shroud is lower in a Haunt 
due to the constant presence and activity of the Restless in the 
location.  When  considering  a  Haunt,  calculate  the  Shroud 
rating  the  place  would  have  normally,  and  then  decrease  it 
by the rating of the Haunt. The Shroud still cannot be lower 
than  4,  but  if  it  would  be  lower,  the  Storyteller  may  permit 
wraiths to generate certain atmospheric effects without mak-
ing expenditures — nothing as powerful as Arcanos use, but 
simply eerie elements befitting the nature of the Haunt and 
the wraiths inside.

The Fog

any  mortals  claim  they  would  love  to  see 
a  ghost,  if  only  to  put  the  whole  afterlife 
question to rest once and for all, but at the 
same  time,  deep  down  they’re  terrified  of 
exactly what they might find. The Restless 
know this fear is well founded, as very few 
mortals come close to imagining the realities 
of the Underworld that awaits them. What’s more, fewer still 

would want that knowledge even if they could find a way to 
obtain it. 

As a result, when a human witnesses a display of supernatural 
activity by the Restless, they may accept and respond to it in the 
moment, but afterward their minds actively work to rationalize 
and repress what they have seen. Encounters with wraiths become 
little more than vivid nightmares, bad drug trips, or even a bit 
of undigested beef playing havoc with one’s system. This phe-
nomenon is known as the Fog, and while it can protect careless 
wraiths  from  attracting  ghost  hunters  tramping  through  their 
Haunts with night-vision cameras, it can also make it very dif-
ficult to establish meaningful contact with friends and loved ones.
The Fog does not apply to all mortals, however. Children, 
animals, and some gifted humans react to the presence of the 
Restless however seems appropriate to them, without reverting 
to more instinctual forms of behavior. This does not mean that 
such  individuals  automatically  see  the  Restless  all  the  time, 
but they tend to notice their presence if the Shroud is low, the 
wraith is someone they recognize, the wraith is exerting a lot 
of effort, or if the Storyteller feels it is narratively appropriate.
Supernatural  creatures  also  do  not  have  their  reactions 
dictated by the Fog. Their perspectives are naturally a bit broader 
than those of mortals; even if they have not encountered ghosts 

284

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

before, the existence of the Restless does not shake them on 
a  fundamental  level.  Note  that  most  supernatural  creatures 
cannot automatically see past the Shroud, but should a wraith 
be revealed to them somehow, they may react as they see fit 
rather than as dictated by the Fog chart. As a rule of thumb, 
Giovanni and Samedi vampires, Silent Strider and Stargazer 
werewolves, Corax wereravens, Euthanatos and Dreamspeaker 
mages, and sluagh changelings are the supernatural beings most 
likely to be able to detect nearby wraiths. For more on other 
dwellers in the World of Darkness, see p. 405. 

The following chart describes how mortals typically react 
to witnessing overt Arcanos use or even coming face to face 
with one of the Restless, as based on the mortal’s Willpower 
rating. The Storyteller may adjust these reactions based on the 
personality of the mortal in question, how well prepared she is 
for the encounter, her relationship with the wraith herself, or 
any other factors the Storyteller feels are relevant. 

For example, the Storyteller may decide that despite having 
a Willpower rating of 4, an occult researcher might react more in 
keeping with a Willpower of 8 after studying the history of the 
location and preparing for the encounter. Or the Storyteller may 
rule that a mortal’s ability to control herself may gradually increase 
due to repeated exposure, at least with wraiths she has encountered.
This  sort  of  alteration  should  not  come  up  too  often, 
however, as terror is an inescapable part of the living making 
contact with the dead, and unpredictable responses are part of 
what makes the Fog so compelling dramatically. It is a staple 
of ghost stories that characters who seem strong crack under 
pressure, for example, while others that appear timid at first 
glance show real resolve when it counts. 

However, remember that while mortals might be able to 
mitigate some of the worst effects of the Fog with experience 
and preparation, it is not something that can be totally con-
quered. It will always be a factor in dealings between the living 
and the Restless.

Catatonic Fear: Terrified into near paralysis, mortals can do little more than whimper softly and try to crawl to 
a hiding place. Rational thought, cogent conversation, and complex actions are completely out of the question. 

Panic: The mortal shrieks and flees by the most direct route possible that is not immediately suicidal. They won’t 
jump out a high window, but might run out into the street without checking  too carefully.

Disbelief: The mortal is in utter denial, believing this to be some sort of trick or special effect or even a reality 
television show playing a prank. Attempting to convince them otherwise just increases the fervor of their denials, 
possibly to the point of violence. 

Berserk: The wrongness of the wraith’s very existence triggers a savage attack response, as the mortal lashes out 
with whatever’s at hand to destroy the source of their fear. If such attacks seem to have no effect, the mortal settles 
for smashing objects instead. 

Terror: Deeply scared but still in control of herself, the mortal attempts to get away from the wraith’s presence as 
quickly as she can. It is, however, a reasoning retreat. She will not endanger herself and does not feel compelled 
to flee screaming into the night. 

Conciliatory: While terrified, the mortal attempts to bargain with the wraith, offering whatever he thinks the 
wraith might want. Usually this means offering the sort of things he’s heard of in ghost stories, like helping with 
unfinished business or undelivered messages.

Controlled Fear: A mortal with this degree of self-control is scared but able to completely control its influence 
on her actions, allowing her to make good judgments and execute complex actions normally.

Curiosity: Though not without fear, mortals at this level are more fascinated than anything else, and may seek 
to document their experience with a camera phone or other equipment at hand. Their interest can border on 
obsessive and intrusive, however, and often is more zealous than the wraith is expecting.

Righteous Anger: These mortals absolutely refuse to give ground, no matter how terrifying the wraith might ap-
pear to be or how vicious the Arcanoi being used. While they are not blind to the possibility of retreat, they show 
no fear and will do everything they can to fight back.

No Reaction: Rarest of the rare, these mortals have no particular reaction whatsoever. For whatever reason, the 
Restless are nothing special to him. Maybe he is particularly fatalistic, or perhaps he believes the wraith is some 
kind of higher being. He might just not be the sharpest tool in the shed, as they say. Regardless, he simply doesn’t 
have a strong reaction to the wraith’s presence.

Maelstroms

here  is  plenty  to  fear  in  the  Underworld, 
but few threats inspire as much dread as the 
ruinous catastrophes known as Maelstroms. 
Spawned by great tragedies and mass deaths 
in the mortal world, Maelstroms boil up out 
of the Tempest and leave destruction in their 
wake. And none are more feared than Great 
Maelstroms, the direst form of this phenomenon, which result 
from the worst disasters in the mortal realm. Thankfully, these 
Great Maelstroms are also so rare and their damage so profound 
that they are used to mark eras of Underworld history. 

Aside from already lethal hazards such as howling winds, 
choking  ash,  and  searing  lightning,  Maelstroms  also  bring 
Spectres with them, riding unharmed on the winds of the storm 
to swoop down on wraiths caught away from shelter. Scholars 
ponder whether Maelstroms themselves are at least partially 
sentient, as they seem to strike in ways designed to cause the 
greatest damage to the largest number of wraiths. It is almost as 
if the storm tailors which hazards strike where so that the most 
vulnerable wraiths are exposed to a given threat.

While the Great Maelstroms are used to mark the end of 
one  epoch  and  the  beginning  of  another,  even  the  smallest 
Maelstrom is dangerous. More serious Maelstroms pose a threat 
to all but the sturdiest Haunts and stoutest citadels, and are a 
major reason that few wraiths truly “go it alone” in the long 
run.  There  is  simply  no  way  to  survive  stronger  Maelstroms 
without  a  strong  Haunt  or  other  fortified  shelter,  and  such 
resources are too precious for any one wraith to hope to claim 
them alone indefinitely. 
Storm Warnings

It is known that Maelstroms are generated by catastrophes 
in the Skinlands, but that does not mean they always arrive 
immediately in their wake. Maelstroms have been known to 
begin hours or even days in advance of events in the living 
world, acting as grim omens as much as destructive forces. This 
means that a vigilant wraith is sometimes able to take action to 
protect the Quick she cares about from the impending disaster, 
though this means braving the dangers of the storm. This is 
no mean feat in even a smaller Maelstrom, and almost certain 
suicide in the face of a serious storm. 

Maelstroms have their strength rated in “Bells,” a refer-
ence to the huge storm-warning bells found in most established 
Necropoli. These bells only sound in response to an imminent 
Maelstrom, and the number of times the bell rings indicates 
the strength of the storm. This ranges from a single bell for a 
“minor” Maelstrom all the way up to an utterly catastrophic 
five bells, which spells certain ruin for all but the hardiest of 
settlements. 

Should the bell ring six times, or simply continue ringing 
continuously, it means a Great Maelstrom is approaching. Such 

an immense and overwhelmingly destructive storm is a force of 
destruction beyond human comprehension, and can very easily 
annihilate entire communities of the Restless. Should a Great 
Maelstrom arise during play, the Storyteller is encouraged to use 
the rules for a five-Bell Maelstrom as a starting point, but then 
intensify the storm in unexpected and utterly horrifying ways. 
Hazards of the Storm

While exposure to a Maelstrom can simply be presented in 
terms of damage, the Storyteller does not have to leave it at that. 
The Restless compare these storms to hurricanes and typhoons 
because that is the best reference they have from their living 
days, but the comparison misses an essential element. While 
the storms of the Skinlands are simply meteoric phenomena, 
Maelstroms are the product of very different forces. They are 
produced by surging levels of suffering, pain, sorrow, and ni-
hilistic destruction, stirred together with the dark energies of 
the Labyrinth and expelled through the chaos of the Tempest. 
Some sample hazards are included below to give an idea 
of some of the terrifying dangers Maelstroms can present, but 
this is by no means a comprehensive list. Storytellers should 
adapt these hazards or invent new ones as needed, especially for 
more powerful Maelstroms, which often reflect some elements 
of the tragedies that spawned them.  

Howling Winds
Maelstrom  winds  behave  much  like  the  winds  of  Skin-
lands storms in terms of battering structures and turning loose 
debris  into  dangerous  projectiles,  but  they  are  also  pose  far 
more insidious threats. It is not uncommon for wraiths to hear 
heartwrenching cries for help as the Maelstrom rages, and while 
some of them are genuine, others are the storm itself calling out 
for victims, or even Spectres riding the winds looking for fresh 
meat. No matter their source, these false voices serve only to 
lure wraiths out of safety and into danger.  

System: In order to tell the difference between genuine 
cries  for  help  and  false  pleas  generated  by  the  Maelstrom,  a 
wraith  must  roll  Perception  +  Empathy  (difficulty  5  +  Bell 
rating). Success means he can differentiate and react accord-
ingly,  and  is  immune  to  this  effect  for  the  remainder  of  the 
storm. Failure means that the wraith loses 1 Willpower as the 
cries eat away at his resolve, and he may take some action to 
investigate (though not at the expense of others). A botch on 
this roll means the wraith becomes convinced that he hears the 
voice of a loved one in need of rescue, no matter how illogical 
this belief might be, and ventures out into the storm to search 
for them unless he is forcibly restrained. He will also attempt 
to call out loudly to this loved one unless silenced by others, 
which can draw attention from nearby Spectres.

Freezing Rain
Though a Maelstrom’s terrible brute force presents great 
dangers to a wraith’s Corpus, that isn’t the only danger it offers. 
Some Maelstroms mix the raw negative energy of the Labyrinth 
into the storm, resulting in a type of freezing rain that leeches 

286

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

the Pathos right out of a wraith. Afflicted wraiths caught in this down-
pour must seek shelter or quickly become demoralized and aimless. 
Should they be caught in the freezing rain long enough, they can 
even succumb to a Harrowing.

System: During a scene where this hazard is active, roll half the 
normal damage dice for the Maelstrom. (Affected wraiths still roll 
soak normally.) Any unsoaked damage suffered is subtracted from 
a wraith’s Pathos points rather than his Corpus levels. Should the 
victim run out of Pathos points, remove Willpower points instead, 
with the usual Harrowing consequences if their Willpower points 
are depleted.  
Isolating Fog
A  Maelstrom  with  this  hazard  is  accompanied  by  banks  of 
thick, soupy fog. The fog persists even during periods of high winds, 
and seems designed to separate targets caught within it. Sounds are 
muffled and distorted, visibility is reduced to almost nothing, and even 
physical sensations feel distant and detached. 

System: When a wraith is enveloped in the fog, increase the dif-
ficulty of all actions related to navigation, locating things within the fog, 
or simple sensory perception by the Maelstrom’s rating (maximum 10). In 
addition, for each turn a wraith spends in the fog, he must roll Perception 
+ Awareness against a difficulty equal to 5 + Maelstrom rating, while the 
Storyteller rolls a number of dice equal to the Maelstrom’s damage rating. 
If the Storyteller scores more successes, the wraith is hopelessly turned 
around, and cannot make any progress in terms of movement. No matter 
how much he moves, he winds up back where he started. Naturally, this 
can present a serious danger in its own right, as regular storm damage can 
still occur while in the fog.  

Wraiths in direct contact with each other — lashed together, hold-
ing hands, linked by chains — may combine their successes against the 
Storyteller’s single roll. This hazard preys upon feelings of isolation and 
confusion, and so real connection with others actually makes it easier 
to navigate the fog. However, should the characters combine their suc-
cesses and still fall short, they must each spend 1 Willpower point. Any 
wraith who fails to do so is immediately cut off from the others, and must 
find a way to locate his companions if he wishes to gain the benefit of 
teamwork again. This separation occurs regardless of if the wraiths were 
holding hands or even tied together. More than one wraith has tugged on 
a length of securely tied rope only to have the end drop uselessly to the 
ground, or squeezed his friend’s shoulder only to find it is now nothing 
more than a handful of fog… or a Spectre. 

Naturally, Spectres enjoy hunting isolated targets in the fog banks, 
and may add the Maelstrom’s rating to any Stealth-related dice pools. 
Spectres  gifted  with  talents  of  mimicry  or  disguise  particularly  enjoy 
luring  targets  to  them  by  calling  out  in  distress,  or  pretending  to  be 
separated comrades. 
Searing Lightning
Lightning  strikes  accompany  many  Maelstroms  and  may  be  con-
sidered  part  of  the  usual  damage  roll  for  exposure  to  the  storm.  Some 
Maelstroms, however, bring a special kind of lightning with them, one 
that is an even greater threat to the Restless exposed to the storm. As 
the lightning flashes, wraiths in the area have bright, vivid afterimages 
of intense memories associated with their strongest Fetters seared into 

SYSTEMS

287

their sight. These afterimages are extremely distracting, mak-
ing it difficult to see reality through the haze of memory. At 
their strongest, they can cause a wraith to become lost in the 
memory as though reliving it.

System:  A  wraith  who  is  exposed  to  searing  lightning 
must roll her highest Fetter rating against a difficulty of 5 + 
Maelstrom rating. The Storyteller may lower the difficulty of 
the roll if the wraith takes measures to protect her eyes. Success 
means that she is able to shake off the memory flash and act 
normally. Failure means that the wraith takes a +2 penalty to 
all difficulties for a number of turns equal to the Maelstrom’s 
rating, as it becomes difficult to discern the past from the present. 
A botch on this roll means the wraith is not just distracted 
but actively retreats into the memory for a number of turns equal 
to the Maelstrom’s rating. She translates her surroundings and 
other characters in the vicinity into her memory as best she can, 
and is treated as stunned for the purposes of taking effective 
action. Each turn, she may spend a Willpower point and make 
another roll to attempt to snap out of it; if successful, she still 
suffers a +2 penalty on difficulties for the Maelstrom’s rating 
in turns as lingering images distract her. 

Haunts
Unquiet Places

hile the Shroud is a powerful barrier between 
the living and the dead, it is not immutable. 
Strong emotions can wear on it, creating 
areas where the two worlds are closer than 
normal, and where it is easier for the Restless 
to  reach  out  and  make  contact  with  the 
living.  Negative  emotions  such  as  fear  or 
rage do this most often, but positive ones can also alter the 
Shroud. These thin places become known as Haunts, and are 
places of importance to the living and the dead alike.

While the stereotypical haunt is a graveyard or an aban-
doned mansion, the truth is that Haunts can form anywhere. 
What matters is less whether teenagers dare themselves into 
spending the night there and more if the sheer force of emotion 
expended in the place has rubbed the Shroud raw. A cemetery 
poisoned with disdain and empty beer bottles can make a far 
worse Haunt than the basement of an old row home where once 
upon a time, a small child was locked in the dark by her friends.
Even the most skeptical of the Quick feel something “dif-
ferent” when they enter a powerful Haunt. Some experience 
the more traditional feelings of shivers down the spine, or the 
sense of being watched. Others feel sudden surges of emotion 
or flashes of times and individuals gone by, as if the history of 
the place were reaching out to them. It used to be that most 
people  either  shied  away  from  such  places  or  brushed  these 
feelings aside and went about their business, but now there’s a 
whole new reaction for the Restless to confront.

Celebrity

While a certain sort of person has long been attracted to 
places thought to be haunted, and amateur paranormal societies 
are hardly a new innovation, in recent years popular culture has 
become obsessed with haunted places. Reality-show film crews 
flock to any place where rumors of ghost sightings abound, and 
while clueless television stars waving electronics and shriek-
ing into night-vision cameras pose little threat to the Restless 
directly, the added attention they bring to a Haunt unlucky 
enough to be put on camera certainly can bring much more 
serious threats. 

Whether it is a little-known place or subject to worldwide 
acclaim,  however,  there  is  no  question  that  Haunts  figure 
prominently in the society of the Restless.  
Haunt Advantages

Wraiths guard their Haunts jealously, and with good reason. 
Haunts provide a number of powerful advantages and protec-
tions for wraiths. And these serve against both the perils of the 
Underworld and the intrusions of the Quick.

The Shroud
The barrier between worlds is thinner in a Haunt, making 
it easier for wraiths to interact with the mortal world there. 
The local Shroud rating is reduced by an amount equal to the 
Haunt’s rating, to a minimum of 4. In addition, the Shroud does 
not fluctuate at a Haunt as it does in other locations — it makes 
no difference if you’re visiting a deserted old cemetery Haunt 
on a bright sunny day or at midnight in the middle of winter. 
Other factors may temporarily lower the Shroud rating at 
a Haunt, though never below 4, but they will not raise it above 
its base rating except under extraordinary circumstances. Even 
then, such increases are typically temporary unless significant 
supernatural power is used or regular, devoted efforts are made 
to ward off the encroachments of the dead. 

While the mechanical effect on the Shroud may be the 
same from site to site, no two Haunts are alike when it comes 
to  how  the  Quick  react  to  the  nearness  of  the  Underworld. 
Most Haunts have a distinct feeling or sensation to them, a sort 
of “psychic signature” that sensitive mortals recognize almost 
immediately and even less aware individuals feel instinctively. 
This is also where echoes come in. 

Haunt Echoes
Haunts have reputations as eerie and intimidating places to 
the Quick, and not just because of their resident wraiths. Over 
time, particularly powerful Haunts begin to generate persistent, 
low-level supernatural effects of their own, commonly known 
as echoes. While resident wraiths can suppress these effects at 
times, echoes are not under anyone’s direct control. They are 
simply  manifestations  of  the  emotions  and  experiences  that 
have “soaked into” a Haunt over time.

If the reduction of the Shroud rating due to the Haunt 
level would reduce the Shroud rating below 4, it remains at 

288

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

4, but the owners of the Haunt may select one echo for each 
additional point that would have gone beyond that. A list of 
sample echoes can be found below. New echoes may be created 
at the Storyteller’s discretion. Echo effects should never imitate 
or replace Arcanoi use. While they do have certain game effects, 
they are primarily ambiance. 

Resident wraiths may choose to suppress the effects of an 
echo if they desire, either for an individual target or everyone 
present.  Should  there  be  disagreement  about  doing  so,  the 
wraith with the highest investment in the Haunt Background 
wins. In the event of a tie, roll the highest Willpower rating on 
each side of the dispute, difficulty 6, with the winner’s choice 
taking precedence. 

Note that echoes are only selected if the Haunt would reduce 
the default Shroud rating below 4; if other effects temporarily 
reduce the Shroud, these do not create new echoes. If an effect 
temporarily raises the Shroud rating, one echo is suppressed 
for each point of Shroud increase. The Storyteller determines 
which echo is suspended at any given time. 

Echoes do not apply to the Restless, only mortals. Supernatu-
ral beings are affected by echoes unless the description specifies 
otherwise. Echoes themselves do not constitute a violation of 
the Dictum Mortuum, though wraiths must be careful not to let 
echoes draw too much attention. 

Deadly: Sometimes it seems like a Haunt is simply out for 
blood. Injuries incurred in this location always seem to be worse 
than they should be, and even minor scrapes tend to leave last-

ing bruises or nasty scars. Subtract one die from all soak rolls 
made by mortals within the Haunt. In addition, the difficulty 
of rolls to hold one’s temper, resist taking violent action, or 
otherwise maintain composure in an aggressive situation are 
increased by 1.  

Forbidding: This Haunt gives off a palpable sense of menace 
that discourages casual visitors. Animals will not willingly ap-
proach the Haunt, and mortals must roll Willpower, difficulty 
3  +  Haunt  rating,  to  enter.  Each  success  allows  a  person  to 
stay for one hour before needing to roll again. Failure means 
that he must leave as quickly as possible, and will not reenter 
until at least the Haunt’s rating in hours has passed. A botch 
means he will not enter for any reason for at least a number of 
days equal to the Haunt’s rating, and will become hysterical if 
forced to do so. Hysterical individuals will attempt to flee at the 
earliest opportunity, and if prevented from fleeing, will cower, 
babble,  and  otherwise  be  incapable  of  constructive  activity. 
Supernatural beings receive a bonus on their Willpower roll 
equal to their Occult rating. 

Isolated: A Haunt with this echo is naturally overlooked. 
Even if it’s on a busy street where people pass it every day, nobody 
ever seems to actually notice that it’s there. Maps don’t list it, 
GPS devices don’t find it, and even following directions there 
often results in getting lost. Individuals simply ignore it unless 
they  have  compelling  reasons  to  visit  that  specific  location, 
and even those who actively search for the Haunt increase the 
difficulty of all relevant rolls to locate or notice it by 3. This 

SYSTEMS

289

applies even to individuals who have visited the Haunt — it 
is still just as easy for them to forget where they were going.

Jinxed: This Haunt is prone to bizarre accidents, sinister 
coincidences, and other moments of freakish bad luck. Once 
per story for each level of the Haunt, the Storyteller may visit 
some  ill  luck  or  unfortunate  coincidence  on  mortal  visitors 
or occupants in the Haunt. It is important to note that this 
misfortune is not something the resident wraiths can control. 
While these accidents definitely seem to “defend” the Haunt, 
they are unpredictable and can range from embarrassing slip 
ups to downright deadly accidents. They’re also unselective in 
their effects, as they can target Fetters or friendly Quick.    

Nightmarish: A Haunt with this echo provokes disturbing 
dreams and nightmares in mortal visitors, often ones related 
to its history. Reduce all Phantasm difficulties by 1 regarding 
affecting  sleepers  in  the  Haunt,  as  well  as  anyone  currently 
suffering a fatigue penalty (see below). A person who sleeps for 
more than a couple of hours within its walls must roll Willpower 
against a difficulty equal to 3 + Haunt rating. Failure means 
that she suffers a +1 penalty on all difficulties the next day due 
to poor sleep and distraction. This penalty is cumulative, but a 
successful roll reduces it by one. Sleeping in another location 
removes all penalties after a single night. Supernatural creatures 
may spend 1 Willpower point to negate all penalties at any time.
Obscured: An increasingly valuable trait in modern times, 
this  echo  makes  it  difficult  for  mortal  investigators  to  gather 
evidence at the Haunt. Batteries die suddenly, files are corrupted, 
audio is absent or distorted, and images appear either hopelessly 
muddled or so perfect they seem clearly faked.  The difficulty to 
break or tamper with such devices is reduced by 1, and each time 
an investigator attempts to capture evidence, roll the Haunt’s 
rating (difficulty 7). Success means that the evidence is somehow 
corrupted, or will be accidentally destroyed within hours of leav-
ing the Haunt. On a botch, that device is immune to this echo. 
Resonant: The Haunt radiates a specific emotion associ-
ated with its history on a subtle but powerful level. Mortals find 
this emotion constantly creeping into their state of mind and 
coloring their perceptions. Reduce the difficulty of Empathy 
and Arcanoi rolls related to that emotion by 2, and the Sto-
ryteller should reflect the Haunt’s emotional resonance in the 
attitudes of visitors, especially long-term residents or regulars. 
Supernatural  beings  may  shake  off  this  effect  for  a  scene  by 
spending a Willpower point. 

Slipping: A Haunt with this echo occasionally experiences 
slips in time — faces of people long passed show up in mirrors, 
old  conversations  drift  down  empty  hallways,  and  scents  of 
long-lost  meals  waft  out  of  cold,  dark  kitchens.  These  slips 
are not ghostly manifestations, but one-way glimpses into the 
past, though the past is not aware of the present, and cannot be 
contacted or affected at all. Slips are focused on those events 
and individuals that left strong impressions on the Haunt, but 
otherwise cannot be predicted. Sometimes the same slip will 
repeat, sometimes not. The general atmosphere of oddness means 
that the difficulty of Arcanos rolls at this location is 1 lower.   

Anchoring
Wraiths  who  have  lost  their  last  Fetters  and  thus  their 
ability  to  remain  in  the  Shadowlands  for  long  find  Haunts 
offer them a better foothold than nothing at all, if still a very 
temporary one. Add the Haunt’s rating in relevant time incre-
ments to any power or ability that allows a wraith to return to 
the Shadowlands, provided he does so in the Haunt. 

Note that this effect does not guarantee success on relevant 
rolls or replace the need to make certain expenditures. It simply 
boosts durations acquired by other means. If an expenditure of 
some kind is required to remain in the Shadowlands at certain 
intervals, that expenditure is still required for this additional 
time. Leaving the Haunt during this additional time immedi-
ately causes the wraith to vanish from the Shadowlands and 
reappear on the nearest Byway. 

Example: Smiles is in possession of an Artifact that allows her to 
return to the Shadowlands for one minute per success on a Stamina 
+ Enigmas roll. She rolls four successes, which would normally grant 
her four minutes of Shadowlands access, but since she used the item 
to enter a level-three Haunt, she adds three minutes to her time, for 
a total of seven minutes. (If she rolled no successes, however, the 
Haunt rating would not help her — it only adds to existing durations, 
it doesn’t create them on its own.) If her access time was measured in 
hours instead of minutes, the Haunt would add its rating in hours, as 
appropriate. Lastly, if the Artifact required Smiles to spend 1 Pathos 
every minute she wished to remain, she would still be required to 
spend Pathos for the bonus minutes from the Haunt.  

Maelstroms
One very important reason Haunts are so fiercely fought 
over is that they are some of the few places that provide real 
shelter against Maelstroms. To determine how much protection 
is provided, subtract the Haunt’s rating from the Maelstrom level. 
If this reduces the effective Maelstrom level to zero or less, the 
wraith is completely protected from the ravages of the storm so 
long as she remains within the Haunt — or no one breaks in. 
If the Maelstrom rating is not reduced to zero, the effects 
of storm will break through after a number of hours equal to the 
Haunt’s rating, assuming the Maelstrom lasts that long. Any 
wraiths still in the Haunt at this time take damage as normal 
for the Maelstrom’s effective rating, but may add the Haunt 
rating to their soak dice to resist the effects of the storm so 
long as they continue to shelter within what’s left of the Haunt.
Haunts also provide limited protection from the attention 
of Spectres during a Maelstrom. Provided the wraiths inside 
are  not  doing  anything  to  call  attention  to  themselves,  add 
the  Haunt’s  rating  to  the  difficulty  of  any  Perception-based 
rolls  of  nearby  Spectres  to  notice  the  Haunt  or  its  inhabit-
ants (maximum difficulty 10). If any Spectres do notice the 
Haunt,  however,  this  protection  is  lost  for  the  remainder  of 
the Maelstrom. Naturally, a wraith’s Shadow may decide that 
spotting a passing cloud of Spectres is the perfect time to force 
a sudden outburst….

290

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Overcrowding  sharply  diminishes  the  effectiveness  of  a 
Haunt during a Maelstrom. This can lead to some very difficult 
decisions if too many wraiths are trying to take shelter together. 
As a rule, a Haunt may shelter up to five wraiths per rating 
level, assuming the actual size of the Haunt can accommodate 
so many Restless. Concerning larger Haunts with lower ratings, 
however, this is not necessarily a question of literally having 
enough space as it is the mystical capability of the Haunt to 
shelter wraiths from the storm. Hosting too many wraiths taxes 
its protective energies. 

When there are too many wraiths in a Haunt for its capac-
ity, its effective rating is immediately reduced by 1 for resisting 
the Maelstrom. This penalty is cumulative. A Haunt loses a 
level of effectiveness each time a number of extra wraiths equal 
to its normal rating take shelter inside. So a level-one Haunt 
ceases to be effective with one wraith over the limit, a level-
two Haunt loses effectiveness every two wraiths over capacity, 
and so on. Note that if a Haunt runs out of actual space, no 
additional wraiths can be accommodated even if the Haunt 
still has effective rating left. 

No Haunt is strong enough to withstand a Great Maelstrom 
for very long. Should a Haunt be subjected to such a catastrophic 
storm, the protected time is halved, and the Maelstrom’s effective 
level is not reduced for the purposes of dealing damage when 
it  finally  breaks.  Only  the  sturdiest  of  Underworld  shelters, 
typically hardened for this specific purpose with thick Stygian 
steel walls, have any hope of warding off a Great Maelstrom 
for any length of time.

Injury

he living like to reassure themselves that 
the dead are beyond pain, but unfortunately 
if  there’s  one  thing  wraiths  understand 
better than the Quick, it’s that pain is most 
definitely  eternal.  Wraithly  existence  is 
something of a walking paradox — a wraith 
can find herself briefly discorporated by her 
child’s baseball passing through her, but at the same time shrug 
off a withering hail of Skinlands bullets with the same amount 
of effort. Even considering the weapons of other wraiths, the 
Psyche is incredibly resilient, and so Corpus can withstand a 
tremendous amount of punishment. 

Indeed, as anyone who has witnessed Moliate at work can 
attest, a wraith’s Corpus is less like the physical body it appears 
to recreate and more of a malleable expression of her Psyche’s 
emotional determination. In that respect, it has more in common 
with a suit of armor than it does with their former flesh and blood. 
As the Corpus is damaged, the wraith becomes more translucent 
and less distinct, direct representations of the fact that her sense 
of self is literally unraveling under the strain of abuse. In short, 
wraiths are tough because they must be — because when that 
defense they call their Corpus does fail, it means a Harrowing. 

DIFFERENT BODIES
Players familiar with other World of Dark-
ness  games  will  notice  that  wraiths  handle 
damage differently than mortals and even other 
supernatural  creatures.  This  is  not  surprising 
when it’s considered that wraiths are not living 
or even undead bodies, but expressions of their 
will to defy Oblivion itself. Players accustomed 
to other systems are thus advised to read care-
fully and be mindful of the unique qualities of 
the Restless Dead. 

Or, as some more cynical wraiths like to say, “The living have it 
easy — they only die once.” For the dead may find themselves 
torn apart and dragged to the darkest corners of their souls not 
once, not twice, but many times over the course of their existence. 
Each Harrowing risks returning slightly lessened; each time the 
Shadow’s whispering grows a little louder.  

As a result, it’s important to note that wraiths do not record 
or heal damage the same way the living do. Most wraiths are 
capable of suffering far more damage than the average mortal 
or even many supernatural creatures could sustain — the weak 
willed don’t last long in the Shadowlands, if they show up at 
all — and thus their systems for measuring and mending injury 
are correspondingly different.   

Permanent Corpus

There are two traits that determine how resilient a wraith’s 
Corpus is at any given time. Permanent Corpus measures the 
maximum amount of Corpus a wraith may possess, while tempo-
rary Corpus fluctuates depending on how abused or used up their 
spiritual body is at a particular moment. Temporary Corpus levels 
may never exceed the wraith’s permanent Corpus rating; any 
excess Corpus that might be gained from such infusions is lost. 
All wraiths begin with a permanent Corpus rating of 10, 
but this can be reduced by Harrowings, as the pull of Oblivion 
eats away at a wraith’s very sense of self. Permanent Corpus 
cannot be purchased with experience points — once it is lost, 
it is gone forever.

As a wraith is injured, the boxes representing temporary 
Corpus levels are marked off in various ways, as described in the 
“Types of Damage” section, on p. 293. A wraith with all of her 
temporary Corpus levels filled with marks is in serious trouble, 
and  depending  on  the  type  of  damage  may  be  immediately 
dragged into a Harrowing (or even a Destruction Harrowing). 

States of Being

As befits the fact that a wraith is as much a being of pure 
emotional energy as it is a “body,” things can become a bit fluid 
when it comes to what is going on with a wraith’s Corpus at any 

SYSTEMS

291

given time. There are five Corpus states: Corporeal, Incorporeal, 
Wavering, Material, and Harrowed.

Corporeal: The default state of a wraith in the Shadowlands, 
a Corporeal wraith interacts normally with other wraiths, but 
can also suffer damage through the Shroud due to the behavior 
of objects in the Skinlands.

Incorporeal: If a Corporeal wraith collides with a Skin-
lands object — whether it’s a thrown bottle, a passing car, or 
a bullet — and that collision would normally cause damage to 
a living person, the wraith instead takes a single Corpus level 
of bashing damage and becomes Incorporeal for her Stamina 
rating in rounds. This happens automatically; the wraith cannot 
choose not to become Incorporeal in response to such impacts. 
It’s important to note that this state can only be caused 
by an object that would harm a mortal — a curtain fluttering 
through the wraith as she passes won’t cause her to become 
Incorporeal, nor will rain or a casually discarded paper plate 
full of food. Even a person accidentally passing through part 
of them at a walking pace might not cause them to become 
Incorporeal,  though  a  person  running  certainly  would,  and 
the wraith would also become Incorporeal if they deliberately 
placed themselves in someone’s path. 

Wraiths can choose to become Incorporeal voluntarily by 
walking through a wall or a door. This inflicts one Corpus level 
of bashing damage and renders the wraith Incorporeal for the 
normal amount of time, and is the basis for how wraiths are 
known to pass through such barriers in countless legends. Note 

CORPOREAL STATES

Corporeal: The wraith’s default state. Takes 
normal damage from attacks in the Underworld, 
but becomes Incorporeal in response to Skinlands 
objects.

Incorporeal: A wraith whose form has been 
disrupted by contact with the Skinlands, such as 
passing through a wall or being “hit” by a mortal 
car. Takes normal damage from other wraiths, but 
is immune to Skinlands damage.

Wavering: A wraith who has lost all of her 
Corpus levels to bashing damage. Flickering and 
fragile.  Any  lethal  or  aggravated  damage  will 
provoke a Harrowing.

Material: Physically present in the Skinlands 
due to use of the Embody Arcanos. Affected by 
both  Underworld  and  mortal  damage  sources 
normally.

Harrowed: A wraith whose Corpus has been 
damaged so severely she is drawn into the deeper 
Underworld and a confrontation with her Shadow.

that this only functions with respect to objects and barriers in 
the Skinlands; Shadowlands items damage and impede a wraith 
normally, and do not trigger the Incorporeal state. By way of 
example, a bullet fired in the Skinlands would inflict only a single 
Corpus level and cause the wraith to become Incorporeal, but 
a ghostly bullet fired in the Shadowlands would inflict normal 
damage, and the wraith would remain Corporeal.

As described above, a wraith that is Corporeal but passes 
through a Skinlands barrier or suffers a collision with a harmful 
Skinlands object briefly becomes Incorporeal. As far as observ-
ers are concerned, her Corpus becomes hazy and transparent, 
though not to the point where she becomes difficult to see. 
While  a  wraith  is  Incorporeal,  she  is  effectively  immune  to 
damage from the Skinlands. Once this state is triggered, she 
simply cannot be harmed by collisions with Skinlands objects or 
attacks. However, she is still vulnerable to Shadowlands attacks. 
Wavering: A wraith whose temporary Corpus levels have 
been filled with bashing damage (see below) becomes Wavering. 
Their form is translucent and flickering, like a candle flame in 
a strong wind. A wraith in this state is treated like a Corporeal 
wraith,  except  that  she  now  suffers  two  bashing  levels  each 
time she becomes Incorporeal, as it is increasingly difficult to 
keep her Corpus together. In addition, a Wavering wraith is 
considered  to  have  zero  Corpus  levels  available  for  Arcanoi 
expenditures or other purposes, and is exceedingly vulnerable 
to suffering even a single point of lethal or aggravated damage. 
A wraith does not have to remain Wavering. Instead, they 
may choose to accept the Shadow’s offer and succumb to a Har-
rowing at any time. Choosing to succumb gives the Shadow 1 
point of Angst, but it goes into effect immediately, even if an 
enemy is in midswing. This is an exception to the normal rules 
about acting out of turn.

Material: A wraith can only assume this state through the 
use of the Embody Arcanos, though some whisper that other 
supernatural creatures possess their own ways of granting ver-
sions of it. Speaking only for the Embody Arcanos, however, 
this means a wraith is fully physical in the Skinlands, able to 
interact with it like one of the living. As a being of solidified 
emotional energy, the wraith does not suffer wound penalties, 
but can be injured by attacks, same as the living. While Ma-
terial, he does not turn Incorporeal in response to Skinlands 
threats. While in this state, wraiths are still subject to attacks 
and damage from the Shadowlands, but a Materialized wraith 
can attempt to soak damage from both worlds normally. 

Harrowed: A wraith whose temporary Corpus levels are 
filled with lethal damage, or who suffers a level of lethal damage 
while in the Wavering state, can no longer resist the pull of 
Oblivion and immediately descends into the deeper Underworld. 
Upon arrival, she undergoes a nightmarish experience known as 
a Harrowing, where her Shadow will attempt to assert control 
and draw her ever closer to Oblivion. (Full rules for Harrowings 
are presented on p. 240.) Assuming she “survives” the ordeal, 
her Corpus will re-form near one of her Fetters, typically one 
that was involved in the Harrowing.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

THE RULES OF OUCH AND EXCUSE ME

Trying to decide whether Skinlands contact 
warrants a wraith taking a level of bashing dam-
age and becoming Incorporeal can prompt some 
really weird table debates. The easiest and most 
important guideline to follow is the Rule of Ouch, 
which simply holds that if the impact in question 
is enough to make the Storyteller say, “ouch,” then 
it’s enough to trigger the Incorporeal state. Don’t 
actually test these impacts in real life, though — 
nobody  wants  players  lobbing  baseballs  at  the 
Storyteller just to prove a point! 

If the Rule of Ouch doesn’t apply, but the 
matter still seems hazy, then try using the Rule of 
Excuse Me. If the wraith comes in contact with 
something in the Skinlands, but a living person 
could simply have briefly stepped to the side and 
avoided them with a simple, “excuse me,” then 
it doesn’t qualify for triggering the Incorporeal 
state. Thus, a wraith won’t necessarily become 
Incorporeal just for casually brushing past a mortal 
on a wide-open street with plenty of space, but 
he will on a crowded subway where there isn’t 
any space for the Quick, let alone the dead. This 
rule never applies if the wraith deliberately oc-
cupies a space that is then passed through, or if 
something passes through most or all of a wraith’s 
Corpus. That’s just too much a reminder of their 
ephemeral state to ignore.

A wraith who survives a Harrowing that was caused due 
to Corpus loss re-forms with a number of Corpus levels equal 
to  her  Stamina  rating  or  her  permanent  Corpus,  whichever 
is lower. Note that she has no particular protection after she 
re-forms, and can easily be driven into another Harrowing if 
she  is  unlucky  enough  to  encounter  more  enemies  while  in 
this condition. 

Types of Damage

While  their  Corpus  differs  greatly  from  a  living  body, 
wraiths still suffer damage along the same lines as most creatures 
— bashing, lethal, and aggravated. It might seem strange that 
Corpus would react differently to different sources of injury, 
given its nature as emotional energy in a semi-solid state, but 
some learned wraiths have theorized it is at least in part due to 
the fact that wraiths simply remember some types of injuries 
as being more serious than others. 

In other words, even after death a wraith instinctively fears 
a punch in the face far less than, say, a knife in the ribs. And 
so even though the bones and organs that really defined the 

distinction in their living days are gone, their Corpus responds 
to their instincts, suffering less disruption from the punch than 
from the thrust of the blade.   

While some guidelines are provided, the distinction between 
bashing and lethal damage is left deliberately open so that the 
Storyteller can suit it to their needs. A punch is considered 
bashing damage at the hands of an average wraith, for example, 
but the Storyteller may rule that the punch of a scythe-fisted, 
Moliated  monstrosity  is  definitely  lethal.  The  one  thing  to 
remember is to be consistent and fair in these rulings. If some-
thing is considered bashing damage in one case, it should still 
be bashing damage the next time that same source comes up.
Bashing damage is damage that in the Skinlands would 
typically result in bruises, scrapes, and possibly even broken 
bones, but which is unlikely to be immediately lethal: punches, 
kicks, being struck by a fastball, getting hit with a board, fall-
ing a short distance, and so on. Bashing damage is indicated 
with a single slash “/” through the temporary Corpus level box 
for  each  bashing  level.  Unlike  lethal  or  aggravated  damage, 
a wraith is not automatically thrown into a Harrowing when 
their temporary Corpus levels are filled up with bashing dam-
age — rather, as more bashing damage is inflicted, simply put 
a second slash through each additional box, representing how 
it is becoming lethal damage (see below). Punches might not 
be as immediately dangerous as gunshot wounds, but add up 
enough of them and they’ll kill you just the same.

A wraith whose temporary Corpus levels are filled up with 
bashing damage enters the Wavering state, described previously. 
This is a very precarious position, not just because the wraith 
effectively has zero Corpus levels to spend, but because even a 
single point of damage from an outright lethal source immediately 
plunges them into a Harrowing. Even worse, a single point of 
aggravated damage in this state sends them into a Destruction 
Harrowing. Outright lethal is defined as a source which normally 
inflicts lethal damage, such as a knife or a firearm. 

Example: Jacob Pelkow has been caught preaching heresy by 
local Hierarchy heavy Malachai, who decides to have his guards teach 
the defiant wraith a harsh lesson. They begin beating Jacob, who has 
nine temporary Corpus levels, and in the first turn their punches and 
kicks inflict a total of six bashing levels of Corpus. Jacob’s player 
Sean marks these by putting a single slash through six of his nine 
temporary Corpus level boxes. The next round the struggling heretic 
takes another five levels of bashing damage. Sean puts a single slash 
through Jacob’s last three temporary Corpus level boxes, and since 
he still has damage to assign, he puts a second slash through two of 
the existing boxes, converting the bashing damage to lethal. Jacob 
also enters the Wavering state, as all of his Corpus levels have been 
filled up with bashing damage. If the attack isn’t called off or Jacob 
doesn’t get help soon, Malachai’s soldiers are going to keep converting 
bashing damage into lethal and send Jacob right into a Harrowing. 
What’s more, if one of them pulls a knife and inflicts even a single 
point of outright lethal damage, Jacob will also immediately enter a 
Harrowing, since he is Wavering. And if the blade is Stygian steel 

SYSTEMS

that inflicts so much as a single level of aggravated damage, that 
damage will send him right into a Destruction Harrowing.

Lethal damage is exactly what the term implies — inju-
ries caused by things that are designed to be or are capable of 
killing in short order: knives, gunshots, high speed collisions, 
wild  animal  attacks,  falling  from  a  considerable  height,  etc. 
Lethal damage is indicated by putting an “X” through 
a temporary Corpus level box for each lethal level. 
Lethal damage “upgrades” bashing damage as it is 
inflicted — simply add another line to make an 
“X.” If a wraith suffers lethal damage and all of 
her Corpus levels are full of lethal damage, she 
falls into a Harrowing.  

Aggravated  damage  is  a  particularly  hor-
rifying  form  of  damage,  one  that  poses  an 
immediate threat to a wraith’s very existence. 
Aggravated  damage  reflects  injuries  from 
sources so severe that they cannot be easily 
repaired, as they represent damage to the very 
essence of the wraith’s soul. Fortunately, there 
are relatively few ready sources of aggravated 
damage: weapons forged from Stygian steel; 
barrow-flame,  the  fire  of  the  Shadowlands; 
the crystalized Pathos called soulfire; certain 
Arcanoi, such as Outrage and Usury; Spectres 
with  certain  Shade  powers;  and  the  natural 
weaponry of vampires, werewolves, and other 
supernatural creatures, assuming they find a way 
into the Shadowlands. Aggravated damage is 
marked by completely filling in a box with a 
“*” or solid shading. 

In addition to the usual sources, the Sto-
ryteller may rule that any particularly severe 
trauma inflicts aggravated damage, such as a 
massive explosion or a tremendous disaster, but 
is cautioned to do so sparingly. If aggravated 
damage becomes too common, not only is it 
likely  to  start  an  increasingly  rapid  cycle  of 
Harrowings, but such familiarity also robs it of 
much of its associated menace and terror. 

If a wraith ever loses her last Corpus level to 
aggravated damage, regardless of any other types of 
damage she has recorded, she immediately plunges 
into the Labyrinth to face a Destruction Harrowing. 
She also enters a Destruction Harrowing if she suffers 
a single Corpus level of aggravated damage while in the 
Wavering state.

When a wraith suffers damage, unmarked Corpus level 
boxes are always filled up before any marked ones would 
be “upgraded” to a more severe damage type. For example, 
if a wraith with eight temporary Corpus suffers three levels of 
bashing damage, then two levels of lethal damage, she would 
have three boxes with a “/”, two boxes with an “X”, and three 
empty  boxes.  Only  when  all  empty  boxes  are  filled  up  with 

294

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

damage do the bashing boxes start getting upgraded to lethal 
damage (or worse). 

Healing

Though  pain  might  be  eternal  and  injury  inescapable, 
the mutable Corpus of wraiths also isn’t plagued by the many 
mysterious organs and systems of a living body. This makes it 
much easier to heal most forms of damage. 

Bashing damage actually repairs itself on its own, as the 
wraith’s  emotional  state  slowly  knits  itself  back  together.  A 
wraith recovers one Corpus level of bashing damage every hour, 
even if he is engaged in other activities during that time. Being 
punched in the face hurts, even as a ghost, but it’s still a lot 
easier to recover from it than being mauled by Spectral claws.
Example: Doctor Caleb Rapture is in the Shadowlands follow-
ing a mortal lover and goes Incorporeal three times in the process, 
incurring three levels of bashing damage. His player, Jaime, puts 
single slash marks through three of Caleb’s Corpus boxes. Assuming 
he doesn’t take more damage, he will erase one level per hour, and 
be completely healed in three hours.    

A wraith who has suffered lethal damage, or who wishes to 
heal bashing damage more quickly than every hour must resort 
to other options for healing their wounds. As the Corpus is itself 
a reflection of the Psyche’s emotional drive, a wraith may spend 
one point of Pathos to immediately regain two Corpus levels of 
bashing damage or one Corpus level of lethal damage. Unless 
otherwise allowed by special powers or circumstances, only a 
single point of Pathos may be spent per turn in this fashion. As 
long as the wraith has Pathos to spend and is capable of even 
a slight bit of concentration, she may heal herself. The Usury 
Arcanos also offers the ability to repair Corpus damage, one 
of the many reasons the Guild remains highly sought after (if 
not terribly trusted).

Example:  Caleb  approaches  an  unscrupulous  Reaper,  who 
pulls a soulsteel blade on the would-be Samaritan. He tries to drive 
her back, but she stabs Caleb, inflicting four levels of lethal damage. 
Caleb’s player, Josh, puts “X” marks through four Corpus boxes. 
The next round, Caleb spends 1 Pathos to heal, and erases one level 
of lethal damage. Caleb may still act normally as well, as healing in 
this fashion does not require an action.

As suits such terrible injuries, aggravated Corpus levels of 
damage are painful and time-consuming to heal. Aggravated 
injuries may only be healed “naturally” if the wraith Slumbers 
or Meditates for eight hours and spends three Pathos points. It 
costs three Pathos points to heal one Corpus level of aggravated 
damage, and only one level can be healed in this fashion every 
eight hours. 

Example: Madison escaped from the forges, but it was a close 
call — she suffered four aggravated levels due to contact with soulfire. 
It will take 12 Pathos and 32 hours of rest to heal it all. She can 
spread it out if she likes, but no matter what, recovering is going to 
be a long, costly process.

At the Storyteller’s discretion or the player’s request, ag-
gravated damage may even leave lasting marks on the victim’s 
Corpus, “scars” that must be cosmetically mended with Moliate, 
if they can be mended at all. This represents the fact that the 
trauma has made such a deep impression on the wraith’s Psyche 
that it has altered his self-image in a profound way. Note that 
some changes, notably Deathmarks and guildmarks, cannot be 
healed by any means.  

A wraith may also opt to heal damage by Slumbering. A 
Slumbering character must approach one of his Fetters and fade 
into it. In order to gain any regenerative benefit from this rest, 
he must remain Slumbering within the Fetter for at least eight 
hours.  Provided  he  does  so,  the  wraith  automatically  clears 
all  bashing  damage,  and  the  player  may  roll  the  character’s 
Stamina (difficulty 6). Each success heals one level of lethal 
damage. Any interruption forces the process to start over with 
no  benefit.  A  wraith  may  also  use  this  time  toward  healing 
aggravated damage, as described previously. 

Example: David Fogle, explorer extraordinaire, has returned a 
little worse for wear from his latest expedition into the Tempest. He 
currently has three bashing levels and four lethal levels of damage, but 
he doesn’t want to spend a lot of Pathos to heal. Instead he returns 
to one of his Fetters and Slumbers. After eight hours pass, all of his 
bashing damage is healed automatically. As for the lethal damage, 
David’s player Walt rolls his Stamina and gets three successes, so 
three lethal levels are removed. David has one level of lethal damage 
left. Walt could choose to let David stay in Slumber for another eight 
hours and roll Stamina again to attempt to heal the last lethal level 
of damage, or he can exit Slumber and heal another way. 

Sources of Injury

Wraiths can suffer as many forms of harm as there are ways to 
die, as well as a few methods unknown to the blissfully ignorant 
Quick. Some of the most common sources are described below.   
Regardless  of  source,  characters  facing  injury,  whether 
mortal or wraith, can make Stamina rolls (difficulty 6) to soak 
damage. Each success indicates that the victim suffers one less 
Corpus level of damage, or health level for the living. Note that 
some especially dangerous and potent sources of damage reduce 
or even bypass soak rolls. This will be noted in their description. 
Combat

The mechanics of combat are handled extensively in Chap-
ter Nine: Drama, but the basics of it boil down to the notion 
that every success on the attack roll inflicts one Corpus level of 
damage, which may be bashing, lethal, or aggravated depend-
ing on the source. Damage can usually be soaked, meaning the 
target is allowed to make a Stamina roll in response, with each 
success removing one level of damage. Remember that damage 
from the Skinlands, such as gunshots or car crashes, inflicts only 
a single Corpus level of bashing damage (or two if the wraith 
is Wavering) and forces the wraith to become Incorporeal. 

SYSTEMS

295

Stygian Steel

Most “ordinary” weapons in the Shadowlands are either 
relics or forged with soulsteel, and thus have no special properties 
when it comes to causing injuries — a relic gun or a soulsteel 
knife is still dangerous, of course, but “merely” inflicts lethal 
damage. Stygian steel weapons, however, are another matter. 
Supposedly forged from wraith plasm mixed with scrapings from 
the walls of the Labyrinth, Stygian steel weapons inflict aggra-
vated wounds on any wraiths (or Spectres) unlucky enough to 
feel their bite. Many high-ranking Legionnaires carry Stygian 
steel  weapons,  and  their  terrifying  capabilities  makes  their 
bearers formidable foes indeed.
Fire

Though the Shadowlands are a dank place, there is a fire 
all their own. Known as barrow-flame, Shadowlands fires burn 
deathly cold rather than hot, but they can still scorch or even 
melt the Corpus of wraiths. (Fires in the Skinlands can harm 
wraiths across the Shroud, but are treated just like any other 
source of Skinlands damage.) Barrow-flame poses no threat to 
the Quick, and cannot exist in the Skinlands at all. Any attempt 
to bring it over to the world of the living snuffs it immediately.
Barrow-flame tends to be found in places of great destruc-
tion in the Skinlands, and its appearance often presages new 
disasters. The Necropoli of Atlanta, London, Chicago, Dresden, 
San Francisco, and New Orleans, among others, are known for 
large, ever-burning barrow-flame conflagrations, though they 
are far from the only places with great concentrations of the 
unholy fire.

Regardless of its size, any exposure to barrow-flame can be 
harmful to a wraith. Each turn that a wraith is subjected to the 
flame, she must roll her Stamina against a difficulty determined 
by the intensity of the fire. Each success on this roll reduces 
the number of Corpus levels suffered by one, just like a normal 
soak roll. A botch on the roll not only results in damage, but 
also indicates some catastrophic injury has occurred, such as 
being blinded or losing the use of a limb. All injuries caused 
by barrow-flame are aggravated wounds.

Note that these rolls assume the wraith is doing his best to 
avoid as much exposure as possible and/or leave the proximity of 
the flames as fast as he can; if a character simply holds his hand 
in a flame or sits in the midst of a raging inferno, the Storyteller 
may increase the difficulty, add to the number of wounds per 
turn, or even disallow a Stamina roll in order to reflect the fact 
that the wraith is increasingly consumed by the blaze.

Though they are less commonly encountered than barrow-
flame,  soulfire  crystals  present  similar  dangers.  Made  from 
crystalized Pathos, they burn with a painful intensity, and can 
only be handled by wraiths wearing special gloves or Moliated 
for their own protection. Direct contact with a small soulfire 
crystal causes aggravated damage as though a wraith were in 
contact with a torch, while larger sources inflict correspond-
ingly more intense damage. With enough preparation, soulfire 
can  become  hot  enough  to  literally  melt  a  wraith’s  Corpus, 
inflicting horrific aggravated damage as the targeted is melted 
while still screaming. 
Maelstroms

The dread storms of the Shadowlands are sources of great 
terror for any wraith, boiling up out of Byways to wreak havoc 
on whole communities of the dead. As unholy mixtures of hur-
ricanes and the essence of Oblivion itself, it is no surprise that 
unprotected  wraiths  caught  out  in  the  storms  are  in  serious 
trouble — and that’s not even counting the attendant Spectres 
that are carried along with the storm. The Storyteller has the 
final say on how to adjudicate the effects of a Maelstrom, as the 
arrival of one and how the characters react to it is the stuff that 
great stories are made of and should not be reduced to simple dice 
rolls, but a rough set of guidelines is provided to give an idea of 
the scale of destruction that accompanies these ruinous storms.

Falling

Though it seems almost prosaic compared to more unusual 
and horrifying forms of injury wraiths may encounter, falling 
remains almost as dangerous to the dead as it is to the Quick. 
(Exactly why gravity seems to work on wraiths almost the ex-
act same way as it does on mortals remains a subject for much 
esoteric  debate  among  those  who  take  time  to  ponder  such 
things.) In fact, because falling is always considered Shadow-
lands damage, it’s arguably more dangerous than some showier 
threats — a wraith that topples off a building does not become 
Incorporeal, and so can easily suffer enough damage to send 
them to a Harrowing.

…and so on, to a maximum of 10 Corpus levels. Falling 
damage requires a Stamina roll (difficulty 8) to soak, with each 
success  reducing  the  damage  by  one.  This  difficulty  may  be 
modified by circumstance — if the wraith finds a way to break 

her fall a bit, for example, or is landing in a softer substance of 
some kind. Beyond 50 feet the difficulty of the soak roll increases 
to 10, and it is unlikely that much short of a supernatural power 
will reduce it, as the wraith is simply falling too far for much to 
be able to reduce the level of impact.

Falling through the Tempest deserves special mention, as 
many of the normal laws of physics are more like suggestions 
in that fluid place. Wraiths who fall through the Tempest are 
assumed to have reached a velocity of 60 feet per second squared, 
with corresponding damage. However, falling through the Tem-
pest into a Harrowing is more of a figure of speech than a true 
fall. While the wraith feels as though she is plummeting, she is 
in a different state of being and does not take impact damage 
when she finally “lands” in her Harrowing.

Transcendence

s dark as the Underworld can be, it is not 
without  its  own  form  of  hope  for  a  better 
existence. Some seek it in the fabled paradises 
of the Far Shores, but other wraiths seek it 
within. “There is another way,” these wraiths 
whisper, another state of existence that can be 
attained through great effort, enlightenment, 
and personal courage. They speak of virtuous wraiths who suddenly 
vanish in a bright beam of light, leaving profound feelings of 
happiness and peace in their wake. Though it has been known by 
many names throughout history, in the modern age most wraiths 
simply refer to this sort of fabled exaltation as Transcendence.

Legends abound concerning the nature of Transcendence and 
how to attain it, many of them as contradictory in their “truths” 
as the religions of the Quick are about the nature of the afterlife 
itself. Some seek it in austere denial of the living world, while 
others argue that embracing the life they once had is the only 
way to peace. Others urge the utter repudiation of the Shadow, 
while a dangerous few seek synthesis with their dark side as a 
means of escaping their current divided state. Indeed, scholars 
of  the  phenomenon  assert  that  trying  to  define  exactly  what 
Transcendence is a bit like trying to precisely qualify a notion like 
zen — it is a state that cannot be described, simply experienced. 
What makes this even more complicated is that possibly 
the only thing all Transcendence advocates agree on is that the 
process is a one-way trip. A wraith able to achieve this state 
moves  on,  utterly  and  completely,  to  whatever  greater  exis-
tence she has earned with her pains and labors. Some wraiths 
claim that the Ferrymen are actually Transcended souls who, 
Bodhisattva-like, have chosen to remain behind to help others 

reach enlightenment. This theory suffers somewhat from the 
fact  that  the  Ferrymen  refuse  to  comment  on  it  one  way  or 
another — and if they know the true path to Transcendence, 
they are keeping it to themselves. 

Still, despite the lack of evidence — or perhaps because of 
it — the concept of Transcendence hangs on, passed from one 
hopeful wraith to another like a candle in the darkness of the 
Shadowlands. Wraiths who begin to seriously study or pursue 
this state are known as aspirants or seekers, though whether 
these are terms of respect or muttered with a cynical sneer varies 
considerably. There are some that feel the very notion of the 
pursuit of enlightenment poses a threat to the status quo, and 
it’s not always the first candidates who spring to mind. 

Indeed, it is important to remember that Transcendence 
can be as terrifying as it is inspiring. Wraiths know full well 
the horror of finding themselves in an existence that they did 
not expect, much less desire. For many of them the notion that 
they would then rush blindly into yet another unknown state 
of  being  ranges  from  foolish  to  suicidal.  While  existence  in 
the Underworld can be difficult, it is not entirely without its 
pleasures, and in time a wraith can come to grips with how it 
functions.  Viewed from that perspective, gambling everything 
just for a chance at a mythical deliverance is almost impossible 
to contemplate, especially when the threat of Oblivion is right 
there every day. Some wraiths even wonder if Transcendence is 
another ploy of Oblivion, a way to get the virtuous to deliver 
themselves into its arms with a smile, only to find the same 
nothingness waiting for them on the other side of the light. 

As a result, though many embark on the journey few stick 
with it for very long, as they soon learn that even apart from 

SYSTEMS

297

Perceptionsany social pressure they might feel, the road they face is a long 
and difficult one. While the reward seems beyond price, the 
reality is that price will be paid many times over in ordeals and 
self-examination. Is it worth it in the end? Without evidence of 
what awaits on the other side, the idea of giving yourself over to 
another state of being — dying again, in a sense — is honestly 
terrifying for many wraiths. Only the Transcended would really 
know… and they are beyond asking.

But there is always hope.

The Calm Through the Thunder

While even steadfast believers will admit that it’s difficult 
to verify something as fleeting and final as Transcendence, the 
sheer volume of material on the subject suggests that something 
is at the core of the phenomenon. There are simply so many 
philosophical treatises, religious musings, witness accounts of 
successful Transcendence, and of course any number of con-
tradictory “how to” regimens out there for those willing to risk 
undertaking  the  research.  While  these  materials  frequently 
disagree on particulars, there are a few common elements that 
seem to persist in the majority of Transcendence literature.  

The most universal aspect is the notion of Transcendence 
as something attained after a great ordeal, or perhaps more ac-
curately a number of trials. For some aspirants, this is a matter 
of decades or even centuries, but there are also a considerable 
number of accounts of seekers attaining Transcendence after a 
much shorter period of time. There is no clock on enlightenment, 
after all, though those aspirants who succeeded in a shorter time 
also faced tremendous trials in their journey. As a result, it might 
be accurate to say that they didn’t take shortcuts so much as 
had years of ordeals compressed into a much smaller timeframe.
Another common element in many tales of Transcendence 
is the concept of purification, particularly regarding the wraith’s 
attachment to the basic elements of her existence: her Fetters, 
her Passions, her Corpus, even her Shadow. Some wraiths take 
this to mean a rejection of the “impure” aspects of these things, 
while others counsel acceptance of their roles in the wraith’s 
existence. Virtuous behavior is commonly extolled, but exactly 
what that means in the Shadowlands can be hard to identify. 
Mastery of the self also figures prominently, though aspirants 
debate whether this means the Corpus itself, the mind within 
it, or the higher self (i.e., the Eidolon). Regardless, most wraiths 
on the path to Transcendence will do their best to strengthen 
their  Eidolon,  seeing  it  as  both  their  aspirational  self  and  a 
bulwark against the temptations of the Underworld. 

At  the  heart  of  all  these  different  and  sometimes  con-
tradictory  notions  is  one  particular  set  of  volumes  that  has 
guided countless potential (and some say quite a few successful) 
aspirants throughout history. Known as The Tomes of Golden 
Light, these hefty volumes contain the accumulated wisdom of 
millennia of enlightened seekers, collecting witness accounts 
of successful Transcendence, philosophical musings, theologi-
cal discussion, and other lore of interest to potential seekers. 

Obtaining copies of The Tomes of Golden Light is often an early 
goal of an aspirant, as they are regarded as the single best “road 
map” to Transcendence for serious seekers. 

In particular, The Tomes of Golden Light are the source of 
common  Transcendence  tenets  known  as  the  Eight  Truths, 
which purportedly offer the most concise, direct framework to 
that exalted state. (Not that it makes it any easier to achieve in 
practice.) Most seekers memorize the Eight Truths early on, and 
slip in subtle references to these truths as a clandestine way of 
recognizing each other. Memorization is also a practical matter, as 
owning these texts is a criminal offense throughout the Empire, 
falling under the heading of “possession of seditious materials.” 
While many officials are content to turn a blind eye to a 
couple of otherwise harmless cranks, such laws allow them to 
crack down and impose harsh penalties if they feel idle preoc-
cupation is becoming any sort of a threat. They are also a useful 
tool for making scapegoats out of seekers if necessary — finding 
some proscribed literature on a suspect makes it easy to slap a 
cultist label on them, which in turn makes it a lot easier to paint 
a wraith as guilty in the eyes of the community. As a result, an 
informal network for circulating copies usually arises in any area 
where aspirants can be found in numbers, typically employing 
dead drops and other anonymous handoff techniques to limit 
exposure in the event of investigation. 

It is worth noting that there is no “definitive” edition of The 
Tomes of Golden Light. While the Eight Truths are constant, the 
underground nature of the subject and the hazards in making 
and passing on copies also inevitably leads to textual changes. 
Aspirants sometimes add their own thoughts and experiences 
to the text when making new copies, for one, not to mention 
discreetly alter or even remove passages they consider errone-
ous. All of this makes for an evolving body of work. This can 
also lead to heated discussions among seekers over differences 
in editions, or even how to interpret a single common passage 
found in more than one edition.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Enlightened Society

Given how difficult it is to achieve, much less document, 
many wraiths aren’t quite sure what to make of the notion of 
Transcendence. Most would certainly love to believe that there’s 
something  better  than  the  bleak  reality  of  the  Underworld. 
Given the effort even the most generous adherent feels it requires 
and the uncertainty of actually reaching the goal, however, it 
falls somewhere between wishful thinking and a fool’s errand. 
In the end, most are simply too busy with the day-to-day 
realities of their existence to seriously commit to something that 
might amount to an awful lot of nothing in the end. Like the 
afterlife itself to the Quick, Transcendence remains something 
to speculate about, but also something easy to brush aside in 
the face of the more pressing matters. And in the Underworld, 
there are always pressing matters. 

As one might expect, the official line of the empire dismisses 
stories of Transcendence as credulous nonsense on the part of 
wraiths in denial of their new existence. It is not a proscribed 
subject among the loyal citizens of the empire, but at the same 
time it is seen as a frivolous waste of time that could be better 
spent on the necessary business of holding back Oblivion. Dem-
onstrating avid interest in Transcendence will mark a wraith 
an eccentric dreamer at best, and a possible dissident at worst. 
This is no idle prejudice, either — many older figures in the 
Hierarchy have seen Transcendence cults spring up during their 
long existence, and know just how dangerous even “benign” 
fanaticism can be when it takes hold. 

Naturally, a large number of Heretic cults not only embrace 
the  notion  of  Transcendence,  but  are  only  too  glad  to  offer 
volumes of literature and glowing testimonials from believers 
who witnessed the ascension of one of their fellow members. 
Many  of  these  groups  are  true  believers  who  feel  that  their 
philosophy offers the keys to a better state of being, though 
there are certainly also cynical charlatans who simply exploit 
the  hope  that  Transcendence  offers  in  order  to  draw  more 
wraiths into the group.

Storytelling Transcendence

Characters or even whole Circles who wish to seriously 
pursue Transcendence present a Storyteller with tremendous 
opportunities for exceptional, in-depth roleplaying, but they 
can also seem extremely intimidating to portray as well. After 
all, most roleplayers are comfortable with fights and adventures 
and dramatic confrontations, but the notion of pursuing spiritual 
enlightenment in gaming may be new territory. 

First and most importantly, both you and your players need 
to accept that there is no “mechanical” path to Transcendence. 
While game mechanics will certainly be relevant during the 
journey, in the end there is no “and then you roll Stamina + 
Occult, difficulty 9, to become one with the universe and enjoy 
enlightened bliss forever” mechanic. Only sincere, dedicated 
roleplaying and character growth offer a chance at the brass ring.

PLAYING TRANSCENDENCE
There  is  no  one  right  way  to  play  a  char-
acter  on  the  path  to  Transcendence,  or  run  a 
Transcendence-oriented  story,  but  there  are  a 
few good do’s and don’ts to remember. 

Do respect that Transcendence is a difficult, 
long-term goal, and is not guaranteed. At the same 
time, if a player succeeds, don’t deny it to them.  

Don’t try to reduce achieving Transcendence 
to “being nice all the time.” It’s about a wraith 
confronting  hard  truths  and  making  difficult 
decisions about himself and his past, often with 
no clear “right” or “wrong” answer.

Do  expect  some  very  intense  roleplaying. 
Transcendence is not a matter of rolls and stats, 
but an intense personal journey expressed through 
roleplaying.

Don’t  let  one  character’s  search  for  Tran-
scendence push all the other characters to the 
background. Every character’s story is important, 
no matter their goals.

Another element to remember is that Transcendence is a 
long journey, easily a goal for a chronicle or perhaps two or three. 
(After all, if it was quicker and easier, it would be a lot more 
common.) Players should understand that it will be a difficult 
process, full of setbacks and costs and reversals. At the same 
time, Storytellers should avoid rushing the process, making sure 
when it does come up, it isn’t brushed off or reduced to a few 
die rolls and short interactions, or the players will feel cheated. 
One very good step to take is to sit down with the play-
ers  who  are  interested  in  pursuing  Transcendence  for  their 
characters — or in some cases, players whose characters seem 
to be heading that way even if the player didn’t plan it. Talk 
about what the players are most interested in exploring, what 
they find dramatic, where they see their characters heading, 
and what they are less interested in about the Transcendence 
process. This helps you craft compelling stories the players will 
respond to, as well as helping players recognize story hooks that 
are being baited for them. 

It is worth establishing at least some notion of whether or 
not Transcendence is a goal that can actually be reached — if 
a player honestly pursues it only to have her Storyteller spring 
a surprise “ha ha, no such thing” twist on her, they’re going to 
be justifiably upset. It’s one thing for a player to willingly agree 

to pursue Transcendence even if they know there’s a chance 
it’s not “true” in this chronicle — and there is a whole lot of 
dramatic potential if they know it’s not true and pursue it any-
way — but it’s poor form to deny them just to impose a facile 
twist.  Remember, what the player knows is possible is not the 
same as what the character knows, and nothing is guaranteed 
even if Transcendence is an attainable goal. 

Ultimately, Transcendence isn’t necessarily about morality 
as most people were taught it growing up, and if it’s religious 
at all, that’s more likely a happy coincidence than the recog-
nition of a deeper truth. Reaching Transcendence is not just 
about  always  picking  the  most  goody-two-shoes  answer  in  a 
situation. Portraying it that way — with lots of “tests” to see if 
the wraith always picks the saintliest response and punishing 
him if he doesn’t — will lead to a lot of player frustration and 
efforts to “game the system” by selecting the answer they think 
you think is “right” rather than what their character would do. 
Transcendence does seem to involve working to improve one’s 
better  nature,  but  that  can  also  mean  making  very  difficult, 
painful decisions that aren’t nearly so simple as “just doing the 
right thing.”

In short, the decisions a wraith must make on the path to 
Transcendence  should  rarely  be  clear-cut  situations  with  an 
obvious correct answer. If every choice reduces to something as 
obvious as “save this helpless kitten or push a kindly old man 
down an elevator shaft,” there’s no challenge and thus no feeling 
of real reward for succeeding. On the other hand, a wraith forced 
to decide between saving the life of his child or saving hundreds 
of souls in the Shadowlands has a much tougher choice to make. 
There is no right or wrong, just a decision whose consequences 
he will have to carry with him — but learning how a wraith 
faces such choices is the very essence of Transcendence stories. 
After all, a successful Transcendence story also means that the 
character  in  question  is  gone  for  good,  so  it  is  important  to 
make it a meaningful and challenging journey.  

Lastly,  don’t  forget  that  while  Transcendence  is  a  great 
long-term goal, it shouldn’t mean that the characters pursuing it 
are the only ones in the spotlight. Other members of the Circle 
should receive the same amount of attention regarding their own 
goals and roleplaying, otherwise the game might begin to feel 
like a special Chosen One and her sidekicks instead of a group 
of equals. Every player should feel as though their character is 
just as featured in the story, even if they are focusing on more 
immediate, less spiritual goals.

Just as there is no one “true” path to Transcendence for 
wraiths to follow, there is also no single “right” way to tell such 
stories.  There  is  only  what  works  for  your  chronicle  and  its 
characters. Don’t worry about what other games did, just tell a 
story that thrills, challenges, and moves your players, and you 
can’t go wrong.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Experience Points
Awarding Experience

xperience  points  are  a  mechanical  way 
of  representing  how  characters  grow  and 
change during a story, and provide a concrete 
way for players to track their progress toward 
certain character goals. Players accumulate 
experience  points  at  the  end  of  game 
sessions, and spend them to purchase new 
or  improved  traits  for  their  characters.  Different  traits  have 
different experience-point costs, representing that some traits are 
harder to learn than others. The “Spending Experience Points” 
chart (p. 302) lists the costs associated with various traits. Note 
that some traits cannot be purchased with experience points, 
or require Storyteller permission to purchase. 

Deciding exactly how many experience points to give out 
can be a difficult balance for a Storyteller. Awarding too many 
too quickly can lead to characters outpacing the threats they’re 
facing,  robbing  the  game  of  challenge  and  making  players 
complacent due to earning great rewards for little effort. At 
the same time, awarding too few experience points can lead to 
player boredom and frustration, as it makes even the smallest 
character advancements seem impossibly difficult to achieve. 
On average, Storytellers should award players 2-3 experience 
points per session. Players receive experience points for meeting 
criteria such as demonstrating good roleplaying, learning valu-
able information, or when their characters survive great danger. 
Guidelines for particular experience-point awards are listed under 
“Reasons for Experience” below. Storytellers may alter these awards 
or even add new ones to suit their chronicle if they wish. Keep 
in mind, however, that adding more awards means players will 
receive experience at a higher rate, which can throw off game 
balance. No matter what experience point criteria are used, 2-3 
experience points per session should be the standard.  

If certain players are never earning particular awards, the 
Storyteller should examine the criteria she’s using to make sure 
the players all have a fair chance to earn it. Having a profes-
sional actor in the group shouldn’t mean everyone else has to 
meet that standard to earn the roleplaying award. Likewise, a 
character should never earn zero experience points unless the 
player is disruptive and rude out of game — no matter how 
badly things went during the game, there is something to be 
said for simple participation and learning from one’s mistakes.
The Shadow receives 1/3 of the experience points that the 
Psyche earns, rounded up. Exactly how this Shadow experience 

can be spent is described in the Shadow Experience section 
below, while more specifics on the traits being purchased can 
be found in the Shadow chapter, p. 222. 
Reasons for Experience

One  Point  —  Automatic:  Each  player  earns  one  point 
per session, no matter what, unless he truly makes the game 
miserable for other players in a way that seriously impedes the 
function of the group as a whole. Such behavior includes but 
is not limited to such things as insisting on speaking in a silly 
voice all night, doggedly refusing to give up an argument about 
the rules, or constantly missing plot points because he’s playing 
games on his phone. 

One  Point  —  Leaning  Curve:  The  character  acquired 
some important information or learned a crucial lesson during 
the session. Making a mistake can count, so long as the wraith 
demonstrates that he’s learned from his error. 

One  Point  —  Roleplaying:  Entertaining,  moving,  or 
otherwise exceptional character-appropriate roleplaying should 
be rewarded with an experience point. Note that this should 
apply  to  quieter,  more  reserved  character  concepts  that  are 
portrayed well, and not just handed to garrulous or outgoing 
characters (or players) who tend to take the limelight. Groups 
are encouraged to raise their standards over time in order to 
encourage more in-depth roleplaying.

One Point — Circle: Anyone who goes above and beyond 
to make the game more enjoyable for their fellow players deserves 
a point. This can include providing excellent roleplaying during 
another player’s Harrowing or making a personal sacrifice that 
benefits the rest of the Circle.

One Point — Heroism: Not pointless stupidity. Not empty 
bravado. Not suicidal mania. Real heroism, defined as going 
above and beyond the call of duty — usually at dire risk, great 
cost or both — to achieve some higher purpose. Though subjec-
tive, as a rule of thumb, actions that qualify for this award are 
usually the sort that are likely to be retold multiple times after 
the session is over, because they are so inspiring, heartwrench-
ing, or otherwise notably impressive.

Spending Experience

Experience point costs for raising existing Traits or adding 
new ones are covered below. Note that permanent Corpus can-
not be purchased – once it is lost, it is gone forever.

Character DevelopmentEXPERIENCE TIPS

End of Story

Don’t purchase or increase a Trait if you can’t 
reasonably justify how you acquired it or what 
you did to improve it. 

Don’t dilute your character concept by picking 
up lots of random Abilities. It’s one thing if your 
formerly  mild-mannered  accountant  decides  to 
learn some self-defense after being beaten into a 
Harrowing, but it’s quite another for her to suddenly 
take up krav maga, jazz piano, computer hacking, 
dog training, and mime, just because you had some 
extra experience points lying around. Focus on your 
concept and what makes sense for your character.

Don’t,  as  the  Storyteller,  make  experience 
awards a competition between players. For example, 
the  roleplaying  point  should  not  be  an  acting 
competition with only the “best” performance of 
the night winning the prize, but a reflection of how 
each player portrayed their character that session.

Don’t try to create a perfect, “unbeatable” 
wraith  character  who  never  fails  at  anything, 
always has the right powers at hand, and is never 
remotely tempted or threatened by her Shadow. 
Perfect characters are boring. This is a game about 
grappling with flaws and weaknesses. Embrace it. 

Don’t  hoard  experience  points  so  you  can 
make huge changes all at once. Real improvement 
is  almost  always  gradual,  and  big  leaps  require 
equally large explanations or they seem unrealistic. 

Don’t, as the Storyteller, give out extra ex-
perience points on top of the 2-3 points normally 
awarded unless you feel players truly have earned 
them. Doing so every once in a while can encourage 
great play, but doing it too often dilutes the value 
of experience points and throws off game balance.

The end of a story deserves special consideration, as it marks 
the conclusion of a number of connected sessions. It also typi-
cally involves climactic events that will have a lasting impact 
on the characters and their afterlives. Think of the season finale 
of an ongoing drama series. Major secrets are revealed, serious 
villains are challenged, personal limits are tested, and massive 
undertakings  are  at  last  completed.  For  better  or  for  worse, 
finales change the characters and their world in lasting ways. 
It’s only fitting, then, that when a story ends, characters 
receive a few extra experience points on top of their normal 
session experience. This reflects what they’ve just gone through, 
and where they find themselves in the story’s aftermath. Many 
Storytellers also use this time to refresh characters’ Willpower, 
Corpus, and Pathos ratings, unless events will resume immedi-
ately from where the old story left off when the new one begins.
One point — Survival: It may not be pretty, it probably 
wasn’t nice, and it certainly wasn’t easy, but any character who 
survives to tell the tale gets an experience point at the end of 
the story.

One point — Success: The Circle succeeded in its im-
mediate task, if not outright then at least to some meaningful 
extent. So long as the Circle can claim at least a partial victory 
in its endeavors, it deserves this point.

One point — Danger: The character hazarded great perils, 
battled long odds, or took serious risks with important stakes 
hanging in the balance. A character who carries himself well 
during an especially difficult Harrowing also qualifies; after all, 
the stakes are arguably higher there than anywhere else. 

One point — Wisdom: Any character who exhibits ex-
ceptional cleverness or resourcefulness in the face of adversity 
can receive this point. Characters who had a major epiphany 
as  a  result  of  the  story  —  not  just  the  final  session  —  also 
deserve this award.  

One point — Shadow: The player did an excellent job 
portraying the Shadow’s role in the story, whether their own 
or another player’s (as suits the style of the group). This is not 
about “winning” as the Shadow, but rather about creating an 
enjoyable and challenging roleplaying experience in this dif-
ficult role. If the group chooses to have the Storyteller take 
on the Shadow’s duties for the players, this point may still be 
awarded to players who depicted the struggle with their dark 
side especially well.

If a player’s character is destroyed, removed from play, or 
otherwise “retired” at the end of a story, it is a customary courtesy 
to roll over the bonus experience she would have earned from 
the story to her new character. This helps ease the loss a touch 
and ensures that the player feels the same accomplishment for 
those climactic events as the rest of the group.
Shadow Experience

As a wraith grows and changes, so too does her dark side 
— after all, with new experiences come fresh mistakes to dwell

on, regrets to agonize over, and emotional turmoil to feast on. 
For this reason, Shadows receive experience points of their own, 
which can be used to purchase new Thorns with which to bedevil 
their Psyche or a stock of temporary Angst to fuel their malice. 
It is even possible for the Shadow to increase the rating of 
its Dark Passions, or even gain a new one over time. This is rare 
and typically tied to a major trauma in the wraith’s existence. 
A Shadow receives experience points at a set rate — one 
point for every three points gained by the Psyche, rounded up. 
At the Storyteller’s discretion, a single extra experience point 
may be awarded to the Shadow in recognition of truly excellent 
Shadowplay; not only does this reflect how the Shadow was 
particularly effective in that session, but also acknowledges the 
good work of the Shadowguide in question. 

Shadows may pay the following costs for different Traits:

Ability Training

Even the dead still learn new tricks. After all, if it’s one thing 
they have, it’s time. A wraith may purchase a new Ability or 
improve an existing one so long as it makes sense in the context 
of her actions during the story, and she can also reasonably justify 
suitable training in this new aptitude. Picking up the basics of a 
new Ability and rising to roughly •• or ••• worth of expertise 
isn’t usually too difficult to explain, but mastering the uppermost 
levels of an Ability often requires access to a formidable trainer, 
a large investment of time and resources, or both. 

Indeed, finding a suitable trainer to learn the highest levels 
of  an  Ability  can  make  for  an  excellent  source  of  stories  in 
itself, perhaps even involving tracking down legendary masters 
from the past who still dwell in some remote place deep in the 
Underworld.  Such  reclusive  characters  may  take  on  worthy 
students, of course, but tend to ask for favors in return… 
Mastering Arcanoi 

One of the most fascinating aspects of a wraith’s existence 
is the Arcanoi, the strange powers of the Restless Dead. While 
some  wraiths  delve  into  the  secrets  of  their  origins  and  the 
metaphysics of their operation, most are simply glad to have 
access to such capabilities given the dangerous, uncertain nature 
of their existence.

Though the Guilds might wish it were otherwise, it is some-
times possible for wraiths to teach themselves some Arcanoi 
simply through practice and dedication (reflected by experi-
ence points), though the player should still be able to explain 
where this desire comes from. Simply waking up wanting to fly 

is much less convincing than wanting to emulate a Harbinger 
he saw in action. 

Having a Mentor versed in the relevant Arcanos is use-
ful, however, as is a membership in the appropriate Guild. If 
conditions permit, the player may roll the relevant Background 
rating when trying to learn a new Arcanos (difficulty 6). Each 
success reduces the experience-point cost of the Arcanos by 
one, to a minimum of one.

A wraith may continue working with teachers to attempt 
to  reduce  the  cost  of  subsequent  levels  of  an  Arcanos,  but 
a  Mentor  cannot  help  the  wraith  learn  a  higher  level  of  an 
Arcanos than he possesses himself. A Guild can usually find 
a member with the requisite level of Arcanos mastery, given 
time, but the lower a wraith’s rank in the Guild, the more the 
Guild will require of him in return for instruction.

Regardless  of  the  source  of  the  expertise,  the  relevant 
Background-rating roll to reduce the cost of higher-level Ar-
canos purchases is made against difficulty 8. This roll cannot 
reduce the cost below half the regular amount (rounded up), 
and Willpower cannot be spent on this roll. 
Raising Attributes

Expanding one’s innate capabilities is something of an un-
usual matter for the Restless, whose forms are reflections of their 
self-image (and self-doubt) mixed with residual memories of life, 
and often manipulated by Moliate and stranger things as well. 
Improving Physical Attributes or the Appearance Trait is 
very different for the Restless than for the living. The physical 
capabilities and attractiveness of a wraith’s Corpus are based in 
self-image and confidence as opposed to external factors such as 
exercise or cosmetic surgery. Improving these traits is a matter of 
the wraith changing her perception of her capabilities in a lasting 
way. It’s also significant that improving Physical Attributes does 
not necessarily cause the wraith’s outward appearance to change. 
While a wraith might appear more muscular if she improves her 
Strength Attribute, nothing says this sort of outward change 
must occur. The disconnect between a wraith’s appearance and 
her actual capabilities can be very startling for Enfants, who 
are not programmed to expect a little girl to shrug off a knife 
wound or an old woman to casually kick open a heavy door.

Improving Mental and Social Attributes is a bit more like 
what a newly deceased wraith might imagine. Increasing Intel-
ligence might mean periods of intense study as well as review of 
material to develop memory and analytical capabilities, while 
raising Charisma might involve learning new techniques for 
approaching people and winning their trust. That doesn’t mean 
any of this is easy, much less quick, but a determined wraith 
can make it happen if he wants it badly enough.
Increasing Willpower

The Underworld is a crucible, and only the strong-willed 
survive for long. Wraiths may increase their permanent Will-
power by spending experience points. This can reflect the wraith 
drawing a greater sense of purpose from something that motivates 

SYSTEMS

303

her, or conversely the wraith internalizing the hardship and 
setbacks she’s encountered and turning them into sources of 
strength instead. Harrowings and other brushes with Oblivion 
can whittle away a wraith’s Willpower, making it ever easier to 
slide into Oblivion, so most players purchase more permanent 
Willpower for their character eventually. 

A wraith who spends her last point of temporary Willpower 
immediately falls into a Harrowing, so investing in additional 
Willpower is an excellent additional line of defense. And should 
something terrible happen and a character lose her last bit of 
Permanent Willpower, she is either sucked into the Void (if she 
has no Fetters left) or reduced to a pitiful Drone (if she does). 
Once diminished in this way, there is nothing that can be done 
to rescue the Drone; the damage is permanent. Some legends 
talk of powerful Artifacts or even the favor of a Ferryman as 
being capable of reversing a Drone’s descent into this state, but 
most wraiths dismiss those tales as wishful thinking.   
Strengthening Backgrounds

Players cannot simply purchase new or improved Back-
ground  Traits  with  experience  points.  The  wraith  must  first 
demonstrate why they deserve them through their roleplaying 
and  actions  within  the  story.  Given  how  deep  the  roots  of 
many Backgrounds run, this may take considerable time. Some 

Storytellers choose to simply award (or remove) Background 
points  to  reflect  changes  in  the  story,  and  do  not  attach  an 
experience-point cost for new or improved Backgrounds. 

Purchasing Backgrounds is allowed solely at the Storyteller’s 
discretion, and she may adjust the costs, delay acquisition, or 
even outright forbid the practice as she sees fit. Players who 
want to purchase or increase Backgrounds are thus advised to 
talk to their Storyteller and their troupe first, to see how they 
feel about the subject.

If experience-post costs are required, it is recommended 
that players spend 4 points to open a new Background, and 
then improve it at a cost of 3 x the current level. 

Passions

Given all eternity to contemplate their existence, it’s not 
surprising that wraiths sometimes change their Passions over 
time. Typically, this first begins to happen when a wraith starts 
losing touch with the Skinlands, as Fetters decay and their hold 
on the Shadowlands slips, and the wraith shifts her focus more 
to the Underworld. However, uplifting — or traumatic — events 
can inspire a shift in feeling at most any time, though given 
their power and resonance in the Psyche, changing Passions is 
more complicated for the dead than it is for the fickle hearts 
of the Quick.

304

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

OPTIONAL RULE: COMPENSATION FOR BACKGROUNDS

Unlike  most  other  Traits,  Backgrounds  can  easily  be  gained  —  or  lost  —  in  the  blink  of  an  eye. 
A  Mentor  might  fall  to  a  Destruction  Harrowing,  a  scandal  could  result  in  loss  of  Guild  membership, 
and  so  on.  If  the  Storyteller  simply  awards  and  removes  Background  points  once  play  begin,  without 
an  attached  experience-point  cost,  this  is  less  of  a  problem.  However,  if  players  are  spending  experi-
ence  points,  they  can  easily  feel  cheated  to  simply  lose  them  due  to  a  plot  twist.  This  also  discourages 
players  from  purchasing  Backgrounds  as  opposed  to  “permanent”  Traits  such  as  Abilities  and  Arcanoi.     
There are a couple of ways to approach this problem. The first is simply to let players know that points spent 
on Backgrounds are inherently at risk, and let them gamble as they will. Even if they can be lost during play, 
until they are removed Backgrounds offer some powerful advantages, and so players assume the risk of losing 
them in return for the benefits of obtaining them. This is the simplest way of handling the issue, though not 
always the one players will find most satisfying. 

Another method is to offer partial experience-point refunds for Backgrounds lost during the course of the 
story — half the value of the Background is usually fair. This allows the player to feel as though it was not a 
total loss, while still emphasizing that there is an inherent risk in many Backgrounds. Of course, care should 
be taken so that players do not suddenly spend a huge rush of experience points all at once if a powerful 
Background is refunded, so Storytellers should also consider a spending cap on large windfalls.  

Note that with refunds, compensation should only be awarded if events out of the player’s control force 
the loss; a player cannot simply callously destroy their own Mentor so she can recycle him for experience 
points. If the player deliberately abandons, destroys, or otherwise rejects a Background, those points are not 
refunded or replaced. Lastly, any Background losses suffered due to a Harrowing are never refunded or replaced. 
Oblivion doesn’t have to play fair.

Passions  are  not  only  motivations  for  a  wraith,  though. 
They are his most potent source of Pathos as well. Whenever 
a wraith experiences his Passion — that is, performs a relevant 
action and feels the associated emotion detailed in the Passion 
description — he can attempt to regain Pathos. The player rolls 
the Passion’s rating (difficulty 6). Each success grants 1 Pathos, 
up to the wraith’s normal maximum. A wraith may only tap a 
particular Passion in this manner once per scene.

At the Storyteller’s discretion, a wraith may also attempt to 
regain Pathos if he is near a mortal experiencing strong emotions 
of the same nature as one of his Passions. These “secondhand” 
feelings are much harder to tap into, however, making them a 
problematic source of Pathos. The player rolls the Passion rating 
against difficulty 8, and each success grants 1 Pathos. A mortal 
must be experiencing the same emotion in the same context 
specified in the wraith’s Passion — if the wraith has a Passion 
of “Show my husband I miss him (Love),” then not just any 
mortal experiencing love will qualify. Only a mortal showing 
his spouse he misses him in a loving way is eligible, as that is 
the specific nature of the wraith’s Passion.    

Passions are also tied to the wraith ability known as Life-
sight. This ability allows a wraith to read the emotional maps of 
human relationships, as well as potentially identify the Passions 
of other wraiths by observing how they respond in the presence 
of mortals demonstrating strong emotions.  

Gaining Passions

Like Backgrounds, players cannot simply purchase Passions 
with experience points, though spending experience points is 
usually part of the process of their acquisition. Adding a new 
Passion  or  strengthening  an  existing  one  should  be  strongly 
reflected in the character’s behavior as well as the events of 
the  ongoing  narrative,  and  it’s  advisable  to  discuss  the  idea 
with the Storyteller in order to make sure it makes sense for 
the story. Remember, Passions are not passing fancies or even 
strong reactions — they are emotional responses tied to the 
very reality of the Psyche itself.  

A player who wishes to pick up a new Passion or improve 
an existing one should invest considerable roleplaying time in 
their portrayal of this rising emotional investment on the part 
of their character. It should also make sense in the light of the 
character’s experiences and their goals — Passions are powerful 
but often inconvenient as well. They can cause wraiths to make 
dangerous or even downright foolhardy decisions  

Should the Storyteller permit it, adding a new Passion costs 
three experience points, while increasing existing Passions costs 
three times the Passion’s current rating.

WRITING THE PERFECT PASSION

Creating Passions that are both character appropriate and interesting to portray in play can seem like 

an especially daunting task, but it gets easier if you keep a few simple principles in mind:

•  Passions tell the Storyteller what kind of emotional roleplaying you’re interested in. If you don’t want 
a love story, don’t list love as a Passion. Think about the emotions that most interest you, and feature 
them prominently. 

•  Keep the phrasing simple and direct. A Passion should rarely include a comma, and never a conditional 
statement. If it’s more complex than that, you should either simplify it or break it into two separate Passions. 

•  Make Passions assertions and imperatives that inspire your actions, not passive observations or prohibi-
tions. “Do not allow harm to come to my children (Love)” is awkward because it doesn’t necessarily spur 
the wraith to act; “Protect my children (Love)” requires direct action.

•  Don’t be afraid of unusual emotional choices, as they can lead to interesting and unpredictable roleplay-
ing. “Make my wife remember me (Love)” is fine, but think about how much changes in the relationship 
if you try other formulations like “Make my wife remember me (Jealousy).”

•  Try not to focus all of a character’s Passions around a single subject or emotion, or your character may 

feel very one-dimensional and repetitive to play. 

• 

It’s alright to have two or more Passions that express conflicting emotions. A wraith could feel great love 
for his friend but also jealousy that now that she’s getting credit for work they started together. That’s 
the stuff of great drama!

•  Don’t try to create “safe” Passions. Even the nicest, noblest Passions could potentially drive your character 
to extremes. Trying to control that by making sure Passions are never dangerous or inconvenient misses 
their purpose, so just embrace where they may take you instead.

•  All Passions are powerful emotions. The rating is not necessarily a measure of how deeply a wraith feels 
the emotion; it is a measure of how important that feeling is to the wraith’s Psyche. A single-dot Passion 
is still a profound emotional connection; it just isn’t as vital to the wraith’s sense of self as some of his 
other Passions.

Waning Passions

A fire that can be coaxed to a roaring blaze can also be 
reduced to faintly glowing embers, and Passions are no differ-
ent. Without proper tending, Passions can wither away, leaving 
a wraith increasingly starved for both motivation and Pathos. 
If a Storyteller feels that a wraith is not addressing one of his 
Passions, she can make it begin to wither away. 

Passions weaken or die out in four ways. Of these four condi-
tions, only Resolution offers a wraith any real upside, much less 
any progress toward Transcendence. Losing Passions to neglect 
or the ministrations of Oblivion wears down the Psyche, while 
Resolving them brings peace and a sense of fulfillment. It’s the 
difference between giving your money to charity and having 
your wallet stolen.

Neglect:  Passions  are  powerful  forces,  but  without  con-
nection, eventually even these immortal longings will fade. If a 
Storyteller decides the wraith has been neglecting a particular 
Passion for too long — especially if he has ignored or outright 
rejected chances to indulge it in the process — then she can call 
for a roll of the Passion’s rating (difficulty 9). Failure on this roll 

reduces the Passion’s rating by one, while a botch decreases it by 
two. If this removes the Passion entirely, the wraith is immediately 
dropped into a Harrowing as his hold on the Underworld slips.
It is best to use this tactic sparingly, to remind players the 
importance of tending to their character’s Passions. A warning 
before use of this rule is not unreasonable. Perhaps the wraith 
begins to doubt their conviction, or feels distant from something 
that once moved him, prompting him to take action before the 
withering can really take hold. 

Harrowings: A Targeted Harrowing can attempt to weaken 
or eliminate a particular Passion, as the Shadow knows only too 
well what a powerful anchor these emotions are against Oblivion’s 
pull. Rules for Targeted Harrowings can be found on p. 243.

Numbing: Not all of Oblivion’s agents inflict bodily harm 
with tooth and claw. Some use a touch to infect a target’s Psyche 
with  Oblivion  and  attack  his  Passions  directly.  A  successful 
Numb the Heart attack reduces one of the wraith’s Passions 
(chosen at random) by one. If this reduces a Passion to zero, it 
triggers a Harrowing.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Resolving Passions

Given that Passions are powerful motivations for a wraith’s 
continuing existence, at first it may seem nigh-suicidal for a 
wraith to consider letting go of them voluntarily. There are, 
however, a few perfectly sane reasons that a wraith may wish to 
come to terms with these volatile emotions. While Passions do 
help anchor a wraith against the grip of Oblivion, that anchor 
also weighs a wraith down and keeps her from Transcendence, 
or so the seekers claim. Wraiths who wish to leave the Under-
world behind must therefore calm their hearts and moderate 
the  intense  feelings  that  Passions  incite,  or  they  will  never 
know the sublime joy that waits for them beyond this existence. 
Even if a wraith does not believe in the notion of Transcen-
dence, she still may wish to soothe these overwhelming feelings 
and desires. While a powerful source of Pathos, Passions can also 
spur a wraith into behavior he considers unsafe or unhealthy. 
They may even become a source of unbearable anguish if they 
were heavily associated with a Fetter that has been killed or 
destroyed, a constant reminder of what has been lost. 

Regardless  of  her  motivation  for  seeking  it,  however, 
Resolution is a goal that cannot be achieved lightly. Passions 
are  emotions  so  strong  they  literally  sustain  the  Psyche,  de-
sires so powerful they allowed the wraith to thwart the pull of 
Oblivion itself. Quieting feelings like those is no easy feat, but 
it can be done.

If a player desires to Resolve one of her character’s Passions, 
the first step is to discuss the matter with the Storyteller, in order 
to make sure that it can be worked into the ongoing storyline. 
This is especially true of four- and five-dot Passions, as they 
represent emotional cornerstones of the wraith’s creation and 
ongoing existence (though it’s worth noting that even “mere” 
one- and two-dot Passions still represent emotional drives as 
powerful as the most intense feelings of the Quick). Resolution 
will require the character spend time contemplating her chang-
ing feelings, making peace with herself (and possibly others) 
regarding the nature of the Passion.

Though it is far from a perfect analogy, it is possible to 
compare Resolving a Passion to ending a long-term romantic 
relationship. Even if it is right, even if it is logical, even if it 
is amicable and mutually agreed upon — indeed, even if it is 
absolutely necessary — the heart still resists cutting ties com-
pletely. For better or worse, those feelings have been a major 
part of your life for a long time, something that motivated you 
and gave you a sense of identity, and walking away from that 
can be a terrifying experience. Part of you is gone and you need 
to redefine yourself, find new motivations and new reasons for 
living. Add on all the heartache, doubt, and regret that often 
accompany such changes, all of which make excellent fodder 
for a Shadow’s whispering, and you begin to understand the 
difficulty wraiths have in approaching the idea of Resolution.  
System: After the player has spent a suitable amount of 
time roleplaying her wraith’s coming to terms with her emotions, 

the Storyteller requests a roll to weaken the Passion in question. 
The wraith must roll the rating of the Passion (difficulty 9), 
with each success reducing the Passion’s rating by one. A pas-
sion cannot be reduced to zero in this fashion, however — that 
requires a Resolution roll, as outlined below. It is not necessary 
to reduce a Passion to a one-point rating in order to attempt 
Resolution, though as a rule of thumb it should be reduced to at 
least half of its original rating (rounded down, with a minimum 
of one) before any attempt is made.

When the Storyteller feels that the character has come to 
grips with her Passion and is ready to finally walk away from it, 
the player may make a Resolution roll. This requires a Willpower 
roll against a difficulty equal to the Passion’s original rating +4. 
If the wraith achieves successes on the roll equal to the Passion’s 
original rating, she succeeds in reaching Resolution and may 
remove the Passion from her sheet. This has no mechanical 
benefit, but is considered an important step for those wraiths 
interested in Transcendence, and can ease the path to that goal.
If the wraith fails the Resolution roll, the Passion’s rating 
increases by one, as the wraith finds herself not only unable to 
sever her ties but all the more invested in her emotions. Re-
member, Passions are deeply tied into the core of the Psyche’s 
continuing existence, and so attempting to remove one can 
sometimes have the effect of making the Psyche cling to it that 
much tighter. A wraith that botches a Resolution roll is imme-
diately drawn into a Destruction Harrowing; instead of finding 
peaceful acceptance, she has opened her heart to the numbing 
cold of Oblivion, and must find some way to close the wound 
before it consumes her. Should she survive this Harrowing, the 
Passion’s rating is increased by one, and the wraith is not able 
to attempt to Resolve it again. 

If a player attempting Resolution uses the Passion in ques-
tion to regain Pathos at any point, doing so should set back 
their efforts in some significant way. (If a mechanic is required, 
delaying any Resolution progress for a number of sessions equal 
to the Pathos gained is a start.) To return to the above relation-
ship analogy, tapping a Passion that the wraith is attempting to 
Resolve is like going on a date with their former lover — it’s 
only going to make it harder to move on.

Fetters

As the people and places that exerted such a hold on a 
wraith that they helped allow her to stave off Oblivion itself, 
but also sources of worry that frequently require her attention, 
Fetters naturally occupy a conflicted place in the hearts of most 
wraiths. Without them, a wraith is denied all but the briefest 
of visits to the Shadowlands, not to mention a safe place to 
rest and recuperate. But protecting them is a source of great 
worry and frequent hardship, and losing one triggers a fast trip 
to a Harrowing. 

Fetters are the physical reminders of unfinished business 
and things left behind, and sooner or later a wraith must find 
a way to Resolve what they mean and put them behind her. If 

SYSTEMS

307

not, she may find them ripped away without warning, denying 
her the chance to make her peace forever. 

One of the primary benefits to maintaining Fetters is being 
able to visit the Shadowlands. A wraith with Fetters may remain 
in the Shadowlands indefinitely; temporary Fetters created by 
Lifeweb allow a wraith to remain for as long as those Fetters 
last. There are also rumors of certain Artifacts that allow their 
owners to visit the Shadowlands, but if such treasures exist, 
they are jealously guarded.  

A wraith with no Fetters must spend 1 Willpower point for 
every scene he wishes to remain in the Shadowlands. If he does 
not exit the Shadowlands under his own power when his time 
expires, he is drawn into the nearest Byway. This duration may 
be extended if a wraith successfully Resolves a Fetter (see below).
As a solid tie to their old life, a Fetter’s presence also naturally 
strengthens a wraith’s resolve. At the end of any scene where a 
wraith significantly interacts with one of his Fetters, the player 
may roll the Fetter’s rating (difficulty 6). Each success restores 
1 Willpower point, up the character’s maximum. If the wraith 
interacted with more than one Fetter, roll each one separately. 
Wraiths with unresolved Fetters are at a disadvantage in 
the deeper Underworld. Distracted by the tug of their Fetters, 
they are at +1 difficulty to all rolls in the Tempest and +2 dif-
ficulty to all rolls in the Labyrinth 

Lastly,  wraiths  also  regain  Willpower  more  quickly  if 
they Slumber in a Fetter. For every eight-hour period a wraith 
Slumbers, the player may roll the Fetter’s rating (difficulty 4). 
Each success restores 1 Willpower point, up to the character’s 
normal maximum.
Losing Fetters

As difficult as they are to obtain, Fetters are only too easy 
to lose. Unlike Passions, which are internal expressions of the 
Psyche, Fetters not only exist independently of the wraith but are 
contingent on weathering all the malice, stupidity, and simple 
bad luck of the Skinlands for their continued existence. With 
that in mind, it’s no small wonder wraiths guard their Fetters so 
jealously, and woe betide any mortal who dares pose a threat. 
The Quick aren’t the only threat to Fetters. Other wraiths 
know exactly how powerful Fetters are, as well as the disastrous 
consequences of losing them. Even accidental destruction of 
a Fetter is a serious offense, and a deliberate attack is one of 
the most heinous crimes known to the Restless. That doesn’t 
mean it doesn’t happen, of course, but it does mean an attacker 
tends to work as indirectly as possible in order to make it hard 
to trace back to her. Wraiths known to attack Fetters are the 
most notorious sort of criminal in the Underworld, and if they 
are captured can expect harsh justice even by Stygian standards.
Revealing a Fetter to another wraith is thus a profound 
gesture of trust. Having others helping you makes protecting 
and maintaining Fetters easier, but even in close-knit Circles it 
is not unusual for members to “hold back” a Fetter or two from 
their comrades. While a wraith may trust his friends implicitly, 

their Shadows also know anything he tells them. That thought 
alone is enough to make even trusting wraiths cautious; not 
telling  all  ensures  that  should  one  of  his  friends  fall  to  her 
Shadow, she cannot threaten all of his Fetters.

As noted previously, a wraith with no remaining Fetters can 
only remain in the Shadowlands for a very brief period of time. 
This time is slightly longer for wraiths who have Resolved at 
least one of their Fetters, but in the long term a wraith without 
Fetters must find a different place to dwell. The Shadowlands 
simply can’t be his home anymore.  

Destruction:  Nothing in the Skinlands lasts forever. A 
wraith  is  immediately  drawn  into  a  Harrowing  if  one  of  his 
Fetters is killed or destroyed, and the corresponding Trait is 
erased from the character sheet. Needless to say, deliberately 
endangering or destroying another wraith’s Fetter is one of the 
most vile acts known to the Restless, and one can be sure of a 
terrible and lasting enmity on the part of the wronged party. 
That is, assuming she returns from the Harrowing….

OPTIONAL RULE: THE SHIP OF THESEUS

A  classic  thought  experiment,  the  Ship  of 
Theseus asks the following question: How much 
of an object can you change or replace before it 
stops  being  the  same  object?  This  is  especially 
pertinent for wraiths with object Fetters such as 
houses or cars — while burning down the house 
or totaling the car definitely destroys the Fetter, 
it  is  also  arguable  that  completely  renovating 
the house or overhauling the car could result in 
it  no  longer  being  the  same  object  the  wraith 
was attached to when she died. After all, many 
haunted-house  stories  begin  when  the  owners 
start extensive additions or renovations. A wraith 
venting her fury at those responsible for “damag-
ing” her Fetter in this fashion could very well be 
the basis for such tales. 

The Storyteller may invoke this rule to re-
duce a Fetter’s rating if an object has changed in 
a profound way, particularly if that change goes 
against the essence of what the object was at the 
time of the wraith’s death. This should only be 
used for extensive alterations. Simply painting 
a  house  or  changing  the  furniture  should  not 
damage  the  Fetter,  but  gutting  it,  completely 
reworking the floor plan, and tacking on an ad-
dition where the wraith’s old rose garden used to 
be would qualify. This rule should not reduce a 
Fetter rating to zero — even if it looks completely 
different, if the house is still standing there is still 
some tie — and this rule only applies to object 
Fetters, not living ones. 

308

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Neglect: A wraith may distance herself from a Fetter — 
or  find  herself  unable  to  attend  to  it  due  to  external  forces 
restraining her from doing so — and thus feel her connection 
to it weaken. Neglect should not come into play due to a brief 
interlude, but as a result of extended separation or the wraith 
deliberately choosing not to attend to her Fetter at a critical 
time. The choice about when it applies is entirely up to the 
Storyteller.  Should  it  be  necessary  to  check  for  neglect,  the 
Storyteller rolls the wraith’s Fetter rating (difficulty 9). Failure 
decreases the Fetter’s rating by one, while a botch drops it by 
two. If this reduces the rating to zero, the wraith is immediately 
thrust into a Harrowing. 

Harrowings: Targeted Harrowings can reduce a Fetter’s rat-
ing or even remove the attachment entirely, severing one more 
tie between the wraith and the Skinlands. Rules for Targeted 
Harrowings can be found on p. 243.

Rending:  Using  the  Rend  the  Lifeweb  power,  certain 
Spectres are capable of attacking or even destroying a wraith’s 
Fetter directly. A successful attack with this power reduces a 
Fetter rating by one, and will force a wraith into a Harrowing 
if this reduces a Fetter’s rating to zero. For more on Rend the 
Lifeweb, see p. 360.

Resolution: See below. 

Acquiring Fetters

It is rare that a wraith develops a deep-enough level of at-
tachment to some new person or thing in the Skinlands to create 
a true Fetter, but it is not impossible. A wraith closely tied to 
a man might become equally protective of his newborn child, 
for example, or find that after death she is especially attached 
to a place she never really appreciated in life. Purchasing a new 
Fetter or improving an existing one is not simply a matter of 
spending experience points, however, and forging this depth 
of connection requires both Storyteller approval and extensive 
roleplaying and character investment during the story. 

Players are advised to work with their Storyteller extensively 
to figure out how to justify a new Fetter, and should remember 
that new and improved Fetters are granted entirely at the Sto-
ryteller’s discretion. Assuming the Storyteller approves of the 
new Fetter, the experience-point cost required is three times the 
desired rating. This must be paid all at once, not built up slowly 
over time, and it is thus advised that the player begin saving 
experience points while he is building up to the acquisition of 
the new Fetter through the events of the story. 

SYSTEMS

309

Resolving Fetters

While Fetters provide a means for a wraith to remain in 
the Shadowlands, like Passions they also represent some deep 
attachment or unfinished business that is responsible for the 
wraith winding up in the Underworld in the first place. Despite 
the fact that many wraiths are fearful and hesitant at the notion 
of Resolving their Passions, the notion that a wraith should 
work to Resolve their Fetters is considerably more accepted, 
and not just by adherents of Transcendence.  

After all, mortal Fetters will certainly die one day, and even 
the most durable-seeming object Fetter is still at the mercy of 
the wear and tear of the Skinlands. More than one wraith who 
thought their Fetter would stand the test of ages has howled 
in despair as war, disaster, or sheer mischance consigned it to 
the ash heap. If a wraith does not make the effort to Resolve 
a Fetter, sooner or later it will be ripped from her, and she will 
never be able to make peace with it. That’s a heavy burden to 
carry over the course of eternity. 

Much like Resolving a Passion, coming to terms with a 
wraith’s attachment to a Fetter and Resolving it requires discus-
sion with the Storyteller about working it into the story. It also 
requires intense roleplaying wherein the wraith confronts her 
connection to the Fetter and finds a way to walk away from it 

on her own terms. Though the exact details of this process vary 
widely, ultimately Resolution comes from being able to leave 
the Fetter behind without regret. 

Players who are interested in Resolving a Fetter can think 
about it in terms of what it would take for them to walk away 
from an important part of their life, whether it’s their childhood 
home,  a  beloved  piece  of  heirloom  jewelry,  or  even  contact 
with a loved one. What would it take to be able to just walk 
away — without anger, without sorrow, without regrets, and 
without ever looking back? The answer is seldom simple and 
straightforward, especially when the extreme passions of the 
Restless are taken into account.

System: At any time the Storyteller feels the player has dem-
onstrated sufficient progress in her desire to Resolve a Fetter, the 
player may make a roll of the Fetter’s rating, at difficulty 9. Every 
two successes reduce the Fetter’s rating by one, to a minimum of 
one. A Fetter cannot be completely eliminated in this fashion 
— that requires a Resolution roll, outlined below — but a Fetter 
must be reduced to at least half of its original rating, rounded down 
(to a minimum of one), before a final Resolution roll is possible.
Once the Storyteller feels that the character is ready to 
finally Resolve her Fetter, it is time for a Resolution roll. This is 
a moment of great risk, not just for the wraith but for her Fetter 
as well — severing such a critical connection invites the atten-

310

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

tion of Oblivion, and even a moment of doubt can destroy both 
wraith and subject. A Resolution roll consists of the wraith’s 
Willpower against a difficulty of 4 + the Fetter’s original rating. 
If the wraith gains successes on this roll equal to the Fetter’s 
original rating, she has Resolved the Fetter successfully. 

If the wraith fails a Resolution roll, the rating of her Fet-
ter increases by one, and she must undergo another period of 
searching  and  reflection  before  attempting  Resolution  again. 
If a wraith botches a Resolution roll, the Fetter is immediately 
destroyed. A living Fetter dies suddenly, and often without ap-
parent cause, while an inanimate Fetter is consumed in some 
freak accident or misfortune. (In the unusual event that a living 
Fetter is another player’s character, death is not automatic, but he 
should be confronted by a life-threatening crisis that is difficult 
to overcome, and the Fetter rating is lost regardless.) As for the 
wraith, she immediately falls into a Destruction Harrowing. Should 
she survive, she will still have to face the damage she has done.
A Storyteller may grant bonus dice to rolls related to Re-
solving a Fetter, or even the Resolution roll itself, as a reward 
for  exceptional  roleplaying  and  dedication  to  the  process  of 
Resolution. However, the final moment of Resolution should 
always be handled as a dice roll, and not simply awarded outright. 
As outlined above, there is a very real risk to both the wraith 
and her Fetter at that critical moment, and automatic success 
(or failure) removes that risk. Even the best-prepared wraith 
with the noblest of intentions can still falter at that critical 
moment, but for those who risk it, the reward of being a step 
closer to Transcendence is well worth it.

In addition to progress toward Transcendence, Resolving a 
Fetter also makes it easier to remain in the Shadowlands even 
when other ties have been lost. If a wraith has no remaining 
Fetters, but successfully Resolved at least one Fetter in the past, 
he may remain in the Shadowlands for one day per Willpower 
point spent rather than one scene per point as normal. Sup-
posedly, a wraith who manages to Resolve all of his Fetters can 
remain  in  the  Shadowlands  indefinitely,  but  if  such  success 
bestows this benefit, it is rare to the point of myth.   
The Sleep of the Dead

Even the dead still sleep, after a fashion. They do not require 
it the same way that mortals do, though it does offer a respite 
from the hardships of their existence. Referred to as Slumber, 
this state is first and foremost a restorative one for an injured 
wraith. A wraith in Slumber can heal all but the most grievous 
wounds, provided she has had the time to rest. See the Injury 
section on p. 295 for details on how Slumber aids in healing. 
A wraith who still has active Fetters can only Slumber by 
traveling to a Fetter and melding into it, a process which takes 
approximately as long as a mortal falling asleep and requires a 
similar amount of quiet and relative inactivity. The size of the 
Fetter does not matter, and entering Slumber does not require 
Skinriding  a  living  Fetter;  simple  proximity  is  enough.  This 
merger offers a measure of protection, as a Slumbering wraith 
cannot be harmed directly and is easy to overlook. Other wraiths 

and mortals sensitive to the dead may make a Perception + 
Awareness roll, difficulty 7, to catch a glimpse of the wraith 
within the Fetter, but most never think to look. If the Fetter 
suffers at least one level of damage, the wraith is immediately 
ejected, suffers one lethal Corpus level, and is considered stunned 
for one round if she returns in a combat situation. 

Slumbering in a Fetter does not protect the wraith against 
a Maelstrom. Those who Slumber too long or simply suffer poor 
timing may find themselves ejected right into a howling storm. A 
wraith has no awareness of her surroundings while Slumbering, 
and any external circumstances that normally force her into a 
Harrowing (such as the destruction of another Fetter) will still 
wrench her free and down into the Harrowing as per normal. 
A wraith with no remaining Fetters, who did not Resolve 
all of those Fetters, can still Slumber. She simply finds a place 
to rest and enters a dormant state, which temporarily diffuses 
her Corpus in such a way that she essentially disappears. She is 
otherwise treated the same as Slumbering in a Fetter, as above, 
and is ejected if the location suffers damage, such as a fire or an 
explosion. She also suffers the same penalties for ejection and lack 
of awareness of her surroundings as she would leaving a Fetter. 
However, the difficulty of the Perception + Awareness roll to 
notice her increases to 8, and she may make a Wits + Alertness 
roll (difficulty 7) to avoid being stunned when she emerges. 

A  wraith  who  managed  to  resolve  all  of  her  Fetters  may 
Slumber anywhere, as above, but the difficulty of the Perception 
+ Awareness roll to notice her presence increases to 10, and she is 
not stunned when she reemerges. What’s more, she remains dimly 
aware of her surroundings while she Slumbers. While she cannot 
make out conversations, read text, or pick up other fine details, she 
can perceive rough impressions of activity in the area and recognize 
familiar individuals or voices in the vicinity. She may choose to 
end her Slumber voluntarily in response to such stimuli. Doing 
so does mean that any Slumber advantages, such as regenerating 
lost Corpus, are considered interrupted and provide no benefits. 
Assuming that she isn’t jarred loose by damage, a wraith 
can choose to remain in Slumber for extended periods of time, 
and there are reliable reports of ancient wraiths Slumbering 
for decades or even centuries when it suits them. Most wraiths 
are afraid to go dormant for so long, however, as it means they 
cannot protect their Fetters or tend to their Passions, and thus 
may reawaken to find both much diminished.

Slumbering wraiths also dream, though the dreams of the dead 
are shot through with the bright hues of Passion contrasted against 
the dark intentions of the Shadow. As scenes from life mingle with 
experiences after death, a wraith may find herself dreaming of her 
living days but viewing them through Deathsight, for example, or 
seeing the Underworld as though it were part of the Skinlands.

Some wraiths claim to have experienced dreams related to 
important events and powerful figures by Slumbering in locations 
of great significance to them. The most famous are the wraiths 
who Slumber near the Onyx Tower in hopes of receiving dreams 
of Charon, though other “pilgrimage” sites exist throughout the 
Shadowlands and the Underworld.

hile Wraith is about telling a shared story 
through  roleplaying,  some  structure  is 
required so that the more dramatic aspects 
of the game flow smoothly. The rules in 
Chapter  Three  provide  the  framework 
for what to do when a roll is required, but 
it’s helpful to have references for specific 
situations that occur frequently. This chapter fleshes out the 
standard dramatic systems common to most chronicles, from 
handling the overall passage of time to managing individual 
combat maneuvers.

As always, the rules are merely guidelines. Remember 
the Golden Rule: If the Storyteller feels that modifying or 
outright ignoring the rules will benefit the story, that’s fine. 
Just remember to explain any changes to the players before 
the start of play, so that everyone’s on the same page.

Time

Much like in movies, time in a Wraith game compresses 
the boring stuff, and expands to focus on what’s most relevant 
and interesting to the story. Uneventful weeks may pass in 
a moment of real time, while dramatic events — whether 
seducing an influential Renegade, confronting a corrupt Le-
gionnaire, struggling to escape a Nihil, or fending off a pack of 
ravening Spectres — may unfold over most of a game session.

ROLEPLAYING AND “ROLL PLAYING”

roleplaying, the better. Immersing the players in 
story is central to a successful Wraith chronicle. 
Whenever  dice  start  flying,  it  weakens  the 
mood. If there’s no compelling reason why a 
character wouldn’t accomplish something she’s 
trying  to  do,  it’s  often  best  if  the  Storyteller 
simply grants the success and keeps the story 
flowing.

Even when the dice do come out, stick to 
rolls that are truly necessary. Requiring a roll 
each time a character performs even the sim-
plest feat (“Roll Dexterity + Athletics against 
difficulty  2  to  open  the  door”)  shatters  any 
attempt  at  creating  a  compelling  mood.  Just 
like the rest of the game, each die roll should 
provide opportunities for strategy and surprises.

To help maintain a general sense of the passage of time 
without resorting to charts, Wraith uses six basic units to 
describe game time:

Chapter 9:  Drama•  Turn: The amount of time your character needs to take 
a simple action. There is no formal duration to a turn. It 
may last anywhere from a few seconds to roughly a minute, 
depending on the pace of a given scene. Think of it as one 
panel of a comic book —in some cases, it may be a small 
panel  with  some  brief  dialogue,  in  others  a  large  splash 
page featuring dramatic action. 

•  Scene: Much like in movies, a scene is a compact period 
of action and interaction that takes place in a single loca-
tion. This could be a raid on a Spectre nest or a whispered 
conference in a Skinlands haunt. As with a turn, there is 
no set length: A scene is as long as it needs to be. Combat 
might be over in a brief burst of action, while a suspenseful 
encounter might last for some time. Similarly, a scene has 
as many turns as needed. Alternately, it might not have 
any  if  it  consists  of  nothing  but  dialogue  and  character 
interaction —actions that don’t require rolls. Remember, 
in Wraith, the focus is on story and telling a shared nar-
rative. You’re not on a countdown clock.

•  Chapter: A portion of a story, almost always played out in 
one game session. It consists of a series of scenes intercon-
nected by downtime, not unlike a single television episode 
or a chapter in a novel.

•  Story: A full tale, complete with introduction, rising ac-
tion, and climax. Some stories may take several chapters to 
complete. Others may be finished in one, or even transpire 
in a scene or two.

•  Chronicle: A series of stories connected by the characters 
themselves and their ongoing narrative, or possibly even 
by a common theme or overarching plot. 

•  Downtime: A passage of time in which players take no 
real action. Downtime is “glossed over”with description 
rather than played out turn by turn or scene by scene. The 
Storyteller is using downtime if he says, “You wait for almost 
two hours before the clerk escorts you to the Deathlord’s 
chamber.”The Storyteller should use downtime to move 
past trivial or tedious matters, or to allow characters to deal 
with simple, unchallenged activities. That said, a situation 
that begins as downtime might become a turn, scene, or 
even story if the players decide to undertake something 
more dramatic than the Storyteller originally expects…
or if the Storyteller has some surprises of her own in store. 

Balancing the flow of turns, scenes, and downtimes helps 
the story’s pacing immensely. For more information on pacing, 
see Chapter Seven (p. 253).

Action Scenes

Complicated actions load many scenes, and require cor-
responding dice rolls to make them happen. Action scenes can 
involve fighting a barghest, swinging across a chasm, running 
down a wounded heretic, or hammering a door closed before 
an approaching Maelstrom hits. While fights, chases, and other 

perilous moments are among players’favorite scenes, they can 
be among the most complicated for Storytellers to manage well.
Action scenes can vary wildly and develop in unexpected 
ways. You can do a few things to help them unfold smoothly 
regardless of the specific events that occur. 

First, it’s vital to describe the setting vividly. This establishes 
the tone of the scene, makes it clear what the environment is like, 
points out any antagonists and bystanders, and lets the players 
know their options when planning their characters’actions. Fail-
ing to set the stage clearly can bog down the game and frustrate 
everyone (“You never said the door between us and those Neph-
wracks was open!”). That said, don’t bother with information 
that doesn’t create story opportunities or give players ideas for 
interesting things their characters can do. Going into excruciating 
detail on what brand of shoes everyone is wearing accomplishes 
nothing except throwing off the scene’s momentum. 

Next, employ a series of turns within an action scene (see 
“Organizing Action,”below). It’s the one circumstance within 
the otherwise fluid time constraints of Wraith when having a 
formal structure is important. Turns in an action scene establish 
a consistent flow to events so that everyone knows what’s hap-
pening and has a chance to react accordingly. Without action 
turns, a player may be understandably upset that her character 
didn’t get the chance to stab a Doppelganger before getting 
punched the face.  

Last, it’s best to let players have their characters try just 
about anything, no matter how ridiculous or bizarre it might 
seem (though you may suggest a modification or an alternative 
approach to increase their odds of success). Be clear on how 
hard it might be to succeed at what they propose, of course, 
but there’s no harm if they still want to give it a shot. Even 
with  difficulty  10  and  multiple  successes  needed,  you  never 
know — they just might pull it off….
Organizing Action

Just  as  the  action  scene  is  divided  into  turns,  it’s  often 
helpful to break down the individual turns as well. Otherwise 
things can devolve into confusion with everyone calling out 
their actions at the same time and squabbling over who did 
what to whom first. 

In action scenes, turns have three stages: initiative, action 
(or  combat),  and  resolution.  Each  is  covered  below  with  the 
focus on how best to organize the narrative flow and establish 
character  options  within  the  scene  (for  detailed  systems  see 
“Combat Turns,” p. 326).

As with all other rules, this approach is optional. Still, it’s 
recommended to apply some form of structure in action scenes 
to sustain the story flow.
Roleplaying Action

While turns impose order on the chaos, it’s important to 
maintain the narrative. Think of it as a mix of game and story: 
You describe what you want your character to do, and roll to see 

314

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

whether it’s successful. The Storyteller then describes the result, 
while making sure everyone is up to speed on what’s happening.
Everything works together to create a dynamic narrative. 
It’s  dramatic  to  declare  “I  lunge  from  the  shadows,  bringing 
my cavalry saber down in a vicious slash!”then roll a successful 
hit which the Storyteller describes as “Your blade cleaves into 
his shoulder! The Spectre screams in pain and clutches at his 
sundered Corpus!” It’s dull to say simply “I attack,” followed 
by “Uh, he takes 4 levels of lethal damage.”
Initiative

This establishes the narrative landscape for the turn and 

the order of when characters will perform actions. 

The Storyteller should start the scene with a compelling 
description: the overall environment, any exits and relevant 
props  (e.g.,  furniture,  weapons),  and  the  location  of  allies, 
enemies, and bystanders. This is a critical first step, since it 
sets the stage for all action that follows and establishes what 
options the characters have available. Springing unfair surprises 
on the characters or not sharing all available information about 
a scene (“Oh, right; it turns out there was a relic blunderbuss 
on the wall”) is a sure way to achieve disorder. 

Be as descriptive as possible when setting the scene. Doing 
so not only provides options for what characters might do, it can 
also spark the players’imagination and add tremendous depth 
to the storytelling aspect of the game. Merely saying, “You’re 
in a room with a guy standing behind a desk”does nothing to 
maintain the flavor of the story. Instead, the Storyteller might 
describe the scene as “…a large study dominated by the relic 
of a mahogany desk, resting upon what looks to be a Moliated 
rug  in  a  Persian  pattern.  A  predatory-looking  wraith  stands 
behind the desk. On the wall behind him are numerous archaic 
weapons, obviously Artifacts, while on the desk itself, a soul-
forged ashtray emits a high-pitched moan.”This not only gives 
a better sense of the environment, it also injects menace into 
the scene and gives the characters some idea as to what — and 
with whom — they’re dealing.

In subsequent turns, the Storyteller should update the scene 

briefly from each character’s perspective. 

Once the scene is set, everyone determines initiative. The 
default method involves rolling 1 die and adding it to their 
character’s initiative rating (Dexterity + Wits). Regardless of 
the specific initiative system used, it’s best if the Storyteller 
establishes some sort of order to the action about to take place.
Starting at the bottom of the initiative order, players and 
Storyteller alike announce their respective characters’planned 
actions. This gives a leg up to those with higher initiatives, 
since they’re effectively thinking and reacting more quickly. 
By declaring their actions last, they can choose to build upon 
—or disrupt —whatever the slower characters are about to do.
Action/Combat

In this stage, characters take turns performing their declared 
actions, starting from the top of the initiative order. This is 

often a combat situation, though a scene may involve some 
other action —scaling a cliff rising from the Tempest, fleeing 
from a brace of hunting barghests, navigating the Tempest, etc. 
The dramatic and combat systems in the following sec-
tions  cover  many  actions  that  may  arise  in  a  game,  but  the 
Storyteller is the final arbiter of how each action is handled. 
She determineswhatever rolls are needed, along with associated 
difficulties and number of successes needed. These rolls can be 
as simple or as complicated as the Storyteller feels is necessary 
to resolve the action. 
Resolution

As the term suggests, the resolution stage is where everyone 
works out the results of their actions. Any damage inflicted is 
applied at this time, and the Storyteller describes what happens 
in the scene as a consequence of actions taken during the turn. 
Effectively, the Storyteller translates all the dice rolls and 
actions into description, story, and plot. While players declare 
actions and roll dice, it’s the characters who engage in the con-
flict. Focusing on dice rolling ignores the central roleplaying 
element of the game. For instance, the Storyteller shouldn’t 
merely confirm whether a maneuver was successful or simply 
state the amount of damage inflicted. She should describe how 
a daring escape unfolds or the devastating impact of an attack. 
The  more  evocative  the  description  of  what  the  characters 
do, the better.

By  the  end  of  the  turn,  everyone  should  update  their 
characters’current  status  and  physical  condition  as  relevant. 
The Storyteller then declares the turn ended, and starts the 
next one as described above. Simply repeat this until the scene 
reaches its conclusion. 

Dramatic Systems

uring a game session, characters will attempt 
any  number  of  diverse  and  complicated 
actions.  The  Storyteller  keeps  these 
activities organized while determining their 
success or failure and resulting impact on 
the story.

The  dramatic  systems  in  this  section 
make the Storyteller’s job easier by supplying clear rules for a 
number of common activities. As noted elsewhere, the Sto-
ryteller may choose to roleplay everything out if she feels it’s 
appropriate. This is not uncommon with Mental and Social 
dramatic  systems,  but  Physical  feats  generally  require  some 
form of arbitration.

If these systems are used, be consistent in how they’re ap-
plied. This avoids misunderstandings among players and keeps 
the game humming along smoothly.

Performing  a  feat  typically  involves  adding  a  particular 
Attribute and Ability, which are noted next to the feat title. 
If a feat falls within a character’s specialty (p. 125), that char-

DRAMA

acter may roll again, adding any further successes to their total.
Feat rolls are made versus difficulty 6, unless specifically noted 
otherwise in the description. 

Many of these systems involve taking one or more actions 
over the course of one or more turns. In many cases, a charac-
ter may try an action again if the first attempt is unsuccessful, 
though at the Storyteller’s discretion, a difficulty penalty may 
apply (see “Trying It Again,” p. 100).

Automatic Feats

Automatic feats require the character to take an action, 
but seldom involve a dice pool roll. The Storyteller may, at her 
discretion, declare additional feats as automatic in addition to 
the common ones listed below.

• Activate Arcanoi: A wraith character may spend Pathos 
to activate an Arcanos power. Activation occurs automatically 
and does not require concentration unless noted otherwise. 

•  Heal:  A  wraith  character  may  spend  Pathos  to  heal 
bashing or lethal damage (p. 295). Your character must con-
centrate and do nothing else for one full turn. Trying to heal 
while performing other actions requires success on a Stamina 
reflexive roll (difficulty 8). Failing this roll means the wraith 
loses all expended Pathos points with no effect, while a botch 
causes the wraith to lose both 1 additional Pathos point and 
suffer 1 additional level of bashing damage. 

If a character is struck while healing, first resolve the dam-
age the character was in the process of healing at the time, then 
apply any damage from the new attack.

• Movement: Your character may walk, jog, or run without 
making a roll. A walking character moves at seven yards/meters 
per turn. A jogging character moves at (12 + Dexterity) yards/
meters per turn. Running all out covers (20 + [3 x Dexterity]) 
yards/meters per turn.

Your character may move at up to half maximum running 
speed, then attack or perform another action. Your character 
may also move while taking another action. Doing so reduces 
1 die from that action’s dice pool for each yard/meter moved.
The Storyteller may call for a Dexterity + Athletics roll 
(difficulty 6) for your character to maintain footing and direction 
in hazardous conditions (slick surface, harsh weather, enemy 
fire). If your character tries to flee an encounter, he must actively 
dodge until he clears the immediate area.

If your character floats in the Tempest without benefit of 
an appropriate Arcanos (Argos, Tempestos, Tempest Weaving), 
he moves at one-half normal walking rate (rounded down), and 
can only change direction by spending a Pathos point.

Note that injured characters cannot move at maximum 

• Power a Relic: Certain relics — notably computers and 
other electronic devices, ranged weapons, and vehicles — require 
Pathos to function. Initial activation requires physical contact 
and occurs automatically with the appropriate Pathos expendi-
ture.  Neither  sustained  contact  nor  concentration  is  required 

speed.

316

afterward unless stated otherwise. After activation, anyone may 
use the relic and it remains powered for the rest of the scene.

More than one character may spend Pathos to power the 

same relic. 

The  Relic  Vehicle  (p.  319)  and  Ranged  Weapons  
(pp. 338–339) tables list Pathos costs required to activate 
various relics.

Your character may apply Usury powers to activate relics 

instead; simply use those systems as relevant (see p. 217).

• Ready/Reload a Weapon: This covers drawing a weapon 
or reloading with a prepared magazine. No roll is required so 
long as your character takes no other action that turn. Readying 
a weapon is a full action, doing so while attempting something 
else  in  the  same  turn  requires  taking  a  multiple  action  (see 
“Multiple Actions” p. 100) and making a successful Dexter-
ity + Athletics, Melee, or Firearms roll as appropriate to the 
weapon (difficulty 4).

• Stand Up: Your character may get to his feet in one turn 
without making a roll. Standing up while doing something else 
in the same turn requires taking a multiple action (see “Multiple 
Actions,” p. 100) and making a successful Dexterity + Athletics 
roll (difficulty 4).

• Start a Vehicle: Starting a vehicle takes an action, but 
normally requires no roll. If your character wants to start an 
unusual vehicle (e.g., motorcycle, semi, tank), the Storyteller 
may call for a reflexive Wits + Drive roll (difficulty 4). 

Your  character  may  apply  appropriate  Inhabit  powers 

instead; simply use those systems as relevant (p. 173).

• Yield: Your character may reserve his action and let initia-
tive pass to the next character. When yielding, your character 
may  then  choose  to  take  his  action  at  any  point  before  the 
end of the turn. If everyone yields their actions, no one does 
anything that turn.
Physical Feats

These systems cover actions involving the three Physical 
Attributes (Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina). As noted above, 
assume difficulty 6 for any maneuver unless a description states 
otherwise.

Remember that certain Moliate powers add dice to Physi-

cal Attributes when making many of these rolls.

• Carrying Capacity (Strength): Your character can carry 
25  lbs/10  kg  per  point  of  Strength  without  penalty.  Should 
your character exceed this total, the added weight incurs an 
automatic +1 difficulty to every action involving physical skills. 
Also, every 25 lbs/10 kg over the limit halves your character’s 
base movement, rounding down. Your character cannot move 
if she’s bearing a total weight of double her Strength allocation. 
This system is a guideline to reflect being heavily laden. The 
Storyteller shouldn’t call for an inventory check each time your 
character picks up something small. If only lifting or otherwise 
shifting weight, refer to the Lift/Break system (p. 320).

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

• Climb [Dexterity + Athletics]: This feat covers every-
thing from clambering up a rocky slope to scaling the side of a 
building. Climbing is typically an extended action, lasting until 
you’ve accumulated enough successes to reach the desired height. 
Each success rolled indicates that your character has climbed 
two yards/meters. Botching a climb attempt can have drastic 
consequences,from slipping or getting stuck to falling outright.
The difficulty categories below provide a quick reference. 
The Storyteller may adjust the difficulty further depending on 
additional factors such as the degree of incline, weather condi-
tions, and whether your character is under duress (panicked, 
being shot at, etc.). For instance, rain or gusting wind might 
apply  a  +1  to  +3  difficulty.  Conversely,  using  climbing  gear 
grants a –2 difficulty to climbing. Additional factors can never 
adjust the difficulty lower than 2 or higher than 10.

Using Moliate to assist with climbing (creating claws or 

similar “climbing gear”) grants a –2 difficulty.

• Drive/Pilot [Dexterity/Wits + Drive]: No roll is required 
to steer even a relic vehicle under normal circumstances, as 
long  as  your  character  has  at  least  Drive  1  and  uses  Pathos 
to power the vehicle for the scene (see “Automatic Feats,” p. 
316). However, a number of factors —road conditions, speed, 
complex maneuvers —can challenge even the most competent 
driver, as noted below. The factors are cumulative,so driving 
recklessly in bad weather while trying to lose a tail adds up to 
+3 difficulty. The Storyteller may modify the difficulty further, 
as appropriate to the circumstance.

Difficulty  Driving Factor

+1 
+1 
+1 
+1 

Bad road conditions (cracks, potholes, gravel)
Bad weather (hard rain, strong winds)
Heavy traffic/obstacles (rush hour, pedestrians)
Reckless driving (ignoring your surroundings)

If you activate Claim the Shell (Inhabit, p. 174) to control 
a vehicle, you may use your Inhabit rating instead of Drive for 
any maneuver rolls.

Since no two vehicles handle the same way (a sports car 
is designed for speed, while a minivan is built for safety), see 
the Relic Vehicle table for details on safe speed, maximum 
speed,  and  maneuverability.  For  every  10  mph/15  km/h  a 
vehicle travels over its safe driving speed, apply +1 difficulty 
to any maneuver. Additionally, the vehicle’s maneuver rat-
ing dictates the maximum number of dice the driver can roll, 

ARTIFACT AIRCRAFTS

These  unique  aircrafts  endure  in  the  Un-
derworld  due  to  the  indelible  mark  left  upon 
the realms of both the Quick and the dead. The 
Storyteller is encouraged to come up with other 
crafts — as well as cars, ships, and other vehicles 
— as benefits the chronicle.

that, four centuries before the Wright broth-
ers, Leonardo da Vinci designed a heavier-

regardless of whether the driver’s total Dexterity + Drive dice 
pool exceeds that amount. 

Your character can perform a special maneuver to evade 
or catch up with another vehicle, such as make a sudden turn, 
do a 180, or block off a Byway. When your character makes 
a special maneuver, any other drivers who want to stick with 
her  must  succeed  at  a  similar  maneuver.  For  details  on  how 
successes from special maneuvers are applied during a chase, 
see “Pursuit” (p. 320).

When driving or piloting a vehicle, solid objects present 
less of a hazard to wraiths than they do to the living. A wraith 
can drive a relic sports car right through an oncoming Skinlands 
18-wheeler with minimal Corpus damage to her vehicle, herself, 
and anyone riding with her. Each wraith in a relic vehicle that 
passes through a solid object takes 1 level of bashing damage 
and goes Incorporeal for one turn (see “Corpus States,” p. 291). 
If the relic vehicle is still within a solid Skinlands object when 
the wraiths’ Corporeal states resume, each takes an additional 
1 level of bashing damage and repeats the process. 

A relic vehicle that passes through a solid object suffers the 
same fate —however, since inanimate objects do not heal, any 
damage suffered is permanent unless repaired. Bear in mind that 
characters can spend Pathos to repair a relic vehicle.

Relic vehicles affect each other normally, even if both are 

Incorporeal at the time.

•  Hotwire  [Dexterity  +  Streetwise]:  To  hotwire,  roll 
versus  difficulty  8.  If  successful,  the  vehicle  starts  and  runs 

normally. Failure means it simply doesn’t start on that attempt. 
On a botch, your character has ripped out the necessary wires, 
created a short, or otherwise wrecked the wiring so that she 
cannot start the vehicle at all. 

On many vehicles, the wires are secured under a steering 
wheel cover or other panel. In that case, your character must 
first  expose  the  wires  by  forcing  the  panel  with  a  successful 
Strength  +  Repair  roll  (difficulty  6).  On  a  botch,  the  cover 
breaks and cannot be put back in place.

If you use Inhabit to possess a vehicle, apply that system 

instead of making a hotwire attempt.

• Intrusion [Dexterity/Perception + Larceny]: Intrusion 
covers breaking and entering, evading simple security devices, 
picking  locks,  cracking  safes  —and  preventing  others  from 
doing the same. Wraiths can bypass most Skinlands security 
for obvious reasons, but there may be times when interacting 
with physical security is required. Regardless, locks, safes, and 
other defensive measures are common in relics and soulforged 
objects throughout the Underworld.

The Storyteller determines the difficulty based on the security 
system’s complexity; after all, beating a standard lock (difficulty 5) 
is far less challenging than breaking into Fort Knox (difficulty 9). 
Most intrusion tasks require lockpicks, jamming devices, or other 
relevant tools. Also, certain tasks might require your character 
to have a minimum level of Larceny to succeed (e.g., Larceny 1 
is sufficient to pick a simple lock, but not to crack a safe).

You may try multiple times to open manual locks. When 
bypassing active security, your roll must succeed on the first at-
tempt. Failure triggers any active alarms. On a botch in either 
circumstance, your character’s clumsy break-in attempt goes 
horribly awry.

Setting up security measures is a standard action. Any extra 
successes increase the system’s quality, effectively adding to the 
difficulty required to breach it.

Note  that  Larceny  is  specific  to  the  physical  aspects  of 
intrusion.  Dealing  with  the  technology  that  comprises  the 
security  system  itself  requires  dots  in  Technology.  So,  your 
character would use intrusion to get into or out of somewhere, 
but could not rewire an alarm system or confound a surveil-
lance camera feed.

Certain Inhabit arts can control or disable security devices 

from the mechanical to the electronic (see p. 174). 

• Jump [Strength (standing); Strength + Athletics (run-
ning)]:  To  jump  successfully,  your  character  must  clear  the 
distance between her and her destination. Roll versus difficulty 
3, with the number of successes rolled determining distance 
traveled (see below). On a failure, your character doesn’t make 
it, but you may roll Dexterity + Athletics (difficulty 6) to see 
if your character grabs a ledge or other safety as she falls. On 
a botch, your character may slip before the leap, slam into a 
wall, or fall to her doom.

By making a successful Perception + Athletics roll (dif-
ficulty 8) before the jump, you may gauge exactly how many 
successes are needed to make the leap.

•  Lift/Break  [Strength]:  Your  character’s  Strength  is 
often  used  alone,  without  an  Ability,  for  actions  requiring 
brute force. The Feats of Strength table shows the minimum 
Strength needed to perform a desired feat without a dice roll. 
At the Storyteller’s discretion, you may increase your character’s 
effective Strength by 1 if she simply wants to drag something a 
short distance instead of pick it up.

Your character may roll to affect greater weight than her 
Strength rating allows. However, this is a Willpower roll (dif-
ficulty 9) and may be tried only once on a particular object. 
Each success advances your character up 1 level on the chart. 
Lifting is all or nothing —if you fail the roll, nothing happens. 
On a botch, your character may tear her Corpus or drop the 
object on herself or someone else.

Characters  can  use  teamwork  (p.  101)  to  lift  an  object 
together. Each player rolls separately, and resulting successes 
are combined. 

A damaged tool, weapon, or vehicle may suffer negative modi-
fiers to its use, at the Storyteller’s discretion. To actually destroy 
an object requires inflicting damage equal to its Corpus (p. 329).
Note:  A  relic’s  durability  is  generally  equivalent  to  its 
Skinlands  counterpart  (see  “Object  Corpus,”  p.  329).  Soul-
forged and Stygian steel items are notably stronger: Bending or 
breaking a soulforged object requires a Strength rating 1 level 
higher than normal, and against Stygian steel requires a rating 
2 levels higher than normal.

• Open/Close [Strength]: Forcing a door open or closed 
calls for a Strength roll (difficulty 6 for thin wood or metal, dif-
ficulty 8 for more substantial materials). The bigger and thicker 
the door, the greater number of successes needed to force it open 
or slam it shut, as listed below. This may be an extended action, 
and may involve teamwork (p. 101). Additionally, opposing 
forces on the other side of the door result in a resisted action.
Heavier doors may require a Strength minimum to even 

make an attempt, at the Storyteller’s discretion.

To actually destroy a door requires inflicting damage equal 

to its Corpus (p. 329).

may be times when the parties have similar speeds, or when 
the quarry may get to safety before the pursuer can catch up. 
In such cases, use the system below.

Basic pursuit is an extended action. The target starts with 
a number of free extra successes based on her distance from the 
pursuer:  on  foot,  1  success  for  every  two  yards/meters  ahead 
of pursuers; in a vehicle, 1 success for every 10 yards/meters 
ahead of pursuers. 

For  chases  involving  wraiths  and  mortals,  remember 
that mortals tire, but the dead do not. Also, wraiths can pass 
through physical barriers (p. 292), while mortals must navigate 
around them.

Each turn, quarry and pursuer make the appropriate roll 
(depending on the type of pursuit), adding new successes to 
any gained in previous turns. If the pursuer accumulates more 
total successes than the target has, he catches up and may take 
further actions to stop the chase. As the quarry accumulates 
successes, she gains distance from her pursuer and may try to 
lose any opponents. Each success that the quarry accumulates 
beyond the pursuer’s total acts as a +1 difficulty to any Percep-
tion roll the pursuer must make to remain on the target’s tail. 
The Storyteller may call for the pursuer to make a Perception 
roll  at  any  time  (up  to  once  each  turn).  If  the  pursuer  fails 
this roll, his quarry is considered to have slipped away —lost 
in a crowd, escaped down a side street, etc. On a botch, the 
pursuer loses his quarry immediately. If the quarry botches at 
any point, she’s delayed in some way (runs into a Legionnaire 
patrol, stumbles across a Nihil, etc.).

• Pursuit [Dexterity + Athletics/Drive]: Pursuit is often 
resolved automatically with the method for calculating move-
ment. If one party is clearly faster than another, the faster one 
catches or evades the opposition eventually. However, there 

320

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

For vehicle pursuit, combine this with the system for driving/pilot-
ing (p. 317). Simply use the maneuver rolls established in that system to 
determine success, then apply any extra successes from each participant’s 
maneuver roll to resolve any relative gain or loss.

• Sneak [Dexterity + Stealth]: To sneak, your character uses Dex-
terity + Stealth in a resisted action against Perception + Alertness rolls 
from anyone able to detect her passing. Factors such as being noisy, having 
unsecured gear or lack of cover, or passing large groups of observers can 
modify  the  standard  difficulty.  Additionally,  security  devices,  scanners, 
or superior vantage points may add dice to Perception + Alertness rolls. 
Unless an observer scores more successes than the sneaking character does, 
she passes undetected. On a botch, the sneaking character stumbles into 
one of the people she’s avoiding, walks into the open, or performs some 
other compromising action.

Note  that  some  Argos  and  Pandemonium  powers  may  enhance  a 

wraith’s ability to pass unnoticed. 

•Swim [Stamina + Athletics]: Swimming over a long distance or 
for a long duration requires a successful standard swim roll, though severe 
weather conditions may increase the difficulty. The first roll is made after one 
hour of sustained activity, and an additional roll is made every subsequent 
hour the activity continues. A single success is all that’s needed to keep 
swimming. On a failed roll, the character loses headway or goes slightly 
off course. On a botch, she loses her orientation entirely or starts to sink.

Being able to swim requires a minimum of Athletics 1.
• Throw [Dexterity + Athletics]: Your character can throw an object 
that is not designed to be thrown (ashtray, beer bottle, book, rock, shoe) 
and weighs two pounds/one kilogram or less a maximum of Strength x 
five yards/meters. For every additional two pounds/one kilogram an object 
weighs, this distance decreases by five yards/meters (it’s not easy to throw 
heavy things). If an object’s weight reduces the throwing distance to zero, 
the most your character can do is shove it to one side —roughly one yard/
meter of distance. If an object’s weight is too great to be lifted, it can’t be 
thrown (refer instead to “Lift/Break,”p. 320).

For an object that is balanced for throwing (grenade, javelin, throwing 
knife), your character can throw it up to Strength + Athletics x five yards/
meters. The object is still limited to the maximum range for which it was 
designed (see “Thrown Weapons & Explosives,” p. 336).

The Storyteller may reduce throwing distances for particularly un-
wieldy objects, or increase them for aerodynamic ones. Throwing an object 
accurately requires a successful Dexterity + Athletics roll (difficulty 6 up 
to half of the maximum range, difficulty 8 from half of the maximum to 
the maximum range). Wind conditions may adjust the difficulty further. 
On a botch, your character might drop the object or strike a companion 
with it accidentally.

If throwing an opponent, use the throw combat maneuver instead 

(p. 334).

•  Tail  [Dexterity  +  Stealth/Drive]:  To  tail  someone  successfully, 
your character keeps direct tabs on the target without necessarily catching 
him —and without being noticed herself. Tailing can be done on foot or 
in a vehicle. Someone else can drive the vehicle, as long as your character 
is the one navigating. 

At  the  Storyteller’s  discretion,  or  if  the  target  suspects  he’s  being 
pursued, the target’s player can roll Perception + Alertness whenever he 

DRAMA

321

has a chance to spot his tail (the Storyteller decides when such 
an opportunity arises). The tailing player opposes this with a 
Dexterity + Stealth roll (or Dexterity + Drive, if the tail is in 
a vehicle). Environmental conditions may modify the standard 
difficulty (heavy crowds, empty streets, bad weather, Skinlands 
interference, etc.). Use of certain Arcanoi may influence these 
rolls further.

As long as the tail gets more successes, she remains un-
noticed (at least, until the Storyteller calls for another opposed 
roll). If the quarry scores the same number of successes as his 
pursuer, his suspicion of being followed grows, granting him a 
-1 difficulty to his next roll (to a minimum of 2). If the quarry 
scores  at  least  one  more  success  than  his  tail  does,  he  spots 
her and may act accordingly —whether now trying to escape 
pursuit, turning to confront the tail, or continuing to lead her 
on seemingly unaware that he’s being followed. 

Two or more characters can trade off tailing responsibilities. 
As long as they’ve trained together, this is a standard teamwork 
effort (p. 101). Otherwise, a +1 difficulty applies to everyone 
doing the tailing. 
Mental Feats

These systems cover tasks involving the three Mental At-
tributes (Perception, Intelligence, Wits), as well as tasks that 
use Pathos, Arcanoi, and Willpower. Mental tests can reveal 
information that your character knows even if you, the player, 
don’t. Still, as always, you should rely on your own roleplaying 
and creativity when solving problems, not on dice rolls.

As noted above, assume difficulty 6 for any feat attempts 
unless  a  description  states  otherwise.  Bear  in  mind  that  all 
Mental feats are subject to +2 difficulty when performed in the 
Tempest (see “Maneuver Conditions,” p. 329). 

• Creativity [variable]: Some wraiths were artists in life, 
while others may have discovered the spark of creativity only 
after death. The roll for creative expression depends on what 
your character wants to create: a portrait of Charon, a land-
scape of the Philadelphia Necropolis, a poem about the living 
world,  stories  featuring  a  hard-bitten  ghost  private  eye  —or 
even something that isn’t focused on death, for a change. A 
common roll is Perception (to come up with a subject worthy 
of expressing) + Expression or Crafts (to capture the feeling in 
an artistic medium). Difficulty depends on the nature of the 
creation —it’s easier to write a limerick than a Petrarchan sonnet. 
The number of successes governs the quality of the finished 
creation: 1 success indicates a decent work, while 5 successes 
is a literary or artistic masterpiece. Some creative efforts might 
require extended success rolls (e.g., novels, large sculptures, vast 
murals). On a botch, your character unwittingly embarrasses a 
patron, leaves out key details, goes on a tangent that neglects 
her original intent, or creates the greatest work ever known in 
the worlds of the living or the dead!…while everyone else sees it 
for the crap it truly is.

At the Storyteller’s discretion, a wraith who creates a par-
ticularly inspired masterwork might be eligible for advancement 
closer to Transcendence.

•  Computer  Use  [Intelligence/Wits  +  Computer]: 
Although ubiquitous across much of the living world, many 
wraiths still dismiss computers as little more than a curiosity. 
Such views ignore the power that computers have to collect 
information,  share  knowledge  and  opinions,  and  coordinate 
like-minded individuals across vast distances. 

For  the  purposes  of  this  feat,  a  “computer”covers  most 
anything from a traditional desktop machine to the latest smart-
phone, or even an old mainframe system. Most Computer Skill 
rolls are made to collect, display, or transfer information. Use 
Technology for physical results instead, like turning off a security 
system remotely or activating a restricted elevator. Similarly, 
use Technology to access or modify Skinlands devices that use 
software and computer systems (cars, security systems, checkout 
scanners, game consoles). That said, a player who makes a good 
argument for using Computer in a particular circumstance may 
try a roll, at the Storyteller’s discretion.

Computer use typically falls within two distinct types of 

behavior:

Personal Use: Performing research, writing software, or 
participating in social networks. For example, using a search 
engine to research a topic might invoke an Intelligence + Com-
puters roll. Such feats are straightforward unless performed in 
unusual circumstances (your character has but seconds before 
barghests come crashing through the door) or using unfamiliar 
devices (“what the hell’s a ‘Personal Data Assistant’?”). 

Computers are pervasive in the modern world, so it’s seldom 
necessary to require a roll unless there are dramatic repercussions 
for failure. Also, there may be times when Computer isn’t the 
relevant Ability for the task at hand. For instance, joining an 
online community of “monster hunters”is more appropriately 
a Wits + Subterfuge or Charisma + Expression roll.

If your character botches personal use, she may turn up 
misleading information, write buggy software that crashes the 
system, or accidentally broadcast embarrassing or compromis-
ing information.

Hacking:  In  game  terms,  hacking  involves  exploiting 
weaknesses in a computer system or network to obtain and/or 
manipulate information. When attempting a hack, roll Intelli-
gence or Wits + Computer. The difficulty depends on the system 
being hacked: difficulty 6 for personal networks to difficulty 9 
for corporate server clusters or old government mainframes. 

(In some situations, hacking can involve turning a device 
or  computer  program  against  or  beyond  its  original  intent 
—putting an alert on a screen that doesn’t normally display 
messages or fabricating official documents for a false identity. 
To keep things simple, resolve such situations in the same way 
as information-driven hacking.)

The successes rolled indicate the size of your dice pool for 
interacting with the system once it’s been breached. On a botch, 

322

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

the hacker may alert security to her presence or even reveal her 
identity to the system she’s trying to breach.

Blocking a hacker is a resisted action. If the hacker wins, 
she accesses the system unopposed for a number of turns equal 
to the extra successes rolled. If the defender wins, the hacker 
is kicked from the system and may not try again for the rest of 
the scene. On a tie, the opponents’ cat-and-mouse continues 
into the next turn. 

Hacking is almost always an extended action, and requiring 
a high number of successes is recommended. After all, hacking 
isn’t some magical “I can do anything I want because computers 
are magic”solution. It should take more than 1 or 2 successes to 
delete one’s own birth records or put in a work order to destroy 
a target’s Fetter. 

You may use Claim the Shell (Inhabit, p. 174) to assist 
further with computer use. Simply add extra successes from a 
successful Inhabit attempt to subsequent computer use-rolls on 
the targeted device.

• Investigate [Perception + Investigation]: Any search for 
clues, evidence, or hidden contraband. This covers everything 
from reviewing a crime scene for evidence to searching a room 
for a trap door. The Storyteller may increase the standard dif-
ficulty if clues are particularly obscure or well concealed —for 
instance, an envelope in a drawer might be difficulty 6, while 
one  hidden  inside  a  hollow  chair  leg  might  be  difficulty  9. 
The number of successes indicates the amount of information 
gleaned. At a crime scene, 1 success provides a basic idea of 
what happened, with additional successes offering deductions as 
to perpetrator and motive. If searching for a concealed door, 1 
or 2 successes may be enough to find it, but more successes may 
be required to figure out how to open it. On a botch, obvious 
clues are missed or even destroyed accidentally.

• Repair [Dexterity/Perception + Crafts]: There aren’t 
many repair shops in the Shadowlands, so wraiths must usually 
do the job themselves. Depending on the specialty involved, 
Crafts can be used to repair anything from pottery to automo-
bile engines (for computers, use Technology). Before repairing 
a device, your character must first make a standard research 
roll to identify what’s wrong with it. The Storyteller then sets 
the repair difficulty based on the problem’s severity, whether 
proper tools and replacement parts are on hand, and if adverse 
conditions exist. An inspired result on the initial research roll 
may offset these factors somewhat. 

Simple repairs take at least a few turns to complete, while 
more complex repairs are extended actions that last 10 minutes 
for each success needed (some repairs may be completed in more 
than one sitting, at the Storyteller’s discretion). On a botch, 
your character may simply waste time and a new part, or even 
make the problem worse.

A wraith may repair a relic or Artifact by spending Pathos 

instead.

• Research [Intelligence + Academics/Occult/Science]: 
Research covers everything from poring over obscure tomes to 
searching computer databases. Whatever the case, the number 
of successes achieved determines the amount of information 
discovered: 1 success provides at least basic information, with 
extra successes turning up further details. The Storyteller may 
assign  a  high  difficulty  for  particularly  obscure  data.  On  a 
botch, your character may not uncover anything at all or may 
misinterpret what she does find.

•  Track  [Perception  +  Investigation]:  Unlike  trailing, 
tracking requires following physical evidence (footprints, fluid 
trails, broken twigs, smudges on walls, threads caught on fenc-
ing, tire tracks) to find a target. It’s a standard action to track 
someone. Multiple successes provide extra information (number 
of  subjects,  rate  of  speed,  estimated  build).  The  quarry  can 
cover his trail with a successful Wits + Investigation roll, with 
each success applying a +1 difficulty to any tracking attempts 
(maximum difficulty 10). Abnormal weather, poor conditions 
(urban environment), and how much time has passed before 
tracking began also add to tracking difficulty. 

On a missed tracking roll, you can try again, but your char-
acter suffers an additional +1 difficulty to the attempt. Upon 
reaching  difficulty  10  (or  if  rolling  a  botch),  your  character 
loses the trail and must go back to the beginning to start over 
—though this time beginning at difficulty 8.

On a botch, your character not only loses the trail but also 

destroys any signs of the quarry’s passage.

This system focuses on tracking in the Skinlands. As wraiths 
seldom leave footprints, attempts to track the Restless or Spectres 
without benefit of an appropriate Arcano starts at difficulty 8.
Social Feats

These systems cover tasks involving the three Social At-
tributes  (Charisma,  Manipulation,  Appearance).  As  always, 
these systems are merely guidelines. While there are times when 
a player’s abilities cannot match her character’s, the Storyteller 
may ignore Social systems when a player exhibits particularly 
good —or excruciatingly bad —roleplaying.

As noted above, assume difficulty 6 for any feat attempts 

unless a description states otherwise.

DRAMA

323

• Credibility [Manipulation/Perception + Persuasion]: 
Credibility applies when trust is in question. In game terms, it’s 
used most often when trying to perpetrate or uncover a scam 
(e.g., impersonating someone in authority, looking for forged 
documents). The perpetrator rolls Manipulation + Persuasion in 
a resisted action against the subject’s Perception + Subterfuge. 
Credentials or other documentation may add to the difficulty 
of anyone trying to detect deception; conversely, teamwork may 
be used to scrutinize a claim. The Storyteller may also call for 
hacking and/or intrusion rolls to support claims of credibility. 
If the perpetrator gets more successes, she is considered cred-
ible and is treated accordingly. On a tie, the subject recognizes 
the perpetrator’s credibility grudgingly, but may keep a close 
eye on her. If the subject gets more successes, the perpetrator’s 
effort fails but the subject is not necessarily alarmed; the per-
petrator may try to withdraw without drawing further attention 
to herself. If the perpetrator botches, she is caught in a lie and 
draws significant unwanted attention. If the subject botches, 
he believes wholeheartedly in the perpetrator’s claims despite 
any subsequent evidence to the contrary.

• Fast-Talk [Manipulation + Persuasion]: When there’s 
no time for subtlety, baffle them with nonsense. Fast-talking is 
a resisted action that pits your character’s Manipulation + Sub-
terfuge or Persuasion, depending on circumstance, against the 

target’s Wits + Subterfuge. If you get more successes, a series of 
almost-believable half-truths browbeats the subject into accom-
modating you. On a tie, you can continue babbling the next turn 
(or simply walk away before the target gets wise to your chica-
nery). If the target gets more successes, he grows wary, resulting 
in a +1 difficulty to any fast-talk attempt you make next turn. 
On a botch, your character’s rambling goes too far, angering the 
target and making him immune to any further fast-talk attempts. 
• Interrogate [Manipulation + Persuasion/Intimidation]: 
Anyone can ask questions. When interrogating, your character 
asks questions with leverage. Interrogating someone peacefully 
involves making strategic inquiries designed to reveal specific 
information. This is a resisted action between the interroga-
tor’s  Manipulation  +  Empathy  and  the  subject’s  Willpower. 
The Storyteller calls for rolls as appropriate during key points 
in questioning, up to once per turn.

Violent interrogation involves torturing the victim’s mind or 
body until she reveals what she knows. This is a resisted action 
between the interrogator’s Manipulation + Intimidation and 
the subject’s Stamina + 3 or Willpower (whichever is higher). 
Rolls occur each time the interrogator demands an answer, up 
to once per turn. Each time a resisted action occurs, the subject 
loses 1 point of Willpower if being tortured psychologically, or 
suffers 1 level of bashing damage if being tortured physically. 

324

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Multiple  interrogators  can  work  together,  combining 
successes. This works even if one interrogator uses Empathy 
while  another  uses  Intimidation  (the  classic  “good  cop/bad 
cop”approach). 

Further, in death, a whole new range of interrogation op-
tions becomes available. Judicious use of Arcanoi can be used 
to enhance mundane techniques — whether Pandemonium to 
keep the victim off balance, or Keening or Moliate for new and 
unusual methods of “enhanced interrogation.”

Whatever the method used, the interrogator gleans informa-
tion for each success that exceeds the subject’s resisted roll. Still, 
bear in mind that details may reflect what the subject thinks she 
wants her interrogator to hear. If the interrogator botches, the 
target goes mum and will never reveal anything —or perhaps 
even lies believably. Given this possibility, the Storyteller may 
choose to handle any rolls involved in interrogation.

related to what was asked for 

•  Intimidate  [Manipulation/Strength  +  Intimidation]: 
Your character can intimidate through subtle menace or out-
right threat. Subtle intimidation is based on a perceived threat 
(losing one’s rank within the Legions, being arrested, pain and 
agony later in afterlife), and involves rolling Manipulation + 
Intimidation in a resisted action against the subject’s Willpower.
Blatant intimidation is exactly that: direct threat of physi-
cal harm. This involves rolling Strength + Intimidation in a 
resisted action against the subject’s Willpower or Strength + 
Intimidation (whichever is higher).

Whatever the method, the target must get more successes or 
be cowed. On a tie, your character may try to intimidate again 
on the next turn. On a botch, your character looks ridiculous 
and doesn’t impress anyone present for the rest of the scene.

The Storyteller may also allow passive intimidation. This 
doesn’t involve a roll. Your character simply gives off a vibe 
that guarantees plenty of space wherever she goes, whether on 
a subway platform or in the local pub. The more dots your char-
acter has in Intimidation, the less likely others are to get close.
• Perform [Charisma + Expression/Leadership]: Perform 
has two main expressions: oration to influence, or performance 
to entertain.

Oration: Roll Charisma + Leadership when your character 
gives a speech or presentation in hopes of influencing an audi-
ence. While you need not recite the desired speech verbatim, 
you must at least express the central message. The Storyteller 
may also ask for opening lines or a memorable phrase —and who 

knows? This may even encourage you to embrace the moment 
and give an actual speech.

Performance:  Roll  Charisma  +  Expression  when  your 
character  strives  to  entertain  an  audience  (singing,  acting, 
reciting a monologue, doing improv, etc.). 

When appearing before an audience, your character gets 
only one chance to succeed: A single roll represents her entire 
oration or performance. The Storyteller may increase the stan-
dard difficulty depending on the audience’s mood (cynical, drunk, 
hostile, composed entirely of Spectres) and/or environmental 
factors (huge crowd, poor acoustics, inclement weather, other 
activities occurring nearby). 

The number of successes indicates how compelling your 
character’s effort was and how well she impressed the audience.

On a failed roll, your character doesn’t capture the audience’s 
attention and support (your speech rambled, you sang off-key). 
On a botch, your character damages her reputation, causes some 
mishap, or riles the crowd into outright antagonism toward her. 
If  your  character  has  time  to  rehearse  beforehand,  roll 
Intelligence  +  Expression  (difficulty  7).  Success  grants  a  -1 
difficulty to the subsequent oration or performance roll. Failure 
has no effect, though a botch increases the perform difficulty 
(your character misses a gaffe in the script or becomes sloppy 
from overconfidence). 

The Storyteller may allow this feat as an extended action, 
if the performance is vital to the story. However, a +1 difficulty 
applies each turn after the third as the audience grows restless.
For an oration or performance that stirs Passions, apply 
a –2 difficulty. Further, wraiths in the audience with relevant 
Passions may roll for Pathos gain. 

•  Seduce  [variable]:  Seducing  is  a  contrived  means  of 
becoming intimate with someone; your character plans each 
step and does not share any real emotion. The particular situ-
ation and style of seduction determines which Traits are used. 
Seduction is an involved process requiring several differ-

ent rolls:

Approach/Opening Line: First, roll your character’s Ap-
pearance + Subterfuge versus a difficulty equal to the subject’s 
Wits + 3. Each success beyond the first adds one die to your 
character’s dice pool for the next step. Failure means the subject 
isn’t interested.

Witty Repartee: Next, roll Wits + Subterfuge in a resisted

cess  beyond  the  first  adds  one  die  to  your  dice  pool  for  the 
final  roll.  Failure  means  the  subject  breaks  off  contact,  but 
may prove receptive at another time (you made a good first 
impression, after all).

Suggestive/Intimate Conversation: Finally, roll Charisma 
+ Persuasion versus a difficulty equal to the subject’s Perception 
+ 3. Success means the subject is enamored with your character 
and agrees to accompany her elsewhere for more intimate (and 
physical) interaction. What happens next is best handled with 
roleplaying (though use of Moliate does offer some fascinating 
possibilities…).

Note: a subject being seduced may use his Subterfuge score 

instead of the +3 listed with each of the rolls above.

A  botch  at  any  stage  of  seduction  means  the  subject  is 

disgusted or outraged by your crass moves. 

• Socialize [Charisma + Empathy]: Your character encour-
ages others to relax and enjoy themselves. This might include 
showing a potential ally a good time, loosening an informant’s 
tongue, or assuaging a stranger’s suspicions. This is a standard 
action, though the difficulty may increase when dealing with a 
large group and/or antagonistic audience. Certain Natures (Bon 
Vivant, Critic) can also influence the difficulty. On a botch, 
your character comes off as an obnoxious boor, or otherwise 
turns the subjects against her in some fashion.

Combat

onflict is inevitable in a game where you 
draw  upon  strong  emotions  for  power.  In 
Wraith, combat systems are designed to be 
flexible enough to reflect both the vicious 
reality  of  violence  and  the  spectacular 
manifestations of the supernatural.

As no rules can cover every possibility 
that may arise in battle, the Storyteller should be flexible when 
arbitrating combat situations. If the systems outlined here slow 
down gameplay or cause bickering, don’t use them. Conflict 
should occur among characters within the story, not between 
the players and Storyteller. 
Types of Combat

There are two types of combat. Each uses the same basic 

system, though with minor differences:
•  Close Combat: This covers unarmed combat (Dexterity + 
Brawl) and melee (Dexterity + Melee). Unarmed combat 
is  exactly  that:  any  fight  that  doesn’t  involve  weapons, 
whether a bar brawl or formal sparring. Opponents must 
be within touching distance (one yard/meter) to engage 
in unarmed combat. Melee involves handheld weapons, 
whether  a  baseball  bat  or  a  sword.  Opponents  must  be 
within two yards/meters to engage in melee.

•  Ranged Combat: Armed combat using projectile weapons 
of some sort —pistols, rifles, bows, thrown weapons, etc. 
Opponents must normally be within sight (and weapon 
range) of one another to engage in ranged combat. 
Note that you can use a ranged weapon in close combat. In 
turn, throwing a handheld weapon is considered ranged combat. 

Combat Turns

Combat is chaotic, with many things happening at once. 
This can get confusing in a game, though. So that it’s easier 
to keep track of things, Wraith divides combat into a series 
of turns. Each combat turn has three stages: Initiative, Action, 
and Resolution.
Combat Summary Chart

Stage One: Initiative

•  Roll initiative. All players and the Storyteller declare any 
character actions in reverse initiative order. The character 
with the highest initiative performs her action first. Actions 
can be delayed to any time later in the order of initiative. 
•  Declare any multiple actions (reduce dice pools according-
ly). Declare Arcanoi activation and Willpower expenditure.

Stage Two: Action

•  For unarmed close-combat attacks, roll Dexterity + Brawl.
•  For armed close-combat attacks, roll Dexterity + Melee.
•  For  ranged  combat,  roll  Dexterity  +  Firearms  (guns)  or 
Dexterity + Athletics (missile or thrown weapons).
•  A character can abort to a defensive action (block, dodge, 
parry)  at  any  time  before  her  action  is  performed.  This 
requires a successful Willpower roll, or expenditure of a 
Willpower point.

Stage Three: Resolution

•  Determine total damage effect (weapon type or maneuver); 
add any additional dice gained from extra successes on the 
attack roll.

•  Targets hit by attacks may attempt to soak damage, if ap-

propriate.

Stage One: Initiative

This stage organizes the turn, and is when the players and 
Storyteller each describe any actions they plan for their char-
acters. Various actions are possible —whether attacking with 
an axe, ducking behind a pillar, yelling a command, or even 
delaying in order to see what someone else does. 

Note that while you declare your character’s action in this 

stage, you don’t implement the action until the action stage.

To kick off the initiative stage, everyone involved in the 
combat  —player  and  Storyteller  alike  —rolls  one  die  and 
adds their initiative rating (Dexterity + Wits). The Storyteller’s 
single roll is applied separately to each Storyteller character’s 
initiative rating. 

326

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The results determine each character’s initiative score for 
the turn. The character with the highest result acts first, with 
the remaining characters acting in decreasing order of result. 
(If the Storyteller wants a faster method, she may forgo 
any dice rolls and determine initiative using each character’s 
Dexterity + Wits.)

If two characters get the same total, the one with the higher 
initiative rating goes first. If initiative ratings are also the same, 
the two characters act simultaneously. 

With initiative established, the Storyteller goes through the 
list in reverse order to have each player describe his character’s 
planned action. This gives faster characters the opportunity to 
react to slower characters’actions.

At  this  time,  you  must  also  state  whether  you  will  per-
form multiple actions, activate any Arcanoi, and/or spend any 
Willpower points. 

All  of  your  character’s  actions  occur  at  his  rank  in  the 

initiative order, with three exceptions: 
•  Delay Action: You can delay your character’s action to 
occur at any time after his designated rank in the initia-
tive —even to interrupt a slower character’s action. When 
you delay, your maneuvers happen whenever your character 
finally takes the action. If two characters both delay and 
subsequently act at the same time, the one with the higher 
initiative rating for the turn acts first.

•  Defensive Action: Your character may take a defensive 
action at any time as long as he has an action left in the 
turn (for further details, see “Abort Actions” p. 329, and 
“Defensive Maneuvers” on p. 330).

•  Multiple Actions: All additional actions occur at the end 
of the turn. If two or more characters take multiple actions, 
the actions occur at the end of the turn in order of initia-
tive rating. An exception is made for defensive multiple 
actions  —for  instance,  taking  multiple  dodges  —which 
occur in direct response to an attack action. 

Stage Two: Action

This is the heart of the combat turn. Here, you determine 
whether an action succeeds and what impact it has on the target 
(if any). An attack roll is made using a particular Attribute 
+ Ability combination appropriate to the type of combat in 
which your character is engaged:
•  Close  Combat:  Use  Dexterity  +  Brawl  (unarmed)  or 

Dexterity + Melee (armed).

•  Ranged Combat: Use Dexterity + Firearms (guns) or Dex-

terity + Athletics (missile or thrown weapons).
Remember,  simply  default  to  the  base  Attribute  if  your 

character doesn’t have points in the relevant Ability.

A weapon may modify your dice pool or difficulty (due 
to the challenge to use, rate of fire, etc.). Check the weapon’s 
statistics for details. 

DRAMA

327

Arcanoi use occurs at this stage as well. Apply relevant 
Arcanoi power effects on any maneuvers and rolls as appropriate.
Attacks are made versus difficulty 6, unless adjusted for situ-
ational modifiers (weapon type, long range, cramped quarters). 
If you get no successes, the character’s attack merely fails and 
inflicts no damage. If you botch, the character fails spectacu-
larly with a nasty result appropriate to the circumstance —the 
weapon jams, the blade breaks, an ally is hit, etc.

Stage Three: Resolution

In this stage, you determine the damage your character’s at-
tack inflicts, and the Storyteller describes what occurs in the turn. 
Normally, additional successes from a Trait roll mean that 
your character does something exceptionally well. In combat, 
each extra success on an attack roll equals one additional die 
that you add automatically to your damage dice pool. This can 
create cinematic —indeed, even lethal —results in combat.

Armor

to his Stamina. A wraith can soak bashing and lethal damage 
(mortals can only soak bashing damage). 

Only certain Arcanoi (largely expressions of Moliate and 
Outrage) can soak aggravated damage. These can also add to 
the defender’s soak rating against bashing and lethal damage.
Once  the  attacker  rolls  damage  for  a  successful  attack, 
the defender makes a soak roll to resist. This is considered a 
reflexive action: a soak attempt doesn’t require taking an action 
or splitting a dice pool.

Soak rolls are made versus difficulty 6, unless stated oth-
erwise. Each soak success reduces by 1 the damage inflicted, 
to a minimum of 1 level of damage. Any attack that strikes its 
target has at least a small chance of inflicting damage. As with 
damage rolls, soak rolls may not botch, only fail.

Damage Types

Every attack has a specific damage rating, indicating the num-
ber of dice to roll for the attack’s damage. This is called the damage 
dice pool. The attack maneuver dictates whether the damage dice 
pool is based on the attacker’s Strength or on the weapon used. 

Soak can reduce the damage rolled, but never to less than 
one die. Also, damage effect rolls cannot botch; a botched roll 
simply means the attack glances harmlessly off the target. 

Damage rolls are made versus difficulty 6. Each success on 
the roll inflicts 1 Corpus level of damage on the target. Damage 
is applied as one of three types, based on the attack:
•  Bashing: Punches and other blunt trauma that aren’t likely 
to destroy a target instantly. All characters use their full 
Stamina ratings to resist bashing effects, and each level of 
damage is recovered in one hour. Use a slash (“/”) to record 
bashing damage in the Corpus boxes on your character sheet. 
Once you run out of open Corpus boxes, any subsequent 
bashing damage is applied as a second slash (“\”) to create 
an “X,”thereby converting it to lethal damage.

•  Lethal: Attacks meant to cause immediate and fatal injury. 
Wraiths still use Stamina to resist lethal effects (though 
mortals may not); however, the damage takes longer to 
heal. Use an “X”to record lethal damage in the Corpus 
boxes on your character sheet.

•  Aggravated: Certain attacks are especially deadly to wraiths. 
Only armor or specific Arcanoi can soak aggravated dam-
age, and it takes a very long time to heal. Use an asterisk 
(“*”) to record aggravated damage in the Corpus boxes on 
your character sheet.

Characters have the chance to resist punishment; this is 
called soaking damage. Your character’s soak dice pool is equal 

Soak

328

The armor’s rating combines with your base soak for pur-
poses of reducing damage. Armor can protect against bashing, 
lethal, and aggravated physical attacks.

Armor is not indestructible. If the damage rolled in a single 
attack equals twice the armor’s rating, the armor is destroyed 
after soak is rolled.

penalty from all dice pools related to physical coordination and 
agility (most Dexterity-based dice pools, generally speaking). 
To bypass an opponent’s armor protection, an attacker may 
target an unprotected area. This incurs a +1 or +2 difficulty 
penalty, as determined by the Storyteller.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Object Corpus

Whether shaped in the soulforges or born as memories of 
things brought across the Shroud, all goods and structures have 
substance in the Underworld. This is translated as Corpus for 
game purposes. 

The amount of Corpus an object has is based on its size 
(for Skinlands objects, assume an equivalent number of health 
levels). The size categories listed below are benchmarks for ease 
of reference. More granular Corpus ratings may apply in some 
circumstances, including with vehicles (see the Relic Vehicle 
table, p. 319). Further, the Storyteller may adjust an object’s 
exact  Corpus  up  or  down  depending  on  various  factors:  the 
material it was made of originally, the strength of the emotion 
used to first create it, how long it has endured, whether it has 
suffered any damage, whether it is an Artifact, and so on. 

Soulforged and Stygian steel objects are more durable than 
the norm. Increase the Corpus for a soulforged object by 25%, 
and for a Stygian steel object by 50% (rounding up in each case). 
Object Corpus is handled the same as for a character, except 
that an object cannot recover any damage suffered. Instead, 
an object must be repaired (p. 323), although you can spend 
Pathos to “heal” a relic or Artifact. 

Apply  object  size  to  determine  the  damage  required  to 
destroy something. If the goal is to move, manipulate, or simply 
render an object inoperable, the Storyteller should use the ap-
propriate systems (see “Physical Feats,” p. 316). In either case, a 
damaged tool, weapon, or vehicle may suffer negative modifiers 
to its use, at the Storyteller’s discretion.

Combat Maneuvers

oleplaying combat is more entertaining if you 
visualize what your character does instead of 
simply rolling dice. These maneuvers give 
you  a  variety  of  options  in  combat.  Most 
require one action to execute.
Maneuver Conditions

This  section  addresses  circumstances  that  can  impact 

specific maneuvers performed in combat.

• Abort Action: Your character can abandon a declared 
action in favor of a defensive maneuver as long as he hasn’t 
already completed his action in the turn. Your character can 
abort to perform a block, dodge, or parry (see “Defensive Ma-
neuvers,” below, for descriptions of each). To abort, you must 
make a successful Willpower roll (this is considered a reflexive 
action), or spend 1 Willpower point when declaring the abort. 
•  Ambush:  Your  character  can  try  to  surprise  a  target 
and make a decisive first strike. Roll Dexterity + Stealth in a 
resisted action against the target’s Perception + Alertness. If 
you score more successes, you get one free attack roll on the 
target, adding any extra successes from the resisted roll to your 
attack dice pool. On a tie, you still attack first, although the 
target may perform a defensive maneuver. If the defender gets 
more successes, she spots the ambush and both parties determine 
initiative normally. Targets in combat cannot be ambushed.

•Blind Fight/Fire: Attacking while blind (or in pitch dark-
ness) incurs +2 difficulty, and ranged attacks cannot be made 
accurately at all. The Storyteller may allow wraith characters 
to use Sharpened Senses to counteract the effects of darkness, 
depending on the circumstances.

• Cover: Cover increases the difficulty of an attack, de-
pending on how much of your character’s body is hidden (see 
below).  The  trade-off  is  that  it  can  also  hamper  return  fire. 
Apply a –1 difficulty to ranged attacks that a defender makes 
under cover (so, no cover difficulty applies to a defender firing 
from a prone position). 

Cover modifiers are cumulative. So, if both combatants 
are lying prone but one is also behind a wall, attacks staged by 
the exposed prone character are at +3 difficulty, while attacks 
by the prone character behind the wall are at +2 difficulty.

Note that relic bullets and arrows have the equivalent of 
1 Corpus level. As such, relic ammunition fired through solid 
Skinlands objects discorporates as soon as it hits the “solid” 
object, doing no damage to any wraith hiding behind this cover.

Cover Type

Light (lying prone, behind pole)

Good (behind wall)

Superior (only head exposed)

OPTIONAL MANEUVER EFFECTS

If you’re open to a more cinematic style of 
combat,  you  may  choose  to  incorporate  these 
optional  maneuver  effects.  As  with  any  other 
rules,  they  are  meant  to  make  the  game  more 
engaging and fun, and should not be included if 
they slow things down or prove distracting.

•  Aerial Maneuver: Certain maneuvers require 
leaping, flying, or otherwise being in the air. 
When performing an aerial maneuver, sweeps 
and other crouching maneuvers cannot be 
used against you. Aerial maneuvers cannot 
hit opponents who are crouching or otherwise 
low to the ground. 

Associated Maneuvers: backflip, flying kick, 

flying tackle

• Crouching Maneuver: Certain maneuvers 
are performed very close to the ground. When 
performing a crouching maneuver, flying kicks 
and other aerial maneuvers cannot be used against 
you. Crouching maneuvers cannot hit opponents 
who are in the air or otherwise elevated. 

Associated Maneuvers: sweep, slide, tumble

•  Knockback:  Some  maneuvers  strike  with 
such force that they may move opponents 
backward. You may declare a knockback at-
tempt when making an attack. In this case, 
you apply extra successes from the attack to 
knockback  instead  of  damage:  For  every  2 
extra successes on the attack roll (discard-
ing any single extra successes), the target is 
pushed back one yard/meter and is considered 
staggered (p. 337). The opponent encoun-
ters any obstacles as appropriate from being 
knocked  back,  including  passing  through 
Skinlands  objects.  Knockback  cannot  be 
used on a throw maneuver.

Associated  Maneuvers:  charge,  haymaker, 
spinning  kick,  crossbow,  spear,  large-caliber 
pistol, shotgun

•  Movement:  You  may  have  your  character  move  half 
his  running  distance  and  still  take  an  action  in  a  turn.  The 
Storyteller may consider other maneuvers, such as leaping or 
tumbling, to be separate actions depending on their complexity.
• Multiple Actions: To declare multiple actions, first state 
the total number of actions your character will attempt. From 
this, determine which action’s dice pool is the smallest. Then, 
divide that number of dice between all of your actions. At the 
Storyteller’s discretion, later actions in a sequence may incur 
an  increased  difficulty.  See  Chapter  Three  (p.  95)  for  more 
information. If a character performs only defensive actions in 
a turn, use the relevant system for block, dodge, or parry.

• Multiple Opponents: A character who battles multiple 
opponents in close combat suffers a +1 difficulty to attack and 
defense for each opponent after the first. This is cumulative to 
a maximum of +4 difficulty.

• Range: The Ranged Weapons table (p. 338) lists the 
short range for each weapon; attacks within this range are made 
versus difficulty 6. The weapon’s maximum range is twice this 
distance, and attacks within this range are made versus difficulty 
8. Targets within two meters are in point-blank range, and at-
tacks within this range are made versus difficulty 4.

• Target: Targeting a specific object or location incurs an 
added difficulty. However, doing so can bypass armor or cover, 
or  can  result  in  an  increased  damage  effect.  The  Storyteller 
should  consider  special  results  beyond  a  simple  increase  in 
damage, depending on the attack and the target.

• The Tempest: All actions using Mental Traits are subject 
to +1 difficulty (maximum 9) while in the Tempest, since the 
moaning winds and buffeting turbulence make concentration 
and communication challenging. A Maelstrom may apply ad-
ditional modifiers and may even inflict damage to those caught 
within (p. 286). The Argos Arcanos is an exception to this rule.
Defensive Maneuvers

Attack rolls are made since it’s understood that characters 
try to avoid being hit in the course of a fight. Sometimes your 
character may want to focus only on avoiding attacks. There 
are three types of defensive actions: block, dodge, and parry. 

You can announce a defensive action during the initiative 
stage like any other action. Additionally, you can abort to a 
defensive maneuver at any time during the attack stage, as long 
as your character has an action remaining and your character’s 
opponent has not yet made the attack roll. An abort requires 

• Fend Off: It’s tough to get in range with fists or a knife 
if an opponent is wielding a sword or staff. A character in close 
combat who faces an opponent with a longer weapon must close 
within one yard/meter before striking, losing one die from his 
attack roll in the process.

• Flank/Rear Attack: When attacking a target’s flank, you 
gain one additional attack die. When attacking a target from 
the rear, you gain two additional attack dice.

a successful Willpower roll; if it fails, your character must carry 
out the original action that you declared. Alternately, you may 
spend 1 Willpower point to abort automatically.

Each defensive maneuver uses the same basic system: The 
defensive action is a resisted roll against the opponent’s attack 
roll. The attacker misses unless she gets more total successes. 
The  attacker  hits  if  she  gets  more  successes  than  you,  and 
adds these remaining extra successes to her damage roll. So, a 
defensive maneuver can still reduce an attack’s effectiveness 
even if it doesn’t avoid it outright.

It is not always possible to avoid an attack. You can’t dodge 
when there’s no room to maneuver, and you can’t block or parry 
if you don’t know an attack is coming.

Block,  dodge,  and  parry  can  be  performed  as  part  of  a 
multiple  action  on  your  character’s  turn  —punching  then 
blocking, shooting then dodging, parrying then striking. It’s a 
good option if you don’t want to rely on your character’s base 
soak but would like to actually do something more than just 
avoid attacks.

If you declare that your character is being fully defensive 
for the turn, the normal rules for multiple actions do not apply. 
Instead, you get a full dice pool for the first defensive action, 
then remove one die cumulatively for each subsequent defense 
action made in the same turn. This gives your character a much 
better chance of avoiding attacks for the turn.

Remember that difficulty penalties apply to dealing with 
multiple attackers, even for defensive actions (see “Multiple 
Opponents,”p. 330).

• Block: This maneuver uses your character’s own body to 
deflect a hand-to-hand bashing attack. Your character cannot 
block lethal or aggravated attacks unless he’s wearing armor 
and/or has Arcanoi active. 

Difficulty: Normal

Traits: Dexterity + Brawl 
• Dodge: This maneuver is handy for avoiding all types of 
attacks. To avoid Brawl or Melee attacks, your character ducks, 
spins, weaves, or even flips out of the way (you must block or 
parry if there’s no room to maneuver). In a firefight, your char-
acter moves at least one yard/meter and ends up behind cover 
(or drops to the ground if there’s no room to move or no cover 
available). If your character remains under cover or prone, cover 
rules apply against further ranged attacks (see “Cover,” p. 329).
Traits: Dexterity + Athletics  Difficulty: Normal

• Parry: With this maneuver, your character uses a weapon 
to block a Brawl or Melee attack. You may also use parry to 
deflect a thrown weapon attack, at the Storyteller’s discretion. 
If your character uses a weapon that causes lethal or aggravated 
damage to parry a Brawl attack, the attacker may suffer injury. 
The attack and parry rolls are considered a resisted action. If 
you get more successes, roll the weapon’s base damage plus the 
parry’s extra successes as a damage dice pool against the attacker.

Traits: Dexterity + Melee 

Difficulty: Normal

Close Combat Maneuvers

This section lists common maneuvers that occur in close 
combat. Feel free to work with the Storyteller in developing 
your own moves. 

All  hand-to-hand  attacks  inflict  bashing  damage  unless 
stated otherwise. Melee damage depends on the weapon type 
(see the Melee Weapons table, p. 335). Most melee weapons 
inflict lethal damage, though clubs and other blunt instruments 
inflict bashing damage.

MANEUVER CHARACTERISTICS

Maneuvers  are  performed  versus  difficulty 
6, unless stated otherwise. Some combat effects 
may modify your attack roll, difficulty, or damage 
dice pool. Each maneuver description includes 
the following characteristics, as relevant.

Traits: The Trait combination used for the 
action  taken.  If  your  character  doesn’t  have  a 
rating in the needed Ability, simply default to 
its base Attribute.

Accuracy:  Any  dice  added  to  the  roll  to 
hit an opponent. A “+3”adds three dice to that 
attack’s dice pool.

Difficulty:  Any  additions  or  subtractions 
to the attack’s base difficulty (typically a 6). A 
“+2”means the attack’s difficulty goes up by 2 — 
so, difficulty 6 becomes difficulty 8.

Damage: The damage dice pool used. If this is 
listed as “Special,”read the maneuver description 
for details on the maneuver’s outcome.

The  Storyteller  may  modify  a  maneuver’s  difficulty  and 
damage, depending on your character’s combat style and how 
you describe a planned action. As always, drama and excitement 
take precedence over rules systems.

• Claw: This maneuver is available only to characters with 
claws — such as a wraith who has warped his Corpus to create 
talons or spikes. A wraith’s claws inflict aggravated damage and 
may stagger an opponent.

•  Bite:  This  maneuver  is  available  only  to  characters 
with sharp teeth — for example, a Spectre or a wraith who has 
Moliated his Corpus to create fangs. To perform a bite attack, 
your character must first perform a successful clinch, hold, or 
tackle maneuver (see below). If successful, on the following 
turn you may declare the bite attempt. A wraith’s bite inflicts 
aggravated damage.

• Breakfall: Your character can attempt a breakfall when 
he  would  otherwise  suffer  damage  directly  from  a  fall.  This 
is a reflexive action. For each success rolled, add one die to 
your dice pool to soak falling damage. This maneuver requires 
training to perform correctly, so the Storyteller may restrict its 
use  to  characters  trained  in  an  appropriate  martial  art  (e.g., 
aikido, jujutsu).

goes into a clinch with the target. In the first turn, you may 
roll Strength damage. In each subsequent turn, combatants 
act on their orders in the initiative. Either combatant can 
choose  to  inflict  Strength  damage  automatically  or  try  to 
escape the clinch. No other actions are allowed until one 
combatant breaks free.

To escape a clinch, make a resisted Strength + Brawl roll 
against the opponent. If the escaping character has more suc-
cesses, she breaks free; otherwise, the characters continue to 
grapple in the next turn.

• Disarm: This maneuver targets your opponent’s weapon. 
On a successful attack at +1 difficulty, roll damage normally. If 
the result exceeds the target’s Strength rating, your opponent 
takes no damage — instead, she is disarmed. A botch usually

• Ground  Fighting: You may employ this maneuver to 
fight while prone. On a successful reflexive Dexterity + Ath-
letics roll, your character may ignore the reduced damage dice 
pool for close combat maneuvers while prone (see p. 337). At 
the Storyteller’s discretion, certain maneuvers may suffer from 
increased difficulty or may not even be performed. This ma-
neuver requires training to perform correctly, so the Storyteller 
may restrict its use to characters with an appropriate martial 
arts background.

Damage: None

Traits: Dexterity + Athletics  Difficulty: Normal
Accuracy: Normal 
• Hold: This maneuver inflicts no damage, as the intent 
is to immobilize rather than injure. On a successful roll, your 
character holds his opponent until the target’s next action. At 
that time, both combatants roll resisted Strength + Brawl ac-
tions. The target remains immobilized (unable to take any other 
action) until she rolls more successes than the attacker does.

Traits: Strength + Brawl

kicks to aerial spins. The Storyteller may choose to increase the

maneuver’s base difficulty and/or damage depending on how 
complex you describe the attack (e.g., axe kick, flying kick, heel 
stamp, knee strike, roundhouse kick). Kicks may stagger a target.

Difficulty: +1

• Strike: This covers any type of fist attack, from a sloppy 
punch to a judo chop. The Storyteller may choose to increase

type of strike (e.g., elbow smash, haymaker, head butt, hook, 
jab, karate strike). Strikes may stagger a target.

• Sweep: On a successful attack roll, your character knocks 
the legs out from under his opponent. The target takes damage 
and must roll Dexterity + Athletics (difficulty 8) or be knocked 
prone (see “Maneuver Complications,” p. 336).

Damage applied depends on how the maneuver is executed. 
Your character simply using his body (sweeping with arm or 
legs) inflicts Strength damage, while using an implement (staff, 
chain, etc.) inflicts damage per the weapon type.

• Tackle: Your character tries to tackle his op-
ponent to the ground. After applying damage from 
the  maneuver,  both  combatants  roll  Dexterity  + 
Athletics (difficulty 7) or are knocked prone (see 
“Maneuver  Complications,”  p.  336).  Even  if  the 
target’s Athletics roll succeeds, she is unbalanced and 
suffers +1 difficulty to her actions for the next turn.
Traits: Strength + Brawl  Difficulty: +1
Accuracy: Normal 

Damage: Strength +1;  
Knocked prone
 
• Combat Throw: On a successful attack roll, 
your character grabs and throws his opponent in a 
single move, flinging the opponent at a desired spot 
on the ground or into an obstruction. Do not apply 
extra successes from the attack roll to damage. Rather, 
for every 2 successes rolled, your character throws 
an opponent of up to equal size one yard/meter. If 
your character hits but does not succeed in getting 
any distance, the opponent is thrown to the ground 
where she was standing. The opponent is knocked 
prone and suffers Strength damage from the force of 
impact, and encounters any obstacles as appropriate 
(including passing through Skinlands objects). 

For  every  size  category  that  the  opponent  is 
larger than the attacker, reduce the throw distance 
by one yard/meter (see “Object Corpus,” p. 329; a 
wraith is average size). The Storyteller may choose to 
increase the throw distance one or two yards/meters 
if an opponent has significant momentum already, 
such as running or leaping.

 

Traits: Strength + Brawl  Difficulty: +1
Accuracy: Normal 

Damage: Strength;  
Knocked prone
 
• Trap: Your character uses his hands or a weapon 
to halt an opponent’s close combat attack by liter-
ally catching it. This is a resisted action; if you get 
more successes, both attacking implements are held 
until the next character’s action. At that time, both 
combatants roll resisted actions (yours remains at +2 
difficulty). Both combatants’ attacking implements 
(whether limbs or weapons) remain immobilized until 
one party rolls more successes and chooses to break 
the trap. Alternately, if the implement is a weapon, 
the trap is broken if one combatant simply lets go. 
Instead of maintaining the trap, your character may 
try a disarm on his next action, applying extra suc-
cesses from the trap to the disarm attempt. 

On  a  tie,  your  character  simply  deflects  the 
attacking  implement,  similar  to  a  block  or  parry. 
If you fail, the attacker uses their roll as the attack 
roll to hit.

Ranged Combat Maneuvers

Difficulty: Normal
Damage: Weapon type

This section covers common maneuvers that occur in a 
firefight. As with close combat, you’re encouraged to suggest 
new ranged combat maneuvers for the Storyteller’s approval. 
Weapons may apply modifiers to attack or damage rolls 

(see the Ranged Weapons table, p. 338).

• Aim: For each turn spent aiming, add one die to your 
character’s attack dice pool on a single shot, up to a maximum 
equal to his Perception rating. A scope adds 2 dice to the attack 
pool. Your character must have at least Firearms 1 (if using a 
gun) or Athletics 1 (if using a bow or sling) to use this maneu-
ver. Your character may do nothing but aim during this time, 
and cannot aim at a target that is moving faster than a walk.
Trait: Dexterity + Firearms/Athletics Difficulty: Normal
Accuracy: Special 
•  Automatic  Fire:  If  your  character  has  an  automatic 
weapon with at least a half-full ammunition magazine, he can 
unleash it all in one attack against a single target. While your 
character gains 10 dice to accuracy, the weapon’s recoil applies 
a +2 difficulty. Extra successes add to the damage dice pool, 
which is treated as a single attack for the purposes of soak. Your 
character may not target a specific body part using automatic 
fire. Automatic fire may stagger a target.

C = Greek fire burns for a number of turns equal to the 

extra successes rolled, inflicting the listed damage each turn.

E = The explosive detonates upon impact, inflicting the 
listed damage in a two-yard/meter radius. Extra successes from 
the attack roll do not apply to the damage roll; instead, every 
2 extra successes rolled increases the explosion radius an ad-
ditional one yard/meter.

Damage: The weapon’s damage dice pool. Weapons inflict 

lethal damage unless indicated otherwise. 

Range: The medium range in yards/meters. A weapon may 
be thrown twice this distance, up to the character’s Strength, 
but such attacks are considered long range (difficulty 8).

Rate:  The  maximum  number  that  can  be  thrown  in  a 
single turn. More than one throw in a single turn requires a 
multiple action.

Conceal: P = Can be carried in the pocket; J = Can be 
hidden in a jacket; T = Can be hidden in a trenchcoat; N = 
Cannot be concealed on a person.

Pathos  Use:  The  Pathos  cost  required  to  activate  the 
weapon for the duration of a scene. Explosives cannot be reused 
once detonated.

• Catch: With this maneuver, your character catches an 
opponent’s thrown weapon attack. This is a resisted action; if 
you get more successes, you’ve caught the thrown implement 
safely. On a tie, you merely deflect it. If you fail, the attacker 
uses their roll as the attack roll to hit. At the Storyteller’s dis-
cretion, additional difficulty may apply to catch particularly 
small and/or fast-moving projectiles. This maneuver requires 
training to perform correctly, so the Storyteller may restrict its 
use to characters with an appropriate martial arts background.
Your character cannot catch lethal or aggravated thrown 
weapon attacks unless his hands are armored and/or if he has 
Moliated his hands into claws. 
Traits: Dexterity + Athletics 
Accuracy: Normal 

Difficulty: +2
Damage: Special

• Multiple Shots: Your character can shoot at more than 
one target in a single turn (use maneuvers like automatic fire and 
three-round burst for multiple attacks against the same target). 
Divide your attack dice pool by the number of shots you want to 
fire at the same number of targets, up to the weapon’s maximum 
rate of fire. Each attack is then rolled separately.

Ability: Dexterity + Firearms 
Accuracy: Special 
•  Reload:  Reloading  a  weapon  takes  one  full  turn  and 
requires concentration. Like any other maneuver, a reload can 
be performed as part of a multiple action.

Difficulty: Normal
Damage: Weapon type

• Strafe: If your character has an automatic weapon with 
at least a half-full ammunition magazine, he can strafe an area 
up  to  three  yards/meters  in  size.  This  empties  the  magazine 
and incurs a +2 difficulty due to recoil, but you gain 10 dice to 
accuracy on a standard attack roll. 

Divide any successes from the attack roll evenly among 
all targets in the covered area, with any leftover successes as-
signed as you desire. If fewer successes are rolled than there are 
targets, you may assign only 1 success per target until they are 
all allocated. Assigned successes are also added to the damage 
dice pool against that target (if only one target is within the 
area, apply only half the successes). 

Difficulty: +2
Damage: Special

Targets being strafed incur a +1 difficulty to dodge.
Trait: Dexterity + Firearms 
Accuracy: +10 
• Three-Round Burst: You gain two additional dice on a 
single attack roll by expending three shots from the weapon’s 
magazine.  The  weapon’s  recoil  applies  a  +1  difficulty.  Extra 
successes add to the damage dice pool, which is treated as a 
single attack for the purposes of soak. Only certain weapons 
may perform this maneuver (see the Ranged Weapons table, 
p. 338). A three-round burst may stagger a target.

Difficulty: +1
Damage: Weapon type

Trait: Dexterity + Firearms 
Accuracy: +2 
• Two Weapons: Firing two weapons at once is considered 
a multiple action, complete with dividing the dice of the lowest 
pool between two different targets. Your character also suffers +1 
difficulty with his off-hand (unless he’s ambidextrous). Each attack 
is rolled and resolved separately (use automatic fire and three-
round burst for multiple attacks made against the same target).
Difficulty: +1 (off-hand)
Damage: Weapon type

Maneuver Complications

This section covers common combat complications. The 

Storyteller should add others as the situation warrants.

•Blinded:  Add  two  dice  to  attack  rolls  made  against  a 
blinded target. In turn, a blinded character is at +2 difficulty 
on all actions.

•Dazed: A target is dazed if, after soak, he suffers a number 
of damage successes on a single attack greater than his Stamina 

336

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

+ 2 (or simply Stamina, for mortals). The target loses his next 
available turn as he shakes off the attack’s effect. Attacks against 
dazed targets are made at +1 accuracy. At the Storyteller’s discre-
tion, a dazed target may spend 1 Willpower point to overcome 
the effect instead of losing his turn.

• Staggered: A powerful impact can stagger a target. If 
the attacker rolls a number of successes on a single damage roll 
greater than the target’s Strength (based on the damage result 
prior to the defender’s soak), the target must make a Dexterity 
+ Athletics roll to maintain his footing. If the target fails, he 
staggers backward one yard/meter or is even knocked prone, at 
the Storyteller’s discretion.

•Immobilized: Add two dice to attack rolls made on a target 
who is immobilized but still struggling (e.g., being grappled, 
handcuffed). Attacks hit automatically if the target is totally 
immobilized (e.g., bound completely, paralyzed, unconscious). 

• Prone: A target who is knocked down, thrown, or falls 
is considered prone. Close combat attacks against a prone tar-
get are made at +1 accuracy, while ranged attacks are made at 
+1 difficulty due to cover (p. 329). A character may perform 
maneuvers while prone, but is at –2 initiative and reduces his 
damage dice pool by 2 for any close combat damage he inflicts. 
The  Storyteller  may  declare  that  a  prone  character  cannot 
perform a combat throw or certain other maneuvers. 

A character may get back on his feet immediately after be-
ing knocked prone by making a successful Dexterity + Athletics 
roll, but is at –2 initiative in the next turn. On a failed roll, 
the subject must spend his next action climbing to his feet if 
he wants to stand. On a botch, he lands particularly hard or 
at a severe angle, taking 1 automatic level of bashing damage.

Book Three

pectres are the servants of Oblivion. They 
creep out of the Tempest through Nihils 
and lurk in the dark corners of Necropoli 
to seduce and destroy. They serve Oblivion 
directly by carrying out the commands of 
their Malfean masters, and indirectly by 
destroying every soul they can sink their 
claws into. With each soul lost, so goes the faith, knowledge, 
and power to keep Oblivion at bay. Spectres strive for the 
time at which the last great Maelstrom will sweep through 
the Underworld, scouring the last vestiges of the realms of 
the Restless until only Oblivion remains.

But Spectres are more than merely a buzzing hive mind 
of insanity in thrall to Oblivion. Also called the Shadow-
Eaten, they are reflections of the wraithly condition, beings 
who  embrace  their  dark  urges  and  who  understand  that 
Oblivion  is  the  ultimate  fate  that  awaits  us  all.  And,  like 
wraiths, Spectres have unfinished business to take care of 
before succumbing to the Void.

Spectres are creatures of unbridled emotion, of dark rage 
and complex melancholy. They are cold, cruel, and twisted. 
They exist to inflict their pain upon others, and to end their 
own  pain  through  the  extinction  of  all  reality.  Along  the 
way, they can also be sadistic, terrifying, sardonic, and even 
pathetic. But they are never, ever not dangerous.

Chapter 10:  SpectresSpectral History

ccording  to  runes  carved  in  the  walls  of 
the  beating  heart  of  the  Labyrinth,  the 
first  Spectres  were  born  from  the  pain  of 
Life’s  separation  from  Death.  These  were 
the  Neverborn  Malfeans,  Oblivion  made 
incarnate.  Birthed  in  agony,  they  desired 
only an end to their pain even at the cost of 
all existence. Their tunneling beneath the Shadowlands created 
the Labyrinth, their home and hunting grounds.

As  Charon  declared  sovereignty  over  the  masses  of  the 
dead in the Shadowlands above, so the Malfeans established 
dominance over their subjects in the Tempest below. The souls 
devoured by Oblivion were forged into armies that ventured 
forth to wrest cargos of souls from the Ferrymen. Oblivion grew 
stronger with each captured soul that was flung into the Void. In 
response, Charon ventured alone down the Veinous Stair and 
deep into the Labyrinth. Some Spectres claim that Charon swore 
secret allegiance after the Malfeans foretold that his fate was 
to be devoured by the Void unless he joined forces with them.
Whatever the truth, it is evident that Charon’s rule failed 
to  stave  off  Oblivion  —  indeed,  it  even  encouraged  it.  His 
authoritarian  methods  fomented  rebellion,  which  strength-
ened the Shadows of Stygia’s citizens. When his agents aided 
the legions of Rome and encouraged the deaths of countless 
mortals in battle, many of the resulting souls were swallowed 
by Oblivion. The passage at one time of so many souls ripped 
open the Tempest, and through such wounds did the Maelstroms 
escape. Caused by the deaths of thousands, each Maelstrom 
claimed many thousand more souls for Oblivion.

During the Third Great Maelstrom, an army of Spectres 
under  the  notorious  General  Coldheart  launched  an  assault 
against Stygia itself. While ultimately repulsed, they managed 
to infect the very darkness itself to rise up against the defending 
Legions. That darkness surrounds Stygia even to the present, 
where it roils with the Passions and memories of the souls that 
succumbed to Oblivion during the battle.

Spectres  next  triumphed  during  the  Great  War  of  the 
Skinlands, when the carnage in the trenches, on land, and at 
sea unleashed the Fourth Great Maelstrom. The shrieking winds 
carried an army of Spectres throughout the Shadowlands and the 
Dark Kingdoms. Many lesser Necropoli fell, and the Shadow-
Eaten infiltrated many more. Oblivion grew ever stronger while 
the Shadowlands decayed even further, reflecting the despair 
that continental war spread across the Skinlands.

Even that was as nothing compared to World War II. The 
years of atrocities in both the European and Pacific theaters 
became the thudding drumbeat of doom as thousands of souls 
streamed across the Shroud. It built to a crescendo as the atomic 
bombs dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki triggered shock 
waves that tore the Tempest asunder. All sense and substance 

were gone; the Labyrinth’s depths were exposed and, borne on 
the wings of the Fifth Great Maelstrom, the oldest Malfean 
of all, Gorool, woke from an eternity of sleep and burst out of 
the Tempest.

Charon took the battle to this most ancient of beasts, and, 
though victorious, was lost. Spectres claim that this fight was 
simply part of Charon’s original betrayal from millennia before. 
Even now, they chortle, Charon lurks deep in the Labyrinth 
where he marshals Spectral armies in preparation for an apoca-
lyptic assault on the Shadowlands.

While few wraiths believe such ravings, there is no doubt 
that Stygia stands weakened in Charon’s absence. Nihils open 
in every Necropolis, from which slip Doppelgangers, Shades, 
and other horrors. The Tempest grows thicker with the Shadow-
Eaten than ever before, including a new breed called Mortwights. 
They all work feverishly to undermine the security of Stygia and 
disrupt the uneasy peace of its citizens till the day in which the 
last Great Maelstrom will erupt, and Oblivion shall claim all.

Damned Existence

The Shadow-Eaten know they have limited time before 
they succumb to the Void’s cold hunger. The manner in which 
Spectres cope with this is as varied as the Dark Passions that 
drive them. Some embrace reckless behavior, from rampaging 
through  Necropoli  to  mounting  suicidal  assaults  on  Stygian 
Legions. Others are content to let Oblivion claim them in its 
own time, and pursue their own dark urges until that day arrives. 
Regardless, all are evil, implacable, and without mercy. Nothing 
can rival these creatures for their sheer malice. Spectres are the 
agents of entropy, leavened with sadism.

Birth of a Spectre

A mortal who dies in especially violent circumstances or a 
wraith whose Shadow claims her is “reborn” as a Spectre. This 
is more than a simple physical transformation. The individual’s 
personality and psychological makeup, as well as her very physical 
form, are dissolved and rebuilt with the stuff of Oblivion itself. 
The specifics vary from Spectre to Spectre — some emerge as 
monstrosities, their Corpus scalded, warped, and stretched into 
a walking nightmare, while others seem little different save for 
the evidence of their death seared permanently upon them — 
but all bear the unmistakable mark of Oblivion.

The character’s Nature and Demeanor — and the Shadow’s 
archetype if the character was already a wraith — are the key 
variables in determining the Spectral outcome. Other elements, 
including  the  circumstances  of  the  character’s  death,  any 
postmortem adventures they may have had, and any contacts 
they had with the forces of Oblivion prior to transformation 
may also play a part.

When a mortal is claimed by Oblivion through violent 
death, or when a wraith’s Shadow achieves a 10 permanent 
Angst  rating,  the  character  is  swallowed  by  the  Tempest  in 
order to metamorphose into her Shadow-Eaten form. She lies

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Spectres can wait ages to be released from their 
cocoons. The Tempest is vast and the chances of 
being found are lower than you might think, leav-
ing newly minted Shadow-Eaten trapped inside 
their lightless prisons for months or even years. 
The longer a Spectre spends waiting for release, 
the more likely it is to have gone quite mad while 
waiting, which can have terrible consequences for 
anyone who releases one even above and beyond 
the usual attack of Rapacity. It is said that there 
are some cocoons that have been floating in the 
Tempest for hundreds, if not thousands of years. 
What will emerge from them, no one knows.

dormant while a dark cocoon made from the very stuff of the 
storm itself surrounds her. Once it hardens, the cocoon rises, 
glossy and translucent, to the surface of the Tempest, where 
it bobs on the currents until it’s either opened or destroyed. 
The  thick  shell  is  extremely  difficult  to  crack.  Only  rarely 
has a Spectre freed herself from it without aid. Those who do 
become figures of great import and weighty destiny, such as the 
Nephwrack General Coldheart.

Breaking open a cocoon from inside is an extended action 
using Strength + Occult (difficulty 9), and requires 5 successes. 
On a botch, the cocoon re-forms over the weakened spot, wiping 
away all successes accumulated to that point. Bear in mind that 
a botch causes the character to lose 1 permanent Corpus level 
(see “Brief Life,” p. 348). Indeed, Spectres have been known to 
destroy themselves in the act of trying to hatch from a cocoon.
As such, most Spectres are forced to wait, floating on the 
tides of the Tempest until someone discovers and frees them, 
or a Maelstrom does the job for them. A cocoon ruptures more 
easily from the outside, cracking open upon suffering at least 5 
lethal Corpus levels of damage.

With  rebirth  comes  a  connection  to  the  Spectral  hive 
mind,  so  other  Shadow-Eaten  often  pick  up  on  the  distress 
that  the  fledgling  broadcasts.  Their  intervention  is  far  from 
altruistic — rather, it’s a desire to stop the nagging panic that 
pierces the mass mind.

Rarely do wraiths encounter an intact cocoon. Those un-
aware of what it holds are usually in for an unpleasant surprise 
should they crack it open. An undamaged cocoon, however, 
can fetch quite a few oboli, so most savvy wraiths simply sell 
it off to the Hierarchy or a Guild for further study. And there 
are always private collectors in Stygia and elsewhere who want 
larval Spectres for their own purposes.

No Spectres remember precisely what happens to them in 
the cocoon. Some suppose that the Spectre is driven into frenzy 
by the ceaseless whispers of Oblivion, her greatest Dark Passion 
fanned to white-hot intensity. Others claim that Oblivion has 

no inherent consciousness, and a Spectre’s manic state is the 
result of the transformation itself. Regardless of conjecture, a 
Spectre emerges from her cocoon disoriented, drenched in a 
viscous plasm — and shrieking in the grip of Rapacity (p. 349) 
to the point where she attacks her very liberators. Her fellow 
Spectres usually make a game of it, employing defensive maneu-
vers or nonlethal Arcanoi to play a kind of “keep away” until 
the fledgling Spectre calms down. Wraiths who free a Spectre 
aren’t as understanding — or as likely to survive.

Spectre Motivation

The Hierarchy claims that faith, knowledge, and identity 
stave off Oblivion. Spectres know this to be true, and so they 
seek to destroy faith, erase knowledge, and eradicate individual 
identity to bring Oblivion ever closer. By spreading cynicism, 
hopelessness, and lack of faith in gods and governments alike, 
Spectres advance Oblivion’s cause.

Spectres view Oblivion as a force to be encouraged, not 
feared. What comes after the end of everything? Few Spectres 
bother to even wonder. All that matters is that their torment 
will  end  at  last.  However,  if  surcease  from  pain  were  all  a 
Spectre  sought,  self-destruction  would  be  easy  enough.  The 
spark  of  Oblivion  within  them  makes  them  want  to  end  it 
all — to take others with them on their spiraling descent into 
nothingness  until  all  that’s  left  is  the  sentient  void.  This  is 
what drives Spectres to sack Necropoli and ambush travelers 
in the Tempest, the terrible desire to end not only their own 
existences but everyone else’s as well.

Some  Malfeans  perpetuate  the  concept  of  Oblivion  as 
sentient, a deity incarnate, and claim to be its priests. Others 
promote themselves as gods — sometimes to Spectres, but most 
often  to  misguided  mortal  cultists  and  deluded  supernatural 
disciples.

Regardless  of  creed,  all  Shadow-Eaten  serve  Oblivion. 
Every action they take is with the goal of spreading entropy and 
destruction, so that one day the Void will devour all existence.

PATIENCE

It is a mistake to assume that Spectres are 
creatures of the moment. Oblivion hungers, but 
it is also patient, knowing that it will devour all in 
the end. As a result, many of its best servants are 
patient as well, drawing up decades-long plans to 
subvert and destroy Heretic cults, Necropoli, or 
notable wraiths, all in the service of the greater 
glory of the Void. A group of young wraiths who 
accidentally blunder into the machinations of one 
of these Spectral masterminds may find themselves 
in for more trouble than they’re ready for.

SPECTRES

Spectre Tactics

As described in subsequent sections, Spectres of various castes 
tend to focus on different missions as agents of Oblivion. Some of 
the more common pursuits are outlined here, including references 
to key Arcanoi and Dark Arcanoi used in their execution. This is 
far from an exhaustive list. After all, the Underworld is a vast place, 
where all manner of shocking encounters can occur even in the most 
seemingly innocuous of places.
Byway Robbery

As the only stable paths through the Tempest, Byways are a 
primary means of travel for wraiths. Emissaries of all factions use 
Byways to make their way from Hierarch Necropolis to Dark King-
dom outpost, from Renegade fortress to Heretic shrine. Byways also 
make ideal spots for Spectral ambush. After all, it’s much easier to 
attack wraiths deep in the Spectre-haunted territory of the Tempest 
than by raiding some Citadel.

One  tactic  involves  using  Wormhole  (Tempest  Weaving,  p. 
357) to open a Nihil in the middle of a Byway, from which Spectres 
spew forth in a violent swarm.

Another approach is to lurk off a Byway, then pounce upon 
travelers from within the Tempest itself. When attacking from the 
roiling chaos of the Tempest, Spectres gain 5 dice to their ambush 
attempts (Combat Maneuvers, p. 329).

Where the Tempest resembles a turbulent sea, Spectres may 
burst from the waves to drag targets from their vessels or even steer 
relic ships of their own to ram and sink their enemies.

Since Doppelgangers can pass as wraiths, these deceivers often 
slip among groups traveling on Byways to attack from within, or 
simply join the caravan to infiltrate a citadel. Some even drag off 
stragglers and take their place beside their unsuspecting companions.
Necropolis Infiltration

Since Doppelgangers can pass as wraiths, they often lead covert 
Spectre incursions into Necropoli. A common ploy is for the Spectre 
to enter a Necropolis in a group of wraiths, and establish herself as 
a provider of a rare Arcanos such as Mnemosynis or Usury (p. 190, 
217). In trade, the Spectre receives information, thereby learning 
much about the Necropolis and its inhabitants — security, figures 
of influence, prejudices — that Spectres can exploit.

Another approach is to use Moliate (p. 196) to take the place 
of a wraith, typically someone with political or social standing. From 
this position, the Spectre can sow dissent and pit rivals against one 
another until the wraiths become so focused on each other that they 
are utterly unprepared to meet a Spectral incursion at the gates.

Doppelgangers are also on the lookout for wraiths whose Shadows 
are strong, and use arts such as Castigate and Contaminate (p. 155, 
350) in an effort to trigger the long fall into Oblivion.

A Shade might take the lead on especially sensitive missions, 
infiltrating with Chameleon Parasite (Shadecraft, p. 358). For the 
most part, though, this is the Doppelganger’s bailiwick.

346

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Soul Harvesting

With mortals, Spectres’ primary pursuit is to cultivate and 
eventually harvest the Oblivion that lurks within their souls. 
Although seldom able to actually see mortals beyond the Shroud, 
Spectres use Corruption and Larceny powers (p. 351, 352) to 
sense those who hunger for darkness.

Spectres  employ  Emotional  Infection  (Larceny,  p.  352) 
to implant and nurture Dark Passions within mortals. As the 
mortals’ levels of Dark Passions grow, making them increasingly 
aggressive, cruel, fearful, or homicidal, Spectres feed upon the 
emotions generated.

A mortal’s psychotic break often triggers Rapacity in any 
nearby Spectres (p. 349). Such Spectral assaults are often the 
basis for stories of vengeful ghosts who cause victims to liter-
ally die of fright.

Haunting an area is also effective, whether the site of the 
Spectre’s death or wandering the Shadowlands. Spectres may 
use  the  Embody  or  Pandemonium  Arcanoi  (p.  159,  204)  as 

well as Maleficence or Shroud Rending Dark Arcanoi (p. 354, 
355) to manifest as menacing figures, cold spots, bad dreams, 
bloodcurdling  screams  and  the  like,  before  dispatching  any 
mortals  who  wander  by.  Materializing  in  the  road  to  panic 
unwary drivers into an accident is also a favorite.

Spectres and Their Kind

hile  individual  Spectre  existence  is  brief, 
a complex social order has developed over 
time, based on caste. In this highly structured 
society,  the  Shadow-Eaten  obey  a  system 
upheld not by violence and coercion, but by 
intensity of emotion. The stronger the Dark 
Passions a Spectre has, the more respected it 
is among members of its own caste, though such influence never 
crosses caste boundaries. Malfeans occupy the highest caste, 
followed by Shades, Nephwracks, and finally Doppelgangers.

ARCANOI DIRTY TRICKS

There are any number of ways that Spectres can use Arcanoi and Dark Arcanoi to make afterlife hell for 
wraiths. The examples here are just the tip of the iceberg. Players and Storytellers are encouraged to come 
up with their own devious machinations.

•  Collogue: First, weasel your way in among a bunch of wraiths. Then, when they’re relaxing, send out a 
call for help. It’s even better if you mix in the Gleaming Intimation and get the wraiths to run toward a 
Nihil just as their uninvited guests arrive. Other Spectres may get irritated if you do this too often, though, 
so be careful or you might get added to the buffet line.

•  Contaminate: What better way to mess with a wraith than to get her own darker half to help? Call the 
Shadow is certain to give a wraith a bad day, but it’s not for the faint of will. Not powerful enough to 
drag the Shadow into control? No worries, a quick infusion with Transfer Angst can give the Shadow all 
it needs to kick off Catharsis on its own.

• 

Intimation:  What easier way is there to manipulate a wraith than to discover what she really, really 
wants? That’s just the beginning. You can use this Arcanos to make her want something else (like a “live” 
relic grenade), or strip her of a desire (like wanting to stick you with something pointy). Loads of fun, if 
you can put up with your eyes glowing green — not to mention finding someone to teach you; the hive 
mind’s a bit fuzzy on this one.

•  Mnemosynis: Chock full of useful arts, but Mnemotechnics is always a solid choice. If you’re in a tight 
spot, simply pop your attacker back to the memory of her death. While she’s reliving that grand old time, 
you can go about your business (or stick around and soak up some nice, strong emotions). If you want to 
do a real double whammy, have a Doppelganger buddy follow this up looking like one of the major players 
from her past. Her cortex will be scrambled eggs before you can say “dirty pool.”

•  Pandemonium: This Arcanos has tons of options for confusing and disorienting your victim. For instance, 
say someone’s close to figuring out your true nature, or about to take some action you’d rather they didn’t 
(like hammering you into lawn furniture). Just lay some Befuddlement on them long enough for you to 
cut and run — or turn the tables and take them out first.

•  Tempestos: Surrounded by some pissed-off wraiths (like there’s any other kind)? Fire up Storm Squall 
— nothing like seeing the looks on their faces when a tsunami bursts through the ground to whisk you 
away as fast as a speeding car.

SPECTRES

347

However, this rigid system is fracturing with the emergence 
of two new groups: Striplings and Mortwights. Neither is yet 
considered a full caste, but both are distinct enough in tem-
perament and origin that their mere presence puts strain on 
the ages-old social order. For the moment, Striplings are simply 
categorized by which existing caste seems to suit them best, 
while Mortwights are provisionally inferior to Doppelgangers. 
Still, this may well change, should leaders step up from among 
their ranks to demand official status.

Spectre Characteristics

Regardless of caste, all Spectres have the same characteristics 

as wraiths (p. 111), with the following distinctions.
Angst and Pathos

As Spectres are dark reflections of wraiths, for any power 
that  costs  Pathos  for  wraiths  to  use,  assume  that  Spectres 
must spend Angst instead. Likewise, when a power or a botch 
might give one or more Angst points to the wraith’s Shadow, 
it instead bestows the listed amount as Pathos points to the 
Spectre’s Psyche.
Brief Life

Wracked with pain due to Oblivion’s constant gnawing 
hunger, a Spectre’s Corpus deteriorates rapidly. Few Spectres 
last more than a decade in the face of this ceaseless agony, as 
only succumbing to the Void ends the misery.

System:  Oblivion’s  influence  is  represented  in  botches. 
Each time you botch when playing a Spectre, lose 1 Corpus level 
permanently as Oblivion claims yet another portion of your soul.
Deathsight

Like wraiths, Spectres perceive the world as tainted and de-
cayed. In fact, thanks to the greater influence of Oblivion upon 
them, the Shadow-Eaten see only the worst, most putrefied aspects 
of things. This can even be used as a kind of “spirit radar” to sense 
the presence of targets that may be otherwise hidden from sight.
•  For Discern Weakness and Sense Health rolls, reduce the 

• 

difficulty by 1 (to a minimum of difficulty 2).
If you wish to make an instant assessment at –2 difficulty with 
any Deathsight power, your Psyche gains 1 Pathos point.

Dimmed Senses

Due to the dominance that Oblivion exerts over Spectres, 
their senses are dull compared to those of wraiths — sounds 
are muffled, touch is numbed, and sight is dimmed. This also 
makes  it  harder  to  penetrate  the  Shroud.  The  Shadowlands 
appear empty of mortals, and events in the Skinlands are hard 
to perceive.
•  All  Perception-based  rolls  are  subject  to  +1  difficulty, 
except those made using Deathsight or Lifesight powers 
or the Contaminate Dark Arcanos.

Psyche

348

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

• 

Interaction attempts with the mortal world that require 
Mental Traits are made at +2 difficulty.

•  Attempts to penetrate the Shroud are subject to +1 difficulty.
•  Spectres do not have access to Sharpened Senses powers.
Lifesight

For Spectres, it is not the vibrancy of the living world that 
draws them, but the black light of Oblivion. This embrace of the 
Void distances them from the living. The Shadow-Eaten move 
through a barren wasteland with only the faintest hints of the 
mortal world. While Spectres can employ Lifesight powers, it is 
harder for them to perceive the living. Events in the Skinlands 
are difficult to see, and the Shadowlands seem empty of mortals.
Additionally, a Spectre’s focus is always on the negative, 
with  the  goal  of  twisting  the  information  gleaned  to  their 
own dark ends. This is managed largely through roleplay and 
description, but can be essential to convey the warped outlook 
that Spectres have.

Rolls relating to Lifesight powers used on the living are 
at +2 difficulty. The Storyteller may choose to reduce this for 
Passion Sense attempts relating to emotions that correspond 
to the Spectre’s own Dark Passions.
Hive-Mind

As they serve Oblivion’s wishes before their own, Spectres 
are often linked telepathically. This allows them to communicate 
in the turbulent Tempest and to access information from the 
shared Spectral consciousness. Doing so is easiest in the Tem-
pest, since it is saturated with the memories and experiences 
of beings who have succumbed to Oblivion.
•  All Spectres have at least Collogue 1, though many have 

additional dots in this Dark Arcanos.

•  For Collogue rolls performed while in the Tempest, reduce 

the difficulty by 1 (to a minimum of difficulty 2).

Tempest Affinity

Spectres are born from Oblivion, like the Tempest itself. 
As a result, existing in the howling tumult of the Tempest or a 
Maelstrom is second nature to all Shadow-Eaten.
•  While in the Tempest or a Maelstrom, ignore any increased 
difficulties to Mental Traits due to environmental condi-
tions (Maneuver Complications, p. 336).

•  Spectres suffer no harm from being caught in a Maelstrom 
(p. 286). Objects tossed about by the savage winds may 
still cause injury.

Just as a wraith is tortured by her Shadow, so too is a Spectre 
tormented by his Psyche. The Psyche is all that remains of a 
Spectre’s higher self. Its ultimate goal is to guide the Spectre 
away from Oblivion and toward Redemption. See p. 382 for 
more information.

Rapacity

It  has  been  said  that  Spectres  are  souls  that  the 
scouring winds of the Tempest have ground down to raw 
emotion. This erosion is most often expressed through 
Rapacity: an overpowering need to free the Oblivion 
contained  within  a  creature  —  either  by  tearing  the 
creature apart physically or by consuming their spirit.

Roll Willpower (difficulty 7) when encountering 
a  creature  with  a  Passion  or  Dark  Passion  similar  to 
your highest-rated Dark Passion. If successful, you hold 
Oblivion at bay for the remainder of the scene. On a 
failed roll, you become rapacious and attack the creature 
with the intent to destroy it. If you attack physically, 
you do not think tactically, and use only straightforward 
physical attacks or Arcanoi that inflict direct damage.

You  may  instead  attack  a  target’s  spirit.  This  is 
handled as a resisted action against the opponent’s Will-
power. Each extra success you roll reduces the target’s 
permanent Willpower score by 1; this is converted to 1 
Willpower point that you add to your pool. Alternately, 
you may increase your own Willpower score by 1 for every 
2 permanent Willpower that the target loses. Most mortals 
have low Willpower scores, so they can literally die of 
fright if a Rapacity attack reduces them to Willpower 0.
While in the grip of Rapacity, you may make a new 
roll each turn to recover (assuming neither you nor the 
target is destroyed first). You may spend 1 Willpower point 
instead to stave off Rapacity for the scene, although the 
Storyteller may require additional Willpower expenditure 
under certain especially intense circumstances.

Dark Arcanoi and Shadecraft

hese powers are unique to Spectres, 
as they alone channel the might of 
Oblivion.  Only  at  the  Storyteller’s 
discretion  and  under  exceptional 
circumstances might a wraith learn 
a Dark Arcanos.

Dark Arcanoi rolls are made ver-
sus difficulty 6, unless stated otherwise in the description.

Collogue

Known historically to some as “Hive Mind,” Col-
logue  does  tap  into  the  mass  mind  that  connects  all 
Spectres. However, a separate designation was created 
since this Dark Arcanos explores directed applications 
of power that not all Spectres learn. At its most basic 
level, Collogue is the means by which all Spectres com-
municate within the hive mind gestalt. Still, those who 
delve deeper into its potential can tap into memories from 
times long past and even direct others to do their bidding.

SPECTRES

349

• Shared Whispers

The Spectre conducts a two-way telepathic conversation 
with any Spectre he knows, regardless of the distance separat-
ing them.

System: Roll Perception + Collogue. You and the target 
can carry on a conversation for a number of turns equal to the 
number of successes rolled. If you also have Swarm Network 
active,  you  can  use  Shared  Whispers  to  communicate  with 
everyone in your group. They can only “speak” directly with 
you, however, so you must relay — or rephrase — any messages 
they want to share.

On a botch, you all lose contact with the Spectral mass 

mind for a number of turns equal to the botches rolled.
•• Swarm Network

The Spectre shares up to the full range of his senses with 

other members of his pack.

System: Spend 1 Angst, then roll Perception + Collogue; 
the successes rolled indicate the number of your senses that 
you may choose to share. You determine which senses to share 
and need not allocate the full range. Likewise, this is not an 
intrusive act — recipients can accept or decline the sensory 
input as they wish. You may network a number of other char-
acters equal to your Willpower rating, and the effect lasts for 
the remainder of the scene.

On a botch, you short out the entire group’s Spectral mass 

mind for a number of turns equal to the botches rolled.
••• Racial Memory

The Spectre plumbs the depths of the hive mind to glean 
thoughts and memories, even from those that the Void claimed 

SPECTRES AND BOTCHING

Botches  fit  very  well  thematically  with 
Spectres. As such, rules for botches are included 
throughout  this  chapter,  with  the  understand-
ing  that  it’s  every  troupe’s  call  whether  or  not 
to use them.

A Spectre suffers the constant gnawing, tear-
ing hunger of Oblivion upon his very Corpus. As 
noted under “Brief Life” (p. 348), you lose 1 Corpus 
health level permanently each time you botch.

A botch may inflict additional negative ef-
fects as well. The Storyteller may declare that any 
botch effects listed with dramatic systems, Dark 
Arcanoi, Shadecraft, and the like are in addition 
to the Corpus loss.

A  Spectre’s  existence  is  not  particularly 

long ago. With this art, the Spectre can access details on matters 
with which he is vaguely familiar, or even find the answers to 
riddles, the locations of long-lost hoards, and other details that 
he could never know otherwise.

Systems: Spend 1 Angst, then roll Intelligence + Collogue. 
Each success indicates a piece of information that you “remember” 
on the desired subject. You may access this knowledge in detail for 
the remainder of the scene; after the effect ends, only a general 
recollection remains. This art applies solely to discrete informa-
tion, and you cannot use it to access Arcanoi or other powers.

On a botch, your connection to the hive mind drops for 

the rest of the scene.
•••• Spectral Command

The Spectre compels another Spectre to follow a single 
command. This art is useful for getting one’s point across in the 
moment without argument, but can cause escalating friction if 
used indiscriminately.

Systems: Spend 2 Angst, then roll Manipulation + Col-
logue in a resisted action against the target’s Wits + Collogue 
or Willpower (whichever is greater). The target must follow 
the spirit as well as the letter of the command for a number of 
scenes  equal  to  the  extra  successes  you  roll.  A  target  under 
the influence of Spectral Command may spend 1 Willpower 
to avoid performing an action that is directly self-destructive.
On a botch, your connection to the target through the 
hive mind suffers a short, making you unable to ever attempt 
Spectral Command on that individual ever again.
••••• Manifest Arcanoi

The Spectre establishes such a deep connection with the 
Spectral mass consciousness that he may tap into the ability 
to wield any Arcanoi and Dark Arcanoi.

System: Spend 2 Angst and 1 Willpower, then roll Percep-
tion + Collogue (difficulty 7). You may “learn” only one Arcanos 
or Dark Arcanos with each attempt, declared when you roll. 
On a successful roll, you access that Arcanos’ 1-dot powers for 
the remainder of the scene, and may “learn” 1 additional dot 
for every two extra successes beyond this.

On a botch, you forget your own Arcanoi and Dark Arcanoi 

for the remainder of the scene.

Each time you use this art, your Psyche gains 1 Pathos point.

Contaminate

Similar  to  Castigate,  this  Dark  Arcanos  allows  you  to 
commune with a wraith’s Shadow, though the similarity ends 
there. Admired by Spectres and feared by wraiths, masters of 
this art cultivate the seed of darkness that is the Shadow, with 
the ultimate goal of overwhelming the target from within.
• Sense Nature

The Spectre can discover a wraith’s Nature by peering in 

the dark reflection cast in her Shadow.

pleasant.

350

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

System: Spend 1 Angst and roll Intelligence + Contami-
nate. If successful, you learn the wraith’s Nature. The target’s 
Shadow does not assist with this process.
•• Shadowspeech

The  Spectre  converses  directly  with  a  wraith’s  Shadow. 
This is a telepathic connection, although the Spectre may speak 
aloud for dramatic effect. The Shadow may choose to respond 
verbally also by using the wraith’s own voice — assuming the 
wraith doesn’t try to resist the effort.

System: Spend 1 Angst and roll Manipulation + Contami-
nate in a resisted action against the target’s Manipulation + 
Castigate. For each extra success you roll, you may make a single 
statement to or ask one question of the Shadow, and receive 
a corresponding reply. If conversing verbally, the wraith being 
targeted may make a successful Willpower roll (difficulty 8) to 
keep her Shadow from speaking through her mouth.
••• Transfer Angst

The Spectre channels his own Angst to empower a wraith’s 
Shadow. The targeted wraith must be in direct line of sight, 
but is unaware that anything is happening unless the Spectre 
draws attention in some fashion.

System: Spend 1 Angst and roll Stamina + Contaminate. 
If successful, you may transfer an amount of Angst points up 
to the number of extra successes rolled. The points transferred 
are added to the Shadow’s Angst pool. Further, your Psyche 
also receives 1 Pathos point for each Angst point you transfer.
On a botch, the targeted wraith is instantly aware of both 

your presence and your failed attempt.
•••• Awaken Thorns

You encourage new Thorns to grow in the ashen soil of the 

Shadow with which to bedevil the targeted wraith.

System: Spend 2 Angst and roll Charisma + Contaminate 
in a resisted action against the target’s Wits + Castigate. For 
each  extra  success  you  roll,  the  target  Shadow  permanently 
manifests  a  new,  previously  latent,  Thorn.  A  Shadow  has  a 
number of latent Thorns equal to its Angst rating minus its 
current number of active Thorns. On a botch, the Shadow loses 
one already-manifested Thorn.
••••• Call the Shadow

The Spectre drags forth the targeted wraith’s Shadow to 
take control, even if the Shadow’s current Angst-point total 
does not exceed the wraith’s Willpower rating.

System: Spend 2 Angst and 1 Willpower, then roll Strength 
+ Contaminate (difficulty 8, or the wraith’s Willpower, which-
ever is higher). If successful, you call forth the targeted Shadow, 
which may make a Catharsis attempt on the next turn (p. 236).
On a botch, you and the Shadow each lose 1 Angst point, 
and the Shadow is stunned into silence for the remainder of 
the scene.

Corruption

This Dark Arcanos is in some ways similar to Puppetry. 
However, with Corruption, you manipulate the target’s mind 
and spirit so that she becomes a willing host.

Corruption arts only work on those of the living who are 
already stained with Oblivion. The target must be similar in 
temperament to you already, be a disturbed personality, or have 
a weak sense of self. Of course, Maleficence can be used to help 
lay the groundwork….

You must possess a target by rolling Manipulation + Cor-
ruption, difficulty 6, before you can employ Corruption upon 
her. Further, some powers require that the target first be attuned 
as a Consort (p. 149).
• Lurid Visions

This most simple of Corruption arts does not involve direct 
control over a target. Instead, it implants a brief vision — a 
flash of inspiration or simple imagery. Complex ideas and mes-
sages are beyond the scope of this art; at best, a Spectre may 
urge the target to make a left turn or “remember” to pick up a 
bottle of liquor.

System: While possessing the target, spend 1 Angst, then 
roll Charisma + Corruption (difficulty is the local Shroud rat-
ing). The successes rolled indicate the degree of detail possible 
with the vision — 1 success might flash a generic image, while 
5 successes can display a specific, detailed subject.
•• Idle Hands

The  Spectre  directs  the  subject’s  body  to  undertake  a 

particular task while her mind is distracted.

This art cannot be used to force a possessed target to perform 

a lethal or self-destructive action.

System: While possessing the target, spend 1 Angst and roll 
Dexterity + Corruption in a resisted action against the target’s 
Willpower. The Storyteller may allow you additional dice de-
pending on how relevant the proposed action is to the subject’s 
current state of mind — for instance, you may get three additional 
dice if you want the subject to write “The bastard must die” 100 
times while she’s stewing over her hated ex-lover, but no benefit 
if you want the subject to build a pipe bomb while she’s thinking 
about how much fun she’ll have playing with her new puppy.

While a subject may not resist this effect by spending Will-
power, repeated use of Idle Hands on an unwilling victim makes 
it increasingly unlikely that her attention will continue to drift.
On a botch, the target is disturbed at the thought of the 
action she almost performed, granting one additional die to her 
Willpower roll for any future Corruption attempts.
••• Mass Hallucination

The Spectre uses the possessed subject as a kind of spiritual 
antenna to broadcast a hallucination in the immediate area. 

SPECTRES

351

This can be used as a distraction, a scattershot attempt to soak 
up some Angst, or simply for amusement.

System: While possessing the subject, spend 1 Angst and 
roll Dexterity + Corruption (difficulty is the local Shroud rat-
ing). The hallucination lasts but an instant, while the number 
of successes determines its intensity. With 1 success, you cre-
ate a momentary distraction, a flicker out of the corner of the 
eye, while with 5 successes, you manifest a brief, yet intense, 
full-sensory event. At the Storyteller’s discretion, 3 or more 
successes may trigger an emotional response strong enough to 
fulfill one of your Dark Passions.

On a botch, you’re overwhelmed by psychic feedback; you 
lose 1 Angst and are unable use this power for the remainder 
of the scene.
•••• Urges

Employing  this  art  overcomes  the  target’s  Willpower  to 
undertake a single action of the Spectre’s choice. The action 
must  fulfill  one  of  the  Spectre’s  Dark  Passions,  and  must  be 
something that the target is willing to do on at least some level.
System: While possessing the target, spend 2 Angst and 1 
Willpower, then roll Manipulation + Corruption in a resisted 
action against the target’s Willpower. If successful, the target 
attempts the action you desire. If she succeeds, you gain Angst 
as appropriate for triggering a Dark Passion. The target may 
spend 1 Willpower to resist performing the action.

On a botch, the target feels revulsion at the thought of the 
action she almost performed, granting one additional die to her 
Willpower roll for any future Corruption attempts.
••••• Blissful Unity

The Spectre makes a special place for himself in the target’s 
soul. In fact, the subject’s soul and body survive the invasion. 
The target is actually aware of the Spectre’s presence and remains 
conscious and in control of his body; he simply follows the Spec-
tre’s orders with no hesitation. In effect, whenever the Spectre is 
“in residence,” he replaces the subject’s free will.

System: After attuning a Consort through multiple uses 
of Corruption (at least 10 times), spend 5 Angst and subtract 1 
from your permanent Willpower rating, then roll Manipulation 
+ Corruption in a resisted action against the target’s Willpower + 
3 (maximum 9). There are no modifications for Consort status. 
The extra successes rolled indicate the strength of the corrupt-
ing influence — for permanent unity, you must accumulate a 
number of successes equal to the target’s Willpower score.

If you do not achieve permanent unity with the initial roll, 
you may take an extended action each subsequent turn by spending 
an additional 2 Angst points and 1 Willpower point, then rolling 
Manipulation + Corruption in a resisted action against the target’s 
Willpower until you accumulate the required extra successes.

The victim is aware that this process is happening (hence 
the  resisted  action).  However,  once  you  achieve  permanent 
unity, any resistance vanishes. The target continues to live his 

life as normal, but he now accepts your dominance without 
reservation. When you possess him, he follows any commands 
promptly and to the best of his ability.

The target counts as a 1-point Fetter, and to “get behind 
the wheel” you may now simply spend 1 Angst point. A mortal 
subjected  to  this  power  almost  always  falls  to  Oblivion  im-
mediately after death, though some may become Mortwights.
A botch at any part of this process indicates spiritual in-
compatibility, rendering you unable to ever use Blissful Unity 
on the target.

Each time you use this art, your Psyche gains 1 Pathos point.

Larceny

The  arts  of  this  Dark  Arcanos  stave  off  the  inevitable 
approach of the Void by stealing from the physical forms and 
minds of others to restore your Corpus and Angst. It attracts 
condemnation from many Onceborn and their priests, for each 
use strengthens every Spectre’s worst enemy: the Psyche. Some 
feel the Malfeans are also against the use of Larceny because it 
conveys a greater understanding of the nature of Oblivion and 
how to manipulate it — an understanding the Malfeans prefer 
to keep to themselves.
• Steal Corpus

With a simple touch, the Spectre may steal Corpus from 
another Spectre or a wraith, and transfer it to himself or another. 
The theft is impossible to miss, manifesting as a sludgy fluid 
pulsing with the black light of Oblivion.

System: Spend 1 Angst and roll Manipulation + Larceny 
in a resisted action against the target’s Stamina + Larceny or 
Willpower (whichever is greater). For every 2 extra successes 
rolled,  you  drain  1  aggravated  Corpus  level  from  the  target. 
You may ingest this fluid Corpus yourself or pass it to someone 
else; a Spectre or wraith who consumes it gains that amount 
of Corpus, up to the character’s maximum. If not ingested by 
the end of the scene, the Corpus fluid dissipates.

This art does not restore permanent Corpus lost due to 

Oblivion (see “Brief Life,” p. 348).

You must be in direct contact to use this power. At the 
Storyteller’s discretion, a clinch maneuver may be required first 
if the target is wary of you or actively resisting contact.

On a botch, you fail to transfer any Corpus; instead, you 

suffer 1 lethal Corpus level of damage.

This cannot be soaked or otherwise avoided.

•• Emotional Infection

The Spectre implants a Dark Passion in a target, whether 
mortal or supernatural, or increases the strength of an existing 
Dark Passion. This is a common means of preying upon mortals, 
by staining them with Oblivion over time.

System: Spend 1 Angst and roll Manipulation + Larceny 
in a resisted action against the difficulty of the local Shroud 
or  the  target’s  Willpower  (whichever  is  greater).  This  is  an 

352

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

extended action; implant-
ing  a  new  Dark  Passion 
requires a total of 3 extra 
successes, while increas-
ing the strength of an existing 
Dark Passion by 1 dot requires a total 
number of extra successes equal to 
the current rating.

The  infection  —  whether 
new Dark Passion or increased rat-
ing — dissipates at the end of the 
scene  unless  the  target  exercises 
her  Dark  Passion  and  gains  Angst 
from it. If the target does so for three 
scenes in a row, the infection becomes 

permanent.

The target must be in direct line of 
sight, and a wave of pulsing black light 
radiates  from  you  to  the  target  for  the 
duration  of  the  extended  action.  You 
cannot  use  this  power  to  increase  your 
own Dark Passions.

On a botch, you cannot make an Emo-
tional Infection attempt on any targets 
for the remainder of the scene.
••• Savor Agony

The Spectre gains Angst from the agony 
of an injury inflicted upon a mortal or su-
pernatural target. The energy is drawn out 
in a thick, smoky vapor that the Spectre 
inhales.

System: Immediately after a nearby 
target  takes  aggravated  damage,  roll 
Strength + Larceny in a resisted action against 
the  target’s  Willpower.  You  gain  a  number  of 
Angst points equal to the extra successes you roll, 
up to the amount of aggravated damage the victim 

suffered.

SPECTRES

353

You  must  be  in  close  combat  with  the  target  (p.  331), 

although anyone can inflict the aggravated damage.

On a botch, you suffer a kind of psychic whiplash and lose 

1 Angst point.
•••• Withstand Oblivion

The Spectre can draw upon the pain of others to recover 
part  of  his  essence  lost  through  direct  damage  by  Oblivion 
(which cannot be restored any other way). While this art can 
keep Oblivion at bay, it can also threaten the Spectre in another 
way by strengthening his Psyche.

System: Immediately after a nearby target takes aggravated 
damage, spend 2 Angst and roll Stamina + Larceny (difficulty 
8). Each success rolled allows you to restore 1 point of any Trait 
lost to Oblivion. This is most often used to restore Corpus levels 
lost through botches (see “Brief Life,” p. 348), but may also apply 
to an Attribute or other Trait reduced due to Oblivion-related 
circumstances. You cannot restore a Trait beyond its original 
level. Furthermore, your Psyche gains 1 Pathos point for each 
point that you restore.

You  must  be  within  arm’s  reach  of  the  target,  although 

anyone can inflict the aggravated damage.

On a botch, Oblivion lashes out to inflict 1 aggravated 

Corpus level of damage upon you.
••••• Defy Oblivion

The Spectre preserves himself by shifting the burden of 
Oblivion to other beings. While this is an effective way to avoid 
destruction, it is a damning betrayal of one’s own nature as a 
servant of Oblivion. Even so, some claim that it is through this 
art that the Malfeans have sustained themselves for millennia.
System: Immediately following any activity requiring loss 
of Corpus, spend 2 Angst and 2 Willpower, then roll Charisma + 
Larceny (difficulty 7). If successful, you lose no Corpus; instead, 
you eject the gnawing force of Oblivion in the form of a mass 
of caustic parasites equal to the number of successes rolled.

Each one of these parasites attacks a target in the area, 
as determined by the Storyteller. Make a resisted Willpower 
roll against each target. If you get more successes, the parasite 
inflicts 1 aggravated Corpus level of damage (or 1 aggravated 
health level, if the target is mortal) as it burrows into the target.
On  a  botch,  Oblivion  rips  through  you  for  double  the 
amount of permanent Corpus loss that would have occurred 
originally. You cannot try another Defy Oblivion attempt to 
counteract this. 

Regardless  of  this  art’s  final  result,  your  Psyche  gains  2 
Pathos points for each aggravated Corpus level of damage that 
the parasites inflict.

Maleficence

Maleficence grants the ability to invest beings with the power 
of Oblivion. It is used most often in developing mortal Oblivion 
cults, and to send captured wraiths down the path to becoming 

Spectres. Users of this Dark Arcanos are often the Labyrinth’s 
equivalent of evangelists. These missionaries spread the ideol-
ogy of entropy in the Shadowlands and Skinlands alike. While 
openly proselytizing Spectres wouldn’t last an hour in Stygia, 
fringe communities of Renegades and Heretics are less judgmental.
Remember that Spectres are subject to +1 difficulty when 

using powers across the Shroud.
• Black Whispers

The Spectre can communicate directly with the mind of 
a mortal. This art has a variety of uses, from driving deranged 
mortals over the brink to delivering faux-infernal proclama-
tions to cult leaders.

System: Spend 1 Angst and roll Charisma + Maleficence 
(difficulty is the local Shroud rating or the target’s Willpower, 
whichever is higher). The successes rolled represent the number 
of turns you may communicate telepathically with the mortal. On 
a botch, the target learns to ignore your mental whispers, apply-
ing a +1 difficulty to all future Black Whisper attempts on her.
•• Investiture

The Spectre invests a mortal with Angst, with the goal of 
later granting her Spectral powers (as covered with Empower-
ment, below). Mortals have a limited tolerance for such potent 
emotions and can become unstable if they receive too much.

System: Spend 1 Angst to trigger this art, along with as 
many points of Angst as you want to grant to the subject, then 
roll  Strength  +  Maleficence  (difficulty  is  the  local  Shroud 
rating). If successful, you invest the desired amount of Angst 
points, up to the number of successes rolled.

When you use Dark Arcanoi subsequently on a target who 

is invested with Angst, reduce the difficulty of any rolls by 2.

If the number of Angst points invested exceeds the mortal’s 
Willpower rating, she is driven temporarily insane — anything 
from a psychotic break to catatonia, as dictated by the Storyteller. 
On a botch, you snap the mortal’s mind permanently, leaving 
behind a gibbering wreck.
••• Discipline

The Spectre makes his displeasure known upon the mind 
and body of a mortal in whom he has invested Angst. This 
art  is  used  to  remind  errant  minions  who  is  truly  in  charge, 
though sometimes it’s employed simply for kicks or to fulfill 
Dark Passions.

System: Spend a number of Angst points equal to the degree 
of effect you wish to impose, then roll Dexterity + Maleficence 
in a resisted action against the target’s Stamina. For each point 
of Angst you spend, all of the mortal’s actions are reduced by 
one die as she suffers constant and severe pain — migraines, 
muscle spasms, or even bleeding from the eyes — for a number 
of scenes equal to the extra successes you roll.

On  a  botch,  you  go  too  far  and  trigger  an  aneurism  or 

similarly deadly result.

354

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

•••• Empower

By grating away at a mortal’s very soul with the power of 
the Void, the Spectre grants her supernatural abilities. These 
powers  are  a  direct  manifestation  of  the  stain  of  Oblivion, 
resulting in the subject’s noticeable physical and mental decay.
System: Spend 1 Angst and 1 Willpower to trigger this 
art, plus 5 additional Angst points for each dot of the Dark 
Arcanos power you wish to bestow; then roll Manipulation + 
Maleficence (difficulty is the local Shroud rating, reduced by 
2 if the target is invested with Angst already). You must roll a 
number of successes at least equal to the rating of the power to 
bestow it successfully.

You may only Empower the target with a Dark Arcanos 
power that you possess. The art is permanent once bestowed, 
and functions exactly the same as for a Spectre, including any 
required  Angst  and  Willpower  costs  and  any  rolls  required. 
Note that mortals cannot generate their own Angst, and must 
rely on Investiture from Spectres.

On a botch, you accidentally wipe clean the subject’s current 
Angst pool and may never try another Empower attempt on her.
••••• Conversion

This art reveals to a captive wraith or Spectre audience 
the true power and depth of Oblivion, from which there is no 
escape save the Void. Conversion may be used to strip audience 
members of their Willpower or bolster their Angst.

System: When using the power, first determine whether you 
wish to decrease the target’s Willpower rating or increase their 
maximum Angst pool. Next, spend 2 Angst and 2 Willpower 
and roll Charisma + Maleficence in a resisted action against 
the  target’s  Stamina  +  Occult  or  Willpower  (whichever  the 
target chooses).

Conversion is an extended action that works only on a 
captive audience of wraiths or Spectres. It requires a number 
of successes equal to 3 times the combined total of the Trait 
being targeted. So, converting a group of eight wraiths with a 
combined Willpower score of 48 requires 144 total successes, 
while a group of four Spectres with a combined Angst pool of 
26 requires 78 total successes. Once the required successes are 
collected,  each  member  of  the  audience  has  her  Willpower 
rating  reduced  by  1,  or  her  maximum  Angst  pool  capacity 
increased  by  1  (as  appropriate  to  your  stated  goal  with  the 
power) permanently.

As  attempting  Conversion  is  quite  draining  and  time 
consuming, Spectres often employ teamwork (p. 101). Assume 
that it takes roughly one hour for every 5 total successes needed.
On  a  botch,  your  Angst  pool  capacity  is  reduced  by  1 

permanently, and all successes gained to that point are lost.

Shroud Rending

Normally, the Shadowlands appear empty to Spectres save 
for  residents  of  the  Underworld.  You  may  employ  this  Dark 

Arcanos to peer through the Shroud and even manipulate it 
to impact the Skinlands. Mortals remain unaware of your pres-
ence — though the effects of certain Shroud Rending arts may 
be impossible to ignore.

Unless stated otherwise, the difficulty for all Shroud Rend-
ing powers is equal to the local Shroud rating; see “The Shroud” 
(p. 382) for more information. Also, remember that a Spectre’s 
attempts to penetrate the Shroud are subject to +1 difficulty.

Often, botching a Shroud Rending attempt drags you into 

the Tempest from backlash.
• Virtuality

Skinlands for a brief period.

The  Spectre  employs  this  art  to  perceive  events  in  the 

System: Spend 1 Angst, then roll Perception + Shroud 
Rending (difficulty is the local Shroud rating). The number 
of successes rolled indicates the strength of your connection 
across the Shroud: 1 success results in weak audio or visuals with 
bursts of supernatural interference, while 5 successes means a 
clear connection — as clear as the barrier between worlds al-
lows — that captures every nuance of unfolding events. Since 
Shroud Rending impacts your senses only, the effect moves with 
you while the power is active. This lasts for the duration of the 
scene, although you may cancel it at any time.

On a botch, backlash from the Shroud overwhelms your 
senses, increasing the difficulty by 1 of all Perception-related 
rolls for the remainder of the scene.
•• Lurking Presence

The Spectre tears the fabric of the Shroud, leaving transpar-

ent tatters through which the living can perceive him.

System: Spend 1 Angst, then roll Manipulation + Shroud 
Rending (difficulty is the local Shroud rating); each success rolled 
equals the number of turns that you manifest to the perceptions 
of those in the Skinlands. While this art is in effect, subjects 
who view you are not affected by the Fog, as appropriate to their 
Willpower ratings (see “Fog Ratings,” p. 285).

This art merely reveals your presence; the Shroud is not 
actually rent asunder, nor can you cross into the Skinlands. The 
gouge you carve in the Shroud is not unlike a window — you 
face a single direction, and mortals must be directly opposite 
to see you. Repeated use of Lurking Presence can lower the 
local Shroud rating permanently, at the Storyteller’s discretion.
••• Nightmare

With a tearing of the Shroud, the Spectre allows the stain 
of Oblivion to seep into a sleeping mortal. While vaguely similar 
to Phantasm, the Spectre has no control over or knowledge of 
the nightmares he unleashes. Rather, he simply connects the 
sleeping victim’s psyche directly to the terrible chaos of the 
Tempest itself.

System:  Spend  2  Angst,  then  roll  Dexterity  +  Shroud 
Rending (difficulty is the local Shroud rating); a successful roll 

SPECTRES

355

plunges the mortal into terrible nightmares. On a successful roll, 
the subject’s actions are reduced by one die on the following 
day until he gets sound, uninterrupted sleep. You may also apply 
an additional one-die reduction for every 2 extra successes on 
the roll. This art can only be used on a particular subject once 
each time he sleeps, but the effect is cumulative if applied on 
successive nights.

If the penalty equals the subject’s highest Attribute + Ability 
combination, he experiences a nervous breakdown and requires 
medical assistance or even temporary institutionalization. A 
wraith may try to combat this art by using Dreamweaver (p. 
210) during the subject’s nightmare.

Each time you use this art, your Psyche gains 1 Pathos point.

•••• Shroud Revenant

The Spectre uses the Shroud as a conduit to tap into the 
soul residue that lingers in a recently dead body, commanding 
the corpse to lurch into a zombie-like state for a short time.

System: Spend 2 Angst and 1 Willpower, then roll Ma-
nipulation + Shroud Rending (difficulty is the local Shroud 
rating). The corpse is animated for a number of turns equal 
to the successes rolled, unless it takes sufficient damage to be 
destroyed (assume it has 5 health levels). Even if the corpse 
is hacked apart, the limbs continue to move until destroyed 
(assume each limb has 1 health level)

The shroud revenant is literally a shambling corpse, with 
average physical traits, no powers, and only the barest of percep-
tion (for simplicity, use the Traits for a standard mortal). There 
is just enough soul residue to issue a single command, and the 
corpse can perform only the simplest tasks — attack someone, 
hold a door closed, walk in a circle, and so forth. Once you have 
given the command no further instructions may be given, and 
the revenant may not leave the area.

The corpse must be fresh for this power to work, at most 

a number of days dead equal to Stamina + Shroud Rending.

Each time you use this art, your Psyche gains 1 Pathos point.

••••• Transparent Memories

You can weave the Shroud itself to pierce a living subject’s 

mind to tap into his thoughts.

System: Spend 2 Angst and 1 Willpower, then roll Percep-
tion + Shroud Rending (difficulty is the local Shroud rating 
or the target’s Willpower, whichever is higher). You can read 
the target’s thoughts for a number of turns equal to the suc-
cesses rolled.

As a person’s thoughts are seldom clear and regimented, 
the Storyteller should describe what you perceive in a series 
of  unstructured  impressions,  snatches  of  phrases,  or  memory 
fragments. You may try Investigate (p. 323) or similar efforts 
to parse what’s useful from the mental ebb and flow. If the sub-
ject’s feeling strong emotions, the Storyteller may require you 
to make a Rapacity check (p. 349) — though at +2 difficulty, 
since you’re tapped directly into the target’s consciousness.

Tempestos

Spectres  use  this  Dark  Arcanos  to  ride  and  manipulate 
Maelstrom winds. Distinct from Tempest Weaving in that it 
focuses upon travel, Tempestos grew to prominence with the 
rise of the Third Maelstrom. Practitioners of this art are the 
shock troops of Oblivion, swooping in on the leading edge of 
a storm to strike at their foes.
• Storm Seeker

The Spectre sets himself adrift in the Tempest to be drawn 
toward a storm front by tapping into his affinity with the soul 
storms of the Underworld.

System:  On  a  successful  Intelligence  +  Tempestos  roll, 
you  navigate  the  Tempest’s  ebb  and  flow  to  find  a  brewing 
storm front. This can take hours or even days, depending on 
local conditions in the Tempest; the Storyteller may choose to 
reduce the time depending on the number of successes rolled. 
You have no control over the size of the storm discovered, nor 
its heading.
•• Storm Surfing

The Spectre cuts a path through a Maelstrom by surfing 
upon its turbulent winds. This is notably different from Tempest 
Riding (p. 358), in that the Spectre can steer himself actively 
amid the storm to chart his own course.

System: Spend 1 Angst point and roll Dexterity + Tempestos. 
On a successful roll, you can fly at up to the speed of the Mael-
strom winds as long as you move in the same general direction of 
the storm. Further, you may add any extra successes beyond the 
first to your dice pool for any maneuver rolls you attempt, up to 
a limit of the Maelstrom’s rating x 2. You must remain moving 
at all times, but you have precise control over your speed and 
trajectory — slowing to a virtual hover or making hairpin turns.
If  you  use  Storm  Surfing  while  piloting  a  relic  vehicle, 
you are limited to the vehicle’s maneuver rating for any special 
maneuver attempts (Relic Vehicle table, p. 319).

Storm Surfing remains active for the scene; however, you 
must activate it again if you leave the Maelstrom at any point.
••• Storm Squall

The Spectre can call up a minor storm from the Tempest to 
use as transportation. The squall might even rip open a Nihil along 
the way, depending on where the Spectre is located at the time.
System:  Spend  1  Angst  and  roll  Manipulation  +  Tem-
pestos. You may carry a number of other characters or objects 
along with you equal to the number of successes rolled. You do 
not have to maintain physical contact; they’re swept along by 
the same winds that you ride. Any other characters who try to 
hitch a ride suffer a +2 difficulty to any maneuvers, since the 
squall is so small and focused.

You  travel  at  the  speed  of  the  storm  winds  (up  to  75 
mph/120  km/h)  and  may  use  Stamina  +  Drive  or  Argos  for 

356

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

basic maneuverability, but Storm Surfing is required for fine 
control. The squall is considered a level 1 Maelstrom and lasts 
for one scene before dissipating, though it may rage on longer 
at the Storyteller’s discretion.
•••• Tempest Fury

The Spectre calls down the Tempest in a devastating at-
tack, blasting through a Nihil if need be. This art is often used 
for  breaching  gates  and  smashing  relic  vehicles,  though  it’s 
also handy for simply battering an individual wraith with the 
power of the storm.

System:  Spend 1 Angst and 1 Willpower, then make a 
standard Strength + Tempestos roll. This is considered an attack 
roll on a one-yard/meter-diameter area within your line of sight. 
The successes rolled are then applied as a damage dice pool as 
the focused Maelstrom blast hammers the target. Each success 
on the damage roll inflicts 1 lethal Corpus level of damage on 
anything within the targeted area.
••••• Maelstrom Cauldron

The  Spectre  summons  a  minor  Maelstrom  from  the 
very depths of the Labyrinth, bringing with it all manner of 
concomitant spectral debris. This art can take a lot out of the 
spectre — sometimes literally, as she must channel her very 
being into the summoning. Some Spectres have been torn to 
shreds in the process of calling forth a Maelstrom.

System: Spend 2 Angst and 1 Willpower, then roll Ma-
nipulation + Tempestos against a difficulty equal to the desired 
Maelstrom level + 5; the successes indicate the number of hours 
the Maelstrom rages. You also suffer 1 lethal level of Corpus 
damage for each success rolled. Once summoned, the Maelstrom 
is not subject to your control and rages like any other soul storm; 
refer to the section on Maelstroms for details (p. 286).

Tempest Weaving

With this Dark Arcanos, you manipulate the very substance 
of the Tempest itself. The Malfeans used it to carve much of the 
Labyrinth from primordial darkness when they first crawled from 
the Void. In current times, Mortwights are considered masters 
of the art. A Spectre versed in Tempest Weaving can traverse 
the farthest reaches of the Tempest in the blink of an eye and 
shape the raw stuff of the Tempest into active nightmare.
• Wormhole

The  Spectre  can  use  a  Nihil  as  a  shortcut  between  the 
Shadowlands and the Tempest. You simply stretch the Nihil 
open and clamber in, emerging moments later from the other 
end (wherever that may be).

System: On a successful Stamina + Tempest Weaving roll, 
you pass through the Nihil without mishap, arriving safely on the 
other side. Additional successes indicate that you may choose 

SPECTRES

357

to hold the Nihil open for others to use as well. Otherwise, the 
Nihil closes immediately once you pass through.
•• Tempest Riding

The  Spectre  can  travel  across  the  Underworld  by  glid-
ing  upon  the  soul  storms  that  rumble  up  from  the  Tempest 
and  through  the  Shadowlands.  While  you  have  no  control 
over  your  ultimate  destination,  you  can  nonetheless  cover 
phenomenal distances in a short time. Spectres use Tempest 
Riding to propel mass assaults on Shadowlands citadels, and 
even the smallest Maelstrom is liable to be rife with jeering, 
bloodthirsty Shadow-Eaten.

System: Spend 1 Angst point and roll Dexterity + Tempest 
Weaving. On a successful roll, you launch yourself correctly to 
catch a passing soul wind. Additional successes mean you’ve 
caught  an  especially  fast  storm  current.  You  must  spend  1 
additional  Angst  for  each  subsequent  hour  spent  traveling. 
The Storyteller determines where you travel and the distance 
covered, though you may leave the storm current at any time.
While  using  this  power,  you  may  carry  objects  or  even 
other passengers up to your carrying capacity (p. 316), though 
you must hold on to them for the duration of travel. Anything 
you lose hold of is whipped away randomly through the storm.
••• Tempest Grasp

The Spectre plunges a hand into the Tempest and pulls 
out the first thing that floats by. Flotsam found this way is not 
always useful, but is at least generally entertaining. Recovered 
items are either memories or minor relics (lingering memories 
from wraiths long since gone; the mask of a Skeletal Anacreon, 
lost in the 16th century; a mismatched pair of relic socks).

System: Spend 1 Angst point and roll Dexterity + Tempest 
Weaving.  If  successful,  you  pull  an  item  from  the  Tempest. 
Memories retrieved in this manner may hold 1 or 2 points of a 
Dark Passion, which you may devour to boost your Angst pool. 
Minor relics may be used to decorate the set of a Harrowing, 
or even as weapons if appropriate. Anything retrieved in this 
fashion crumbles to uselessness at the end of the scene unless 
sustained by another method.

Each time you use this art, your Psyche gains 1 Pathos point.

•••• Favored Flotsam

The Spectre pulls something directly relevant to the prob-
lem at hand from the Tempest. The flotsam found depends on 
the specific nature of what afflicts him — whether a physical 
object (a relic boat if lost in a soul storm, an Artifact weapon 
to fend off a Legionnaire patrol) or a memory (an opponent’s 
hidden  desire  that  can  be  of  aid  in  a  negotiation;  a  painful 
recollection that can be used as a distraction prior to attack or 
escape). Some Spectres also use this art to hide valued relics 
and rare artifacts, in order to retrieve them later at their leisure.
System: To retrieve the desired object from the Tempest 
you must spend 1 Angst point and 1 Willpower point, then 

make a successful Wits + Tempest Weaving roll. To store an 
object using this art requires only a successful Wits + Tempest 
Weaving  roll.  The  Storyteller  determines  the  specific  capa-
bilities or impact the object has, and may require additional 
expenditures or apply limitations upon the object depending 
on what’s desired — after all, this should not be a cheap way to 
equip yourself permanently with an arsenal of Artifact weapons.
Each time you use this art to retrieve an object, your Psyche 

gains 1 Pathos point.
••••• Chaos Carving

The Spectre forces his will upon the seething Tempest, reshap-
ing it into whatever form he desires. This is the art used to carve 
settings for Harrowings from the raw stuff of Oblivion — anything 
from a long-forgotten family home to a company boardroom.

System: Spend 2 Angst points and 1 Willpower, then roll 
Intelligence  +  Tempest  Weaving.  The  number  of  successes 
indicates the degree of accuracy and detail achieved — 1 suc-
cess means a match of the room dimensions and basic furniture, 
while 5 successes produces a fully equipped and functional space 
with all the comforts of home. This art can only create items 
and objects. If used for a Harrowing, other Spectres must take 
on the roles of anyone in the space.

Shadecraft

In addition to Dark Arcanoi, Shades have access to uniquely 
monstrous abilities known simply as Shadecraft. A Shade has 
at  least  one  of  these  arts,  though  it  is  not  unusual  for  more 
powerful ones to have as many as four or five. 

A number of these arts require the Shade to first get a target 
in a clinch; see “Close Combat Maneuvers,” p. 331, for details.
Chameleon Parasite

This art allows a Shade to attach herself inconspicuously 
to a wraith. As long as she remains quiescent, the Shade goes 
anywhere the wraith does, even into the Shadowlands. Malfeans 
are known to spy upon the Hierarchy in this manner. It’s also 
used  to  make  tactical  strikes  by  gaining  entry  into  a  wraith 
stronghold,  where  the  Shade  detaches  herself  and  causes  as 
much carnage as possible before vanishing into the Tempest.

System: Spend 5 Angst and roll Dexterity + Stealth in a 
resisted action against the target’s Perception + Alertness. If 
successful, the Shade attaches herself almost invisibly to the 
target. Any extra successes are added to the Shade’s dice pool 
for avoiding detection. The parasitical Shade is virtually invis-
ible. The most effective means of detection is to hold a strong 
light source up to the wraith’s Corpus, allowing observers to 
roll Perception + Awareness in a resisted action against the 
Shade’s Dexterity + Stealth. 

The  Shade  can  maintain  this  state  almost  indefinitely, 
though  she  must  spend  1  Angst  each  day  that  she  remains 
outside of the Tempest. Upon detaching, the Shade inflicts 1 
aggravated Corpus level of damage on her host.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Hound the Harrowed

The Shade can attach 
herself  to  a  wraith  who  is 
undergoing  a  Harrowing. 
The Shade may try to intercept 
any  Willpower  or  Pathos  the 
wraith  spends  during  the  Har-
rowing,  converting  it  to  the 

Shade’s own use.

System:  Each  time  the  Shade 
wishes to intercept a Willpower or Pa-
thos use, roll Dexterity + Awareness in 
a resisted action against the target’s Strength 
+ Subterfuge or Willpower + 2 (whichever is 
higher). The Shade intercepts 1 point for each 
extra success rolled, and may apply it to 
her own Willpower pool or Angst pool 
as she prefers.

Imprison

The Shade twists her body to envelop a 
target completely. Shades often employ this art 
to carry wraiths off into the Tempest, though 
they have also been known to hide even more 
Shades  within  themselves,  bursting  open  to 
release them at an appropriate moment.

System: In the turn after a successful clinch, 
spend 2 Angst and make a resisted Strength + 
Brawl  roll  against  the  opponent.  If  successful, 
the Shade envelops her opponent and compress 
him into a ball of Corpus roughly the size of a 
football. The victim is unable to take any action 
while imprisoned, and cannot be freed unless the 
Shade wishes it or is reduced to 1 Corpus level 
(or less). Once released, the victim returns to his 
normal shape within one turn.
Miasmal Breath
The Shade exhales a noxious vapor, akin to the 
black winds of Oblivion that moan through the Labyrinth.
System: The Shade spends 1 Angst point for each ag-
gravated Corpus level of damage that she wants to inflict, then 
rolls Dexterity + Athletics in a ranged combat attack. Miasmal 
Breath  spews  from  the  Shade’s  mouth,  covering  a  two-yard/
meter diameter. As the Spectre is essentially exhaling the raw 
stuff of Oblivion, this damage cannot be soaked or resisted.
Numb the Heart

The Shade attacks a wraith’s Passions directly, infecting 

them with the stain of Oblivion.

System: In the turn after a successful clinch, spend 3 Angst 
and make a resisted Willpower roll against the opponent. Every 
2 extra successes the Shade rolls reduces one of the victim’s 

SPECTRES

359

Ectoplasmic Tentacles

The Shade sprouts additional “limbs” — in truth, muscular, 
whip-like tentacles — that she can use as deftly as her hands. 
Shades that employ this art seldom use weapons.

System: The Shade may use her tentacles to make a second 
attack in the turn. The tentacles inflict aggravated damage. 
Further, they reduce the difficulty by 2 for any Athletics rolls. 
The additional limbs are permanent and require no Angst to use.

Passion  ratings  by  1  permanently,  starting  with  the  wraith’s 
weakest Passion.
Pathos Drain

The  Shade  latches  onto  and  literally  drains  the  Pathos 
from a wraith. This art is a favorite of Shades, as there is noth-
ing quite like the charge a Spectre gets from twisting a wraith’s 
energy and mainlining it into Angst.

System: In the turn after a successful clinch, make a resisted 
Willpower roll against the opponent. For each extra success the 
Shade rolls, she drains 1 Pathos from the target and converts it 
to Angst to add to her pool.
Rend the Lifeweb

This art can be especially unnerving to wraiths, since the 
Shade  attacks  their  Fetters  by  striking  through  the  wraiths 
themselves.

System: In the turn after a successful clinch, spend 5 Angst 
and make a resisted Willpower roll against the opponent. Every 2 
extra successes the Shade rolls reduces one of the victim’s Fetter 
ratings by 1 permanently, starting with the wraith’s weakest Fetter.
Shark’s Teeth

The Shade’s mouth is split into a gaping maw filled with 

multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth.

System: The Shade can make a bite attack that inflicts 

aggravated damage (see p. 294).
Siphon Emotion

The Shade attacks an opponent’s Passions, actually draining 

and transferring the energy.

System: In the turn after a successful clinch, make a resisted 
Willpower roll against the opponent. For each extra success 
the Shade rolls, she drains 1 Passion point permanently from 
the target (starting with the weakest Passion) and transfers the 
point to the Dark Passion of her choosing.
Spectral Scream

The Shade unleashes a shriek into the Tempest that un-

nerves foes and calls additional Shades to her side.

System: Spend 5 Angst and roll Manipulation + Leadership; 
each success represents one Shade that appears, to a maximum 
of  five  Shades.  The  Storyteller  determines  the  method  and 
timing of each Shade’s arrival, though typically they burst from 
a nearby Nihil within three turns. Further, any wraiths in the 
area who hear the scream’s soul-scouring hatred are subject to 
a +1 difficulty on all rolls for the remainder of the scene.
Stampede

Shades often run in packs. By employing this deadly art, 
Shades of a single pack can combine their physical talents to 
inflict brutal damage on their foes.

System: Each Shade with this art who spends 1 Angst and 
1 Willpower joins in a synchronized attack, using teamwork 
(p. 101). They must all perform the same physical maneuver 
(strike, claw, etc.); while each Shade rolls separately, the result-
ing successes on the attack are combined into a single result, 
as is any subsequent damage roll.
Talons

The Shade’s hands end in wicked, tearing claws.
System: The Shade can make a claw attack that inflicts 

aggravated damage (see p. 294).
Tempest Wrack

The Shade infects the surrounding Tempest with her own 
inner turmoil, making it manifest. Turbulence erupts into storms, 
whirlpools  suck  down  placid  Byways,  and  similar  upheaval 
explodes in the Spectre’s immediate vicinity.

System: Spend 2 Angst and 1 Willpower, then roll Will-
power. The number of successes indicates the additional dif-
ficulty applied to all actions within the area for the remainder 
of the scene. While all characters are subject to this increased 
difficulty,  remember  that  Spectres  ignore  any  increased  dif-
ficulties to Mental Traits due to environmental conditions in 
the Tempest (p. 330).

Mortwights

Mortwights are mortals who died with such violence that 
they became Spectres instantly, never having existed as wraiths. 
While new to the Underworld, they have had an increasing 
impact on Spectre society since the time of the Fifth Great 
Maelstrom. Technically without a formal caste, and so the low-
est of all Shadow-Eaten, the Mortwight population has swelled 
to the point where they may soon demand their rightful due.

As  warriors  of  Oblivion,  Mortwights  are  superb.  Their 
greatest asset is their command of the Tempest, both in naviga-
tion and in summoning substance from the chaos. They excel 
at calling matter and memories from the storm to use as props 
in Harrowings, or as weapons when waylaying Byway travelers.
Appearance

Of all Spectres, Mortwights hew most closely to their mor-
tal appearance. Their eyes are not Shadow-dark, nor are their 
bodies yet ravaged by Oblivion. Only their death wounds mark 
them as servants of Oblivion. In the Tempest, these wounds 
bleed constantly, though without causing harm, leaking minute 
amounts of Corpus that the Tempest itself replenishes instantly. 
However, a Mortwight who leaves the Tempest begins losing 
Corpus  constantly  until  she  returns  to  the  healing  embrace 
of the Tempest. Along with a lack of cohesive internal orga-
nization, this physical limitation is the main impediment to 
Mortwights’ social ascension, as other Spectres perceive them 
as critically flawed.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Striplings

As the name implies, these Spectral children are born from 
those who died before reaching adolescence. While Striplings 
are  technically  found  within  every  caste,  as  well  as  among 
Mortwights,  they  have  bonded  across  caste  lines  over  their 
shared temperament. The very idea of a group that ignores the 
rigid  caste  system  has  scandalized  Spectre  society,  but  these 
children of the Void have become so plentiful and powerful 
none yet dares move against them.

Prior to the 13th century, children reborn as wraiths were 
repurposed  as  raw  materials  the  moment  they  entered  the 
Shadowlands. Then came the Children’s Crusade. Among the 
handful of child Spectres born in the aftermath of that event 
was  one  called  Jemima  Screech.  She  was  the  first  of  many 
Striplings who gave sufficient voice as to earn the right to be 
more than soulforge fodder. Then came the dawn of the mortal 
Industrial Age, and with it a veritable flood of Striplings caused 
by child deaths due to appalling factory conditions. Stripling 
numbers  continue  to  grow  into  the  21st  century  due  to  the 
ravages of poverty, disease, and war across the globe, and the 
more Striplings created, the more there are to welcome other 
children to their macabre play circle.

Striplings  exist  to  lure  children  closer  to  Oblivion.  In 
the Shadowlands, they work to provoke the Shadows of child 

Enfants, posing as playmates tempting them to bad behavior. 
Striplings leverage their expertise at Shroud Rending to ap-
ply deadly influence over the Quick. In the Skinlands, they 
encourage  children  to  lethal  pastimes,  whether  toying  with 
power sockets, playing with their parents’ firearms, or simply 
chasing balls into traffic.
Appearance

Not surprisingly, Striplings appear as corrupt manifesta-
tions of children. Some are skeletal or disfigured, others are 
bloated  and  pus-ridden,  still  others  weep  worms  from  open 
sores.  All  speak  with  unnervingly  soft,  high-pitched  voices, 
their sometimes lisped or childish pronouncements belying the 
malevolence behind their words.

Doppelgangers

Wraiths whose Shadows consume them are reborn as Dop-
pelgangers. They remain much like wraiths in many respects 
—  retaining  their  personalities,  knowledge  of  Arcanoi,  and 
Fetters.  However,  they  are  fully  agents  of  Oblivion.  As  the 
name  suggests,  these  Spectres  are  still  familiar  enough  with 
their former condition that they make the perfect operatives 
to spy upon the Shadowlands.

SPECTRES

361

Doppelgangers still have Fetters, which allows them ac-
cess to the Shadowlands for extended periods. They insinuate 
themselves in wraith society in a number of ways — whether 
maintaining their previous wraith persona, establishing a new 
identity, or even Moliating themselves to imitate influential 
wraiths. Whatever the approach, they strive to learn all they 
can of Stygia’s plans, while at the same time sowing discord 
and  mistrust  between  wraiths.  Doppelgangers  are  master 
manipulators,  gaining  the  confidence  of  others  so  that  they 
might use the secrets they learn to discredit and undermine 
their supposed “friends.”

Fetters are the main reason that Doppelgangers place so low 
in the social order. This very ability that makes them so vital 
to the cause of Oblivion is seen by other castes as a weakness, 
a failure to embrace Oblivion fully.

Doppelgangers are also responsible for furthering the stain 
of Oblivion among the Quick. They delight in driving mortals 
mad, edging them ever closer to suicidal despair or homicidal rage. 
Doppelgangers spread negative emotions such as fear, despair, 
anger, and disgust throughout the Skinlands by targeting victims 
with cunning applications of Embody, Keening, Outrage, and 
Pandemonium. They also use Puppetry to spread chaos directly, 
possessing victims into performing all manner of horrific acts 
including abduction, mass shootings, rape, and terrorism.

Much  like  wraiths,  Doppelgangers  frequent  Skinland 
haunts, though they are the only Spectres who do so. They 
often choose the scene of their death or some other location 
of similar importance to their past life. Their unseen presence 
contaminates the area with melancholy, fury, frustration, and 
other negative emotions that worm their way into mortal souls. 
Doppelgangers  also  play  havoc  with  wraiths’  Fetters.  A 
favorite approach for a location of importance to a wraith is to 
encourage reclamation and gentrification projects that destroy 
or transform the site beyond recognition. Those with a flair for 
the dramatic may instead encourage mortal firebugs to burn 
the place down. For direct assaults on Fetters, Doppelgangers 
are  known  to  Skinride  mortals,  burning  books,  vandalizing 
memorials, shredding garments, and the like.

In addition to Argos, which allows them to move about the 
Tempest at will, Doppelgangers often become skilled in Arcanoi 
that help them in subterfuge and manipulation.
Appearance

While  thinner,  paler,  and  less  substantial  than  wraiths, 
Doppelgangers are not so different as to draw attention. Death-
marks resembling postmortem lividity are often blotched across 
their Corpus, but judicious use of Moliate can disguise the stain 
of Oblivion. Indeed, even Castigate will not always reveal a 
Doppelganger’s true nature.

The one thing that Doppelgangers can’t hide is the trium-
phant Shadow that dances behind their eyes. Cautious wraiths 
have learned to look closely at the eyes of all those they meet, 
on the chance that the next stranger might be a Doppelganger 
in disguise.

Doppelganger Factions

Doppelgangers have the most complex social order of all 
the castes, due to their varied roles as agents of Oblivion. While 
individuals from different factions often work together, there 
is a constant rivalry and desire to prove one’s faction superior 
to the others. This has been known to disrupt mission goals, 
though the Spectral mass mind usually keeps things from spiraling 
out of control. These intricate subcultures are typically of no 
concern to anyone except the Doppelgangers themselves, who 
take a perverse pride in their factions and accomplishments.

•  Actors:  These  shapeshifters  are  the  main  actors  in 
Harrowings. They take whatever forms are called for, to better 
torment  the  wraiths  brought  before  them.  They  most  enjoy 
assuming roles of a Harrowed wraith’s tormented loved ones, 
as this evokes the most anguish. Still, they won’t pass up the 
chance to take any role that assists a Shadow in threatening 
or  torturing  its  wraith  directly.  Whatever  their  role,  Actors 
relish a Harrowing, since it generates powerful emotions that 
refuel their pathos.

•  Assassins:  These  Doppelgangers  launch  attacks  on 
wraiths  in  Necropoli  and  elsewhere  in  the  Shadowlands.  In 
addition to the damage caused, these Spectres feed off the pain, 
fear, and anger their attacks generate. Assassins typically oper-
ate in small groups, though lone Assassins are not unheard of. 
Since striking from the darkness doesn’t require interacting with 
wraith society, these groups may include Spectres from other 
castes, most notably Nephwracks due to their familiarity with 
the Shadowlands, and Doubles who take the place of destroyed 
or kidnapped wraiths.

• Banshees: Using Keening, these Spectres drive wraiths 
closer  to  Oblivion  through  subtle  emotional  manipulation. 
Virtuosos with this Arcanos, Banshees twist wraiths to desire 
only negative emotions and feed off the despair they engender. 
Banshees sometimes aid Assassins by paralyzing wraiths with 
emotion long enough to be overcome by attacking Spectres.

• Conjurers: As masters of Phantasm, Conjurers attack 
wraiths in their very dreams. As the name suggests, a favorite 
tactic involves first conjuring a horror that assaults the wraith’s 
dreamself in a series of nightmares. Once these seeds are sown, 
the Conjurer unleashes an illusion of the same monstrosity while 
the wraith is awake. The Conjurer feasts upon the wraith’s panic 
and agony as it suffers the illusion, unable to tell fantasy from 
reality. Indeed, sometimes the effect is so convincing that the 
wraith is actually destroyed.

•  Doubles:  These  Doppelgangers  disrupt  Underworld 
society from within by assuming the appearance of particular 
wraiths. They may break up friendships, disobey laws and cus-
toms, or spread rumors about influential figures. Once the seeds 
are sown, they slip away and leave the wraith they’ve doubled 
as to face the consequences. Permanent doubling of a destroyed 
or abducted wraith is rare, since it can be challenging for even 
the most skilled Double to maintain another’s persona in the 
long term without being discovered.

362

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

• Goads: While these Spectres infiltrate wraith society, 
they take no direct action against wraiths. Instead, Goads be-
friend wraiths and subtly encourage their darker urges. From 
the position of trusted friend or mentor, a Goad suggests actions 
designed to strengthen a wraith’s Shadow self, or argue against 
beliefs  and  values  to  erode  a  wraith’s  confidence.  Working 
with other factions, a Goad may set up an ambush or other 
situation that forces a wraith to embrace dark emotions or call 
upon the Shadow for aid. When a wraith succumbs at last, the 
Goad snatches her away to the Labyrinth and feasts upon her 
terror and despair.

• Leeches: These Doppelgangers are parasites, plain and 
simple. Nearly transparent, they attach themselves to wraiths 
and siphon off their Pathos and Corpus. The absorbed soul stuff 
is used as needed — whether as a direct transfer, converting 
Pathos to Angst, or changing Corpus to Pathos. A Leech who 
siphons sparingly may remain a parasite for some time as the 
host  eventually  weakens  or  is  even  destroyed.  Conversely,  a 
Leech steals enough Corpus in one go to plunge its host into 
the Labyrinth, where waiting Actors swarm for a Harrowing. 
Once the Corpus is gone, the Leech moves on to a new host.
• Oddities: These strange beings employ Arcanoi in un-
usual ways and craft intricate plans to entrap wraiths, making 
them among the most dangerous of all Spectres. Some Oddi-
ties befuddle travelers into becoming trapped in the sea wrack 
that floats in clumps through the Tempest, others transform 
themselves into animate weapons by Moliating shards of Sty-
gian steel into their bodies, and still others peel off their outer 
Corpus to create hollow duplicates that they control with a 
variation of Collogue.

• Riders: These Spectres’ focus is on the Skinlands. Riders 
control mortals through Puppetry, whether to perform violent 
acts  and  sow  chaos,  or  to  nurture  cults  dedicated  to  hatred, 
fear, torture, and death. The souls culled from these efforts are 
often primed to go straight to Oblivion. On occasion, Riders 
manage to dominate prominent figures, contributing to murder-
ous regimes, war crimes, social unrest, corporate malfeasance, 
environmental disasters, and other tragedies.

• Spiders: These Doppelgangers are experts in Lifeweb. 
They focus on destroying wraiths’ Fetters and claiming mortal 
souls for Oblivion. Destroying Fetters requires time and patience, 
as the Spider investigates a target to confirm that wraith’s Fetters 
and her relationship to them — all while not drawing the slight-
est suspicion. Once confident that every Fetter is confirmed, 
the Spider destroys each in turn, thereby cutting the wraith’s 
ties to the living world. The resulting anguish, fear, and anger 
this generates are a veritable feast to a Spider.

Seducing  mortals  is  a  much  easier  proposition.  Mortals 
are often all too willing to promise their souls to Oblivion in 
the future in exchange for supernatural help in the present. 
Becoming a Spider’s Fetter is a matter of little concern in the 
heat  of  the  moment.  The  true  price  of  the  deal  is  revealed 
once the bound mortal is slain — often by the Spider’s own 

hand — and the soul plummets to Oblivion to be remade into 
yet another Spectre.

• Spies: Into this catchall category fall Doppelgangers who 
are sent to infiltrate wraith enclaves throughout the Shadow-
lands and Dark Kingdoms. They share the knack for blending 
in with local cultures, where they glean rumors and take note 
of defensive capabilities. Some Spies gain positions of power 
that enable them to uncover even the most closely guarded 
secrets and manipulate wraith society to best benefit Oblivion.

Nephwracks

These twisted things are the result of prolonged exposure to 
the entropic effects of Oblivion. Warped and devolved, Neph-
wracks cannot hope to pass for wraiths, not that they would 
even wish to. These creatures revel in displaying an outward 
appearance as twisted and repulsive as the vile darkness that 
lies within. It is this purity of evil that makes them favored 
agents of the Malfeans.

Nephwracks act as emissaries and heralds, serving as the 
voices  of  their  Malfean  masters  throughout  the  Underworld 
and  even  into  the  Skinlands.  They  are  also  known  to  serve 
as priests of Spectral society, interpreting the dreams of their 
sleeping masters for the Shadow-Eaten masses. 

Nephwracks  seldom  venture  far  from  the  depths  of  the 
Tempest. Still, there are rare instances of Nihils leading directly 
to a Nephwrack lair.

Like  all  Spectres,  Nephwracks  possess  some  degree  of 
Argos with which to navigate the Tempest. They often have 
high levels of Keening as well, which they use to bombard their 
enemies with dark emotions.
Appearance

Hideous even by the flexible standards of wraith society, the 
taint of Oblivion is obvious on a Nephwrack. Its touch warps 
them into mockeries of their mortal selves. A heroin addict’s 
Corpus might bear ulcerated, gaping puncture marks, while a 
domestic abuser’s Spectral body might be twisted into knots of 
rage, hands clenched into club-like fists.

Shades

Shades are born of wraiths lost to their Shadows during a 
Harrowing, devoured by the Tempest, or swallowed by Oblivion 
in a Maelstrom. The violence of such encounters strips away 
most of the wraith’s personality and intellect, leaving a mind-
less, howling beast.

Shades seek only to corrupt and annihilate. They are the 
shock troops of Oblivion, knowing no purpose other than de-
struction. Whenever Spectres attack in force, Shades lead the 
charge. Whenever a Maelstrom sweeps through the Underworld, 
Shades are at the forefront of the soulstorm. Even other Spectres 
are leery of Shades, for they can be unpredictable, especially 
in groups. Their stampedes of devastation swarm over enemy 
and ally alike.

SPECTRES

363

Shades are the stuff of nightmares, the howling of Oblivion 
given physical form. Some appear as scaled demons from hu-
man myth, while others are little more than gaping maws and 
slashing claws held together by a tangle of sinew and torn skin. 
They radiate the cold blackness of Oblivion the most powerfully 
of all Spectres, save Malfeans. The more powerful a Shade, the 
greater the flickering black light that surrounds them.

Appearance

Malfeans

The mightiest of all Spectres, Malfeans fall into two types: 
The Neverborn, great beasts that were never human; and the 
so-called Onceborn, former wraiths who have become godlike in 
their enduring evil. Regardless of their origins, they all grow to 
enormous stature and wield power unparalleled in the Underworld.
Malfeans make their lairs deep in the Labyrinth, in caverns 
gnawed out of nothingness at the time of the Sundering. Here 
they may slumber for centuries, direct invasions against this Dark 
Kingdom or that Necropolis, or speak of the dreams of Oblivion 
and the final peace that awaits in the Void. Nephwracks fawn 
around  them  in  eager  supplication,  while  armies  of  Shades 
swarm in the darkness awaiting their commands.

Malfeans are the god-kings of Spectral society. Terrible, 
twisted beings, they seldom leave their lairs within the Tem-

pest. When they do, it is to spread chaos and suffering on an 
unheard-of scale. Perhaps the most infamous instance involves 
the devastating battle between ancient Gorool and the Stygian 
ruler Charon. Other Malfeans of note include Lamachis the 
Devourer, whose wanderings traverse the Shadowlands of the 
Americas; Rabark the Inhabited, whose corpulent mass serves 
as home to numerous lesser Spectres like so many parasites; and 
Mulhecturous the Putrescent, whose Nephwrack servitors spread 
disease and death among her mortal worshippers.

Indeed, many Malfeans spread Oblivion by setting them-
selves up as deities, worshipped by the Quick and the dead alike. 
They often employ Nephwracks to manifest and possess mortal 
cultists as evidence of their supernatural influence. Such mortal 
cults are often innocent of what it is that they worship, believing 
themselves to be servants of some other spiritual entity. Under 
the aegis of divine inspiration, these cults spread degradation 
and despair throughout the Skinlands.

Other  Malfeans,  such  as  Lamachis,  seek  more  palpable 
power  on  both  sides  of  the  Shroud.  In  the  Skinlands,  their 
servants  are  often  Skinridden  mortals  in  governments  and 
multinational corporations. In the Shadowlands, their influence 
extends over numerous Heretic cults and Renegade gangs though 
those wraiths are often unwitting minions, believing that their 
efforts promote Transcendence or freedom from the Hierarchy.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

STORYTELLING MALFEANS

A  Malfean  may  serve  as  the  great  villain 
behind  an  elaborate  plot  that  drives  an  entire 
campaign.  Certainly,  wraiths  new  to  existence 
would have no chance if facing such an opponent. 
A Malfean is best employed as a background figure 
manipulating events from deep in the shadows, 
and whose influence, let alone existence, wraiths 
aren’t even aware of for some time. Revealing a 
Malfean’s  involvement  should  be  a  watershed 
moment in the chronicle, and confronting one 
should be an experience that both characters and 
players never forget.

It  can  be  challenging  to  create  a  Malfean 
character that is not simply a slobbering caricature 
of gluttony. If using a Malfean for something other 
than a terrible scare, the Storyteller is encouraged 
to delineate its powers and take the time to craft 
a unique personality and motivation.

By definition, Malfeans are stupendous in size 
and power. Going directly against even a lesser 
Malfean of the Onceborn would require a small 
army — and even then, the best victory wraiths 
could hope for is to survive the encounter.

The Neverborn

In  the  bleak  nothingness  before  time,  ravenous  beasts 
— grim manifestations of destruction — rose from the Utter 
Darkness that lay beneath the Shadowlands and carved great 
tunnels to the heart of Oblivion. This network of chaos became 
the Labyrinth, and the beings that made their lairs within it 
were named Malfeans.

These  ancient  things  came  to  be  called  Neverborn,  to 
distinguish them from those Malfeans born of former wraiths. 
While cunning and unpredictable, these entities — also called 
Grotesques or Primordials — are slaves to their bestial natures. 
They respect only power as mighty as their own, attack anything 
that enters their territory, and venture forth in search of prey 
only when their hunger becomes great enough to wake them 
from  their  endless  slumbers.  Appetite  personified,  they  are 
breathtaking in size, a result of consuming countless denizens 
of  the  Underworld  over  the  course  of  millennia.  Still,  their 
hunger is never sated.

Most Neverborn hover on the border between dream and 
waking. Conscious enough to make their wishes known, they 
never  fully  emerge  from  sleep.  This  is  for  the  best,  as  when 
they awaken they are howling, massive engines of unstoppable 
consumption.  When  a  single  Neverborn  awakens,  the  very 
Labyrinth shudders, and ripples of the orgy of destruction that 
follows echo through the Underworld.

Onceborn

Some Spectres have echoed the behavior of the Neverborn 
— consuming wraiths, other Spectres, and any other source 
of sustenance they can find — to amass both physical stature 
and power sufficient to earn Malfean status. They came to be 
called the Onceborn, to signify their origins. Others called them 
Cabalists, due to their vast intellects as compared to the bestial 
Neverborn. Cabalists are also driven by hunger, but not solely 
for consumption; their appetite is for dominance.

When Doppelgangers, Nephwracks, or Shades embark on 
missions, it is usually at the behest of a power-hungry Onceborn. 
Some claim that they cause Maelstroms, hoarding energy and 
Spectre servitors for years only to unleash everything in a single 
destructive eruption.

Prodigies are far more active than their bestial brethren, 
though  most  prefer  sending  servants  to  do  their  bidding  to 
risking themselves in battle directly. Their minds are agile and 
treacherous, and they endlessly war with one another through 
proxies over control of sections of the ever-shifting Labyrinth.

Spectres and the Storyteller

s Spectres have short, intense, and brutal 
existences, stories that focus on them should 
have  a  similar  passion  and  urgency.  This 
section  begins  with  a  discussion  of  using 
Spectres as antagonists in a wraith chronicle, 
followed by guidelines for creating a Spectre-
oriented chronicle. This is, of course, just 
the  starting  point;  the  Storyteller  is  encouraged  to  develop 
whatever mood, theme, story arcs, and story hooks best suit 
the chronicle she has in mind.

Spectre as Foe

Spectres are the most common antagonists that wraiths will 
face. The two share many similarities — both are incorporeal 
and deathly, sustain themselves on Passion, and inhabit a reality 
ravaged by Oblivion and isolated from the mortal world they once 
knew. However, it’s a mistake to think of Spectres as simply “bad 
wraiths.” The Shadow-Eaten are uncaring and angry, despairing 
and hateful, bitter and twisted. They know that their existence 
is brief, and throw themselves fully into their roles as agents of 
Oblivion. As such, they serve as a reminder of the fate that awaits 
all wraiths who become detached from their Fetters and Passions, 
and who compromise too much with their whispering Shadows.
As the interests of wraiths and Spectres are often in direct 
conflict, the Shadow-Eaten are natural foes for a wraith chronicle. 
Additionally, Spectres are cunning, merciless beasts who may seduce 
wraiths into joining the ranks of Oblivion or destroy them outright. 
Spectres represent “the Other” — they are a manifestation of the 
Shadow,  the  embodiment  of  a  wraith’s  fears  and  inadequacies. 
They understand Oblivion in ways that no wraith can, or would 

SPECTRES

365

want to. Still, some wraiths may see something seductive about 
the apparent freedom and power that Spectres enjoy.

The Shadow-Eaten are more than monsters wandering in 
the Tempest. Their motivations and agendas can create complex 
relationships with wraith characters beyond the obvious “fight 
or flight” dichotomy. Mortwights are horrifying and mysterious, 
born directly from violent death — a fate that the characters 
may have come close to suffering themselves. Striplings are a 
sickening combination of innocence and evil, evidence to the 
characters of an uncaring universe. Doppelgangers are skilled 
infiltrators and pose as wraiths in most Necropoli, and could 
become  influential  patrons  or  close  confidants  without  the 
characters realizing it. Nephwracks may be old friends that the 
characters once knew, warped by Oblivion — though not quite 
beyond recognition — and come back to haunt them. Shades 
are relentless hunters, dogging the characters’ every step once 
they get a whiff of their Shadows’ nourishing Angst. Malfeans 
are mighty nemeses, marshaling forces that threaten all exis-
tence — starting with the characters themselves.

Then there’s the interaction between Spectre and Shadow. 
Being allies of a wraith’s Shadow lends Spectres special signifi-
cance as enemies. Spectres have embraced that part of themselves 
that  the  character  constantly  struggles  against.  Employing 
Arcanoi and manipulation, Spectres side with the Shadow in 
this fight, making them frightening adversaries indeed — for 
what is more terrifying than waging war against yourself?

Even so, wraiths can try a similar approach against Spec-
tres. While a Spectre may strive to bolster a wraith’s Shadow 
to drag her to the side of Oblivion, the wraith may support that 
Spectre’s Psyche in a bid for redemption. Such maneuverings 
offer rich fodder for plots and adventures.

Spectres’ plots and machinations, grand aims, and deadly 
schemes ensure them a memorable role in every wraith-oriented 
chronicle.

Spectre as Protagonist

Running  a  chronicle  wherein  players  take  on  the  roles 
of Spectres makes them the protagonists of the story, though 
certainly not the heroes. Creatures of utter nihilism, Spectres 
hope only that they might end their own pain by ending all 
existence. Creating and understanding this feeling is critical 
for a successful Spectre chronicle.
Mood

An atmosphere of decay and horror is the glue that binds a 
Spectre chronicle together. In addition, within specific stories 
that make up the chronicle, the Storyteller might emphasize 
certain moods that build off these cornerstones — fear, hate, 
isolation, and madness.

Decay
Oblivion clouds Spectres’ perceptions. Everything they 
see is rotten and decayed. The Shadowlands are shrouded in 

darkness, while stained clouds blanket the sky at all times. 
The only illumination that Spectres see is the black light 
of Oblivion, its putrid glow illuminating the decayed hell 
of the Underworld.

When  running  a  Spectre  campaign,  the  Storyteller  is 
encouraged  to  express  the  desolation  with  vivid  description 
—  thick  shadows,  grasping  cobwebs,  brittle  shards  of  glass, 
crumbling concrete, oily fog, stinging rain, sour air, choking 
dryness, and so on.

Remember  that,  in  most  circumstances,  Spectres  only 
perceive  other  denizens  of  the  Underworld.  They  are  so  far 
removed from the living world that mortals and animals are 
effectively invisible to them. Plant life is glimpsed here and 
there, but through the dark filter of spectral perception: gnarled 
trees  devoid  of  leaves,  twisting  vines  blackened  with  soot, 
coarse grass clattering in the dank breeze. Unpaved earth is 
bare, blasted by frost or scorched by fire. Ashes and sleet drift 
in on the relentless wind.

In contrast to the bleak Shadowlands, the Tempest is a 
nightmare of slick, towering waves, shrieking winds, and roiling 
clouds the color of static.

Horror
In  Wraith,  horror  comes  from  being  separated  from 
the world of the living, and from the knowledge that one’s 
Shadow is waiting to take control the moment you relax your 
guard. The Shadow-Eaten are not concerned with such fears. 
They are truly malevolent beings, and playing one is not to 
be taken lightly.

A Spectre chronicle should not be an exercise in “torture 
porn,” wherein players become inured to the brutality and 
vile acts that their characters espouse. Rather, a healthier 
and more enjoyable game experience revolves around the 
brief nature of Spectral existence. Remind your players that 
Spectres are fireflies, flitting about frantically for one mo-
ment in time until Oblivion claims them. Decay gnaws at 
their Corpus each day, their reward for acting tirelessly in 
service to the Void.

This  should  open  new  avenues  to  explore.  Spectres  are 
doomed; no matter how they might struggle, they will fall to 
the Void eventually. And yet, this frees them to take terrible 
chances. This perverse dichotomy is at the heart of the horror 
that the Shadow-Eaten experience, and can make for compel-
ling roleplaying.

Fear
Fear motivates many Spectres. Stories within a chronicle 
may highlight a Spectre’s fear of his Psyche, or a more pervasive 
fear of the Void. Indeed, this fear might be a primary motiva-
tion for the villain of the story (such as a Nephwrack seeking to 
stave off his dissolution at the cost of the characters’ existence); 
alternately,  fear  of  the  Spectres  themselves  may  draw  other 
entities into conflict with the characters.

366

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Hate
Hate is a powerful force that can create a driving urgency 
throughout  the  course  of  a  chronicle.  Individual  stories  can 
explore different outlets for hate, whether motivating Hierarchy 
forces to hunt the Spectres down, or brewing conflict between 
rival characters. Vivid descriptions of the environment can re-
inforce the mood effectively, from the growling fury of Tempest 
storms to the shadows that swell and flicker in the black light 
of Oblivion as if with a sentient hunger.

Isolation
While all Spectres are connected through the hive mind, 
few ever feel a sense of belonging or support. The Psyche is 
the only constant companion, and it strives to undermine the 
Spectre at every turn. Alternately, the chronicle may revolve 
around more practical interpretations of isolation — the Spectres 
may be lost in distant reaches of the Labyrinth, or navigating 
the Shadowlands in search of a rumored Artifact.

Madness
This  is  an  obvious  fit  for  any  Spectre  chronicle.  Seen 
from the perspective of wraiths, Spectres are mad. Such stories 
might hold the Spectres’ behavior as a mirror to other beings 
with whom they interact, whether mortal innocents who cry 
out for mercy at the horrors they’re being subjected to, or the 
condemnation of Doomslayers who seek to unleash retribution 
upon them. Then again, the mood can support the idea that 
madness can be a gift as well as a curse, a way of dealing with 
the agony of Spectral existence.

Spectre Themes

A theme draws the many elements of a story into a coher-
ent whole. Without a theme, a chronicle is simply a series of 
events, lacking cohesion, depth, and direction.
Despair

This theme lends itself to a chronicle with a philosophi-
cal bent. A despair-themed chronicle might have the char-
acters suffering personal setbacks, or even consist entirely 
of stories in which their every action sends them spiraling 
further downward to the Void. Consider the larger scope as 
well:  What  could  drive  the  Shadow-Eaten,  creatures  that 
literally  sustain  themselves  on  Dark  Passions,  to  despair? 
Spectres have failed to destroy all existence despite centuries 
of effort, yet they strive on unflaggingly; what might it take 
to despair of reaching their goal?

After all, a Spectre is doomed no matter what she tries. 
Oblivion  eats  away  more  of  her  each  day,  and  her  Psyche 
hounds her without pause. In the face of such hopelessness, 
what’s the point? Do Spectres revolt against the old ways, seek 
a new path? Amuse themselves by toying with mortals or war-
ring among the dead?

Destruction

Destruction can be applied in myriad ways. The inventive 
Storyteller should have little problem deciding on a viable ap-
proach for his chronicle.

As  agents  of  entropy,  Spectres  tear  down  individuals  as 
well as things — whether their physical forms, their psyches, 
or their beliefs. A destruction-themed chronicle may focus on 
Spectres’ plans to destroy a particular Necropolis, with stories 
about infiltrating the city, investigating its weak points (both 
physically and in leadership), compromising Hierarchy officials, 
and hijacking a transport to use as a Trojan horse, all leading 
to a full-scale attack that turns a Citadel to rubble.

Another chronicle may relate more to personal destruc-
tion,  with  the  characters  spreading  disbelief  and  disillusion-
ment among mortals, and focusing on scenes set at a Skinlands 
university or involving cultists and pawns.

Spectre Chronicle Concepts

The best Spectre chronicle is focused, intense, and short — 
ideally no longer than four to six sessions — dealing with one 
specific theme or issue. The Storyteller should steer away from 
complicated subplots and ensure that unnecessary detail does 
not slow down the action. This style of roleplaying makes for 
a fast-paced, yet memorable, chronicle, as the Storyteller pulls 
out all the stops and races the troupe toward a dramatic climax.
• Conquering the Necropolis: Arguably the archetypi-
cal Spectre chronicle, this concept focuses on the characters’ 
efforts to infiltrate, assault, and destroy a Necropolis. Do the 
characters  manipulate  disgruntled  Renegades  or  misguided 
exiles to sow unrest? Assassinate key Hierarchy leadership to 
weaken stability? Negotiate with a Malfean to add its minions 
to the assault? There are opportunities aplenty for subterfuge 
and action alike.

• Dark Passions: With this concept, each story centers on 
a particular Dark Passion. This could mean focusing on a differ-
ent character’s Dark Passion each time, or a Dark Passion that 
all the characters share. This chronicle is more about thematic 
coherence than a structured plotline, and could be dreamlike 
or surreal in execution.

• Live Fast, Die Young: In this concept, the characters 
are Striplings. Their mortal life over far too soon, they are even 
more confused than most in being “reborn” as Spectres. This 
chronicle should emphasize the fever-pitch mood of being a 
Spectre  in  every  aspect,  from  the  very  beginning  of  coming 
to terms with their new state as Spectres to the inevitable fall 
to Oblivion.

• The Meaning of Oblivion: At the heart of this con-
cept  is  the  debate  of  whether  Oblivion  is  a  sentient  force, 
an  insatiable  entity  strengthened  by  the  spread  of  violence, 
despair, and disbelief; or a literal force of nature, implacable 
entropy with no agenda; it simply is. This could venture deep 
into philosophical territory, an intimate chronicle focused on 

SPECTRES

367

interactions and dialogue between the characters. The Story-
teller may decide the answer one way or the other in advance, 
or let the characters’ actions and debates sway things so that 
they reach their own conclusions.

•  Metamorphosis:  This  concept  is  split  between  the 
characters’  wraithly  existence  and  rebirth  as  Spectres.  The 
logistics can get a bit complicated, as the theme and mood of 
each may be distinctly different — after all, wraiths aspire to 
Transcendence, while Spectres strive for Oblivion. Still, it can 
make for an engaging series of stories, as the newborn Spectres 
relate to past associates, one another, and even their Fetters in 
decidedly different ways than before.

• Prophets of Oblivion: This demanding concept puts the 
players in the roles of Nephwracks, the so-called “priests” of 
Oblivion. Stories might involve steering the course of Spectre 
society  based  on  the  characters’  interpretations  of  Malfean 
commands or even the whispers of Oblivion itself. Other stories 
might focus on manipulating human cults and expanding the 
stain of Oblivion throughout the mortal world.

• The World’s End: This concept delves into the charac-
ters’ attempts to literally destroy the world. Such high stakes 
are sure to involve all manner of enemies and complications, 
from  tangling  with  Hierarchy  forces  to  striking  deals  with 
apocalypse-worshipping  mortal  cultists  or  even  supernatural 
beings like Sabbat vampires or Black Spiral Dancer werewolves.

Spectre Story Concepts

Stories are the adventures that make up a chronicle, the 
meat in the sandwich. A story may have a narrow focus (the 
characters  haunt  a  particular  location)  or  a  broad  one  (the 
characters  scare  a  mortal  to  death,  then  must  deal  with  the 
vengeful  wraith  hunting  them  down).  Multiple  stories  may 
overlap or be self-contained. The examples below are simply 
starting points for generating ideas that best suit the chronicle’s 
overall theme and mood.

• A-Viking: The Spectres go soul-surfing across the Tem-
pest, or are carried on a minor Maelstrom across the Shadow-
lands. What adventures are they caught up in along the way, 
and what other entities do they encounter within the storm? 
Where do they ultimately end up, and how will they get back to 
the Labyrinth? Are they trapped in one of the strange Shifting 
Zones in the Sea of Shadows? What happens if the characters 
find themselves tossed aboard the Midnight Express?

• Reconnaissance and Reverence: A typical day begins 
with the Spectres rising from Slumber in the glacial Labyrinth 
walls, answering the summons of a Nephwrack factor and pre-
senting themselves in the chambers of a hibernating Malfean. 
As the colossus grumbles and snores amid its dark dreams, the 
factor explains the duties that the sleeping Malfean decreed 
for them via the hive mind. The Spectres go on a reconnais-

368

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

sance tour in a distant portion of the Labyrinth, where their 
surroundings — from walls that ripple like mercury and ground 
that quivers with every step — reflect views dredged from their 
Psyches of their happy pasts. Why has the Malfean sent them 
here — or did it? Are they meant to discover something of use 
in spreading Oblivion, or did the Nephwrack want them gone 
while some other plot unfolds?

• Objects of Worship: After enacting a graphic haunting, 
the Spectres find that they have become the focus of a minor 
mortal or supernatural cult. How do the characters react? Will 
they attempt to build their influence to possibly rival the Mal-
feans themselves in clout and destructive potential? Will they 
turn the cultists against one another and incite a bloodbath? 
What if the cult draws the attention of exorcists, witch hunters, 
and others who might trouble the characters directly? Worse 
yet, what if the worship was meant for another, more powerful 
Spectre, who is none too pleased with the characters usurping 
its worshippers?

• Spy Mission: A Malfean commands that the Spectres 
pose as wraiths to discover certain information, perhaps includ-
ing bickering Striplings or an arrogant Nephwrack as part of 
the infiltration team. How do the characters handle scouting 
the Necropolis and navigating wraith politics while avoiding 
discovery? How do they keep the less subtle members of the 
group  from  blowing  their  cover?  Is  the  secret  they’re  meant 
to uncover the end of the mission, or does it reveal a larger 
conspiracy? Do they inadvertently learn too much and become 
targets of a rival Malfean’s forces — or of their own master?

• To Hell and Back: The Spectres are sent to one of the 
many hells that exist among the Far Shores. The ruler of this 
particular one has decided to retire, and his valuable collection 
of souls is up for auction. Perhaps the characters were sent to 
disrupt the bidding, or to ally with the strongest candidates only 
to betray them later and claim the souls for Oblivion. Can the 
characters navigate the dangerous waters of this foreign realm 
and find their way to triumph — or even simply survive?

• The Making of a Harrowing: This story has a darkly 
humorous bent, focusing on what goes into a Harrowing, rather 
than the Harrowing itself. The characters are roped in to help 
a prestigious Nephwrack nightmare director assemble his latest 
masterpiece. Like most productions, this is a frantic scramble 
as the temperamental director harangues everyone to assemble 
scenery, trawl the Tempest for appropriate plots and memories, 
and Moliate themselves to take on roles as extras. Confusion, 
bumbling assistants, and prima donna antics abound, not to 
mention a victim who won’t play by the rules.

Spectre Conflicts

Given Spectres’ turbulent existences, conflict is an intrinsic 
part of their chronicles. The Shadow-Eaten are trying to end 
all of existence, after all. Naturally someone will want to stop 
them. Other conflicts arise from the fractious nature of Spectral 

society, due in no small part to the whims of Malfeans. When 
running Spectre campaigns, one need never look far for a source 
of conflict and drama.
Spectre versus Wraith

The mere existence of Spectres reminds wraiths of what 
they can become. For this reason more than any other, this 
makes  them  the  focus  of  wraiths’  hatred  and  fear.  Stygia  is 
on constant alert against Spectral attack, and the Hierarchy 
regularly launches campaigns into the Labyrinth. Renegades 
alternate at the drop of an obolus between allying with Spectres 
“for the greater good” and fighting them. Heretics are likewise 
troublesome, as more than one Heretic cult has the means to 
raise an army as fanatical as any Shade.
Spectre versus Spectre

Spectres have as much reason to fear attack from within 
their  own  ranks  as  from  external  forces.  Creatures  without 
mercy  or  pity,  Spectres  can  undermine  or  even  destroy  one 
another at the slightest provocation. Manipulators by nature, 
they enjoy intrigue as much as outright violence. Malfean plots 
often enmesh lesser Spectres, but the schemes of Doppelgangers 
can be just as lethal in their own way.
Spectre versus Psyche

A Spectre fears few things; foremost among them is her 
Psyche. The last remnant of its personality to have withstood 
Oblivion, the Psyche and its incessant nagging remind the Spec-
tre that she was once human. The Psyche represents salvation, 
but at the cost of the Spectre’s identity. This forms the core of a 
constant struggle for the entirety of a Spectre’s short existence.
Spectre versus Mortal

Although Spectres are often the hunters, sometimes the 
tables are turned. Mortal parapsychologists might invent equip-
ment that allows them to take the chase into the Shadowlands 
and beyond. Then there are those rare individuals with super-
natural abilities, who can learn to bend Spectres’ minds and 
even souls to their will. Mortals should never be underestimated, 
as more than one Spectre has discovered in the past.
Spectre versus Others

As most Spectres can leave the Tempest for only the briefest 
of moments, they are largely cut off from the rest of the World of 
Darkness. Still, don’t forget that the Underworld is one portion 
of a vast reality that is rife with supernatural beings. Encounters 
with vampires, werewolves, and wizards are not unheard of. In 
some cases, they might share common goals, as in the case of 
the Followers of Set, Black Spiral Dancers, and Nephandi. At 
other times they clash, as when the Giovanni vampires try to 
bend spirits to do their bidding, or Silent Strider Garou cross 
the Shroud to battle those who would destroy their world.

SPECTRES

369

Spectre Characters

 Spectre is a doomed thing, destined to be 
consumed  by  the  Void.  If  any  glory  exists 
in being a Spectre, it is to spread the stain 
of  Oblivion  as  wide  as  possible  before 
succumbing to the inevitable. Yet resisting 
this destruction runs the risk of strengthening 
the  Psyche,  weakening  the  Spectre  and 

making her less effective in her role as an agent of Oblivion.

Playing a Spectre, you are taking on a character that mani-
fests humanity’s worst aspects. Such roleplaying is demanding 
and  intensive,  and  thus  not  for  everyone.  You  may  find  the 
character functioning as an outlet for your personal frustrations, 
fears, and repressed urges. This can be a disturbing realization, 
but it can also be cathartic.

Still, it’s important to remember that Wraith is a game, 
not psychotherapy. While it explores mature themes and can 
sometimes reveal surprising, even shocking, parts of yourself, it is 
intended as a safe, shared entertainment experience. Storyteller 
and  players  alike  should  support  one  another  and  always  be 
clear that actions and experiences being roleplayed are rooted 
firmly within the context of the game.

Playing a Spectre

As covered in the following sections, there are two op-
tions for roleplaying a Spectre: transforming an existing wraith 
character  (see  “Becoming  a  Spectre,”  p.  371)  or  creating  a 
new Spectre character (see “Creating a Spectre,” p. 373) from 
scratch. Whichever method you use, bear in mind that Spectres 
desire no redemption and seek no understanding. Wraiths seek 
completion and finality through resolution of past inadequa-
cies. Spectres are irredeemably evil, and they seek nothing but 
destruction. They are not given to introspection, and make no 
excuses for the deeds they perpetrate.

A  Spectre  chronicle  can  become  tedious  if  there  is  no 
distinction  between  the  various  characters  other  than  how 
many dots they have in their respective Dark Arcanoi. After 
all, just because the Shadow-Eaten are infected with the hive 
mind of Oblivion, that doesn’t mean they comprise a mind-
less swarm. The mass mind merely facilitates communication 
and strips away any delusions of comradeship. The individual 
Spectres remain very much themselves, much to the regret of 
others they might meet. And if a Spectre remembers what she 
did as a wraith — all her goals, dreams, and achievements can 
suddenly be approached from a very different direction.

Two things motivate Spectres: surcease from the wracking 
pain of Oblivion, and their Dark Passions. When you play a 
Spectre, try to personalize the destructive urge. Much like a 
wraith  character’s  Willpower  is  the  essence  of  her  Passions, 
you should have your Spectre character embody the destructive 
aspects represented in his Dark Passions.

It should be possible to say of a Spectre character, “he is 
pure jealousy,” “she is hate personified,” or “he embodies the 
essence  of  spite.”  Countless  motivations  may  produce  evil 
behavior  with  equal  effectiveness  —  the  key  is  to  find  one 
that allows you to focus on what makes your Spectre character 
distinct from the rest.

Spectres  know  that  the  constant,  soul-searing  pain  of 
Oblivion will ultimately consume them. This truth empowers 

PRACTICING SAFE OBLIVION

There’s a tremendous amount of fun to be 
had playing one of the Shadow-Eaten. That be-
ing said, it’s also easy for a Spectre character to 
unbalance or damage an ongoing chronicle, to the 
point where players’ enjoyment is compromised. 
With that in mind, players and Storytellers should 
always remember these basics:

Don’t wantonly wreck the campaign — A 
Spectre whose main motivation is to wreck the 
campaign and destroy the other characters gener-
ally reaches one goal by achieving the other, much 
to the irritation of the other players. A destructive, 
treacherous Spectre character is great, but even 
the most insidious Doppelganger should be after 
something instead of just seeking to destroy what 
the rest of the group has built.

The  Spectre  has  to  want  something  — 
There’s a reason a Spectre sticks around instead 
of just diving into the mouth of the Void to end 
their pain. There’s got to be something worth 
enduring the torments of existence for. Whether 
it’s the sheer joy of doing evil, a specific target 
they want to destroy, or a grand ambition to 
do Oblivion’s work on a large scale, there has 
to  be  a  goal  the  character  is  working  toward 
in order to remain viable and appropriate for 
a chronicle. The Spectre (or the player) might 
not know what it is yet, but finding out can be 
part of the fun.

Don’t be evil (to other players) — Spectres 
are right evil bastards, and playing one should 
involve  doing  evil  things.  That  being  said,  al-
ways make sure the entire group is all right with 
any  potential  Spectral  shenanigans.  Making 
characters  uncomfortable  is  one  thing;  making 
players uncomfortable or feel unwelcome at the 
table is an entirely unwanted other one. “I was 
just roleplaying my character!” is no excuse for 
deliberately  attempting  to  use  the  game  to  do 
harm to another player.

370

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

them  with  the  strength  to  fight  without  fear  of  destruction, 
since their demise is assured already. As a result, there are no 
half measures where Spectres are concerned. Unconcerned with 
survival, they will attack relentlessly and take incredible risks, 
even when the odds are against them.

Considering that Spectres have a brief existence, it’s best 
if players don’t become too attached to their characters. This 
is  not  a  game  of  slow-burn  revelations  and  extended  story 
developments. It’s a fast and brutal exploration of fundamen-
tal ideas. In choosing to play a Spectre, you will take on the 
persona of a fanatical, remorseless, despairing monster without 
conscience or mercy.

Servants of Oblivion

To a Spectre, Oblivion is lover and ruler, confidante and 
torturer,  history  and  future.  Spectral  existence  is  no  process 
of spiritual cleansing. Rather, it’s a ceaseless punishment with 
obliteration  the  only  conclusion.  Oblivion  is  a  demanding 
master, and the Shadow-Eaten live in a reality of pain. How 
can they not despise that which will soon claim them, even as 
it fills them with destructive power? As much as they hate and 
fear Oblivion, Spectres feel even more outrage toward those 
mortals with the temerity to be alive — and the wraiths who 
cling pathetically to a dim mockery of that existence.

Duplicity is common in Spectral thinking. Doppelgang-
ers seek to lure wraiths into the service of Oblivion, a service 
which they themselves loathe. The Spectres gain temporary 
relief from their pain by the thought of the wraith’s impending 
agony; thus do the ranks of Oblivion swell. Wraiths may claim 
that Doppelgangers seek companions in their torment, but the 
ache of Oblivion quickly drives away such desires.

At the other end of the power spectrum, consider Malfeans. 
They defer the end by devouring the lesser Spectres around them 
(along with any captive wraiths whose usefulness has expired). 
In this way, as well as by employing Dark Arcanoi, Malfeans 
stave off Oblivion almost indefinitely. In the end, they serve 
nothing but themselves, motivated by their personal desire to 
cheat Oblivion and hasten it for others. Even those Malfeans 
who seek universal extinction directly often get caught up in 
plots and policies that swell to proportions as gargantuan as they 
are, with lesser Spectres ground up in the process.

It’s  difficult  to  generalize  with  the  other  Spectre  castes 
about the role Oblivion claims in their existences. While some 
serve it willingly, others do their duty grudgingly or due to lack 
of alternatives, while still others embrace the madness and do 
the bidding of Oblivion out of a twisted form of love.

Becoming a Spectre

It  is  not  uncommon  for  a  wraith  to  become  corrupted 
by  her  Shadow  and  be  reborn  as  a  Spectre.  Incorporating  a 
Spectre player character into a Wraith chronicle can make for 
intriguing roleplaying opportunities, but a Spectre’s dark and 

destructive  nature  may  disrupt  some  chronicles  if  given  too 
much prominence. Balance, as always, is the key.

If a player is excited about the idea of turning her wraith 
character into a Spectre, she is encouraged to discuss it with the 
Storyteller. Conversely, the Storyteller may want to incorporate 
a Spectre into his chronicle. In that case, he should consider 
which of his players is best equipped to handle the roleplaying 
challenges that come with playing a servant of Oblivion.

Aside from making sure that both Storyteller and player 
are comfortable with the idea, the only other main factor is 
maintaining  story  balance  within  the  chronicle.  After  all, 
exploring a wraith’s corruption can give that character dis-
proportionate weight in the story. In order to keep the char-
acter from unbalancing the larger campaign, the Storyteller 
should incorporate story hooks that offer equal opportunities 
to other characters.

Next, the wraith’s Shadowguide must be informed of the 
direction  in  which  the  Storyteller  and  player  wish  to  take 
the  wraith  character.  The  Shadowguide  is  vital  to  helping 
the player roleplay her wraith’s transition, after all, since the 
Shadow’s influence over its alter ego is central to the descent 
into Oblivion’s service.
The Appeal of Evil

If your character will undergo transformation to a Spectre, 
the first thing you should do is look over your character — both 
the wraith and Shadow components. Look for reasons the wraith 
would fall — or be drawn — to ultimate corruption.

The most likely factors are found in the wraith’s Passions 
and the Shadow’s Dark Passions and Thorns; you may also find 
inspiration  from  “Shadow  Hooks,”  below.  Think  about  how 
the Shadow can not only twist the wraith’s powerful emotions 
against her, but also use the wraith’s hopes and dreams to feed 
the Shadow’s evil desires. These warped feelings are at the root 
of the individual Spectre’s motivations, and have their begin-
nings within the wraith’s own mind.

Next, work with the Storyteller to determine the motiva-
tions behind the transformation. Discuss the impact it will have 
on  the  character,  the  troupe,  and  the  chronicle  until  you’re 
both  satisfied  that  the  approach  is  sound  and  any  potential 
out-of-game conflicts are addressed.
Taking the Long View

A Spectre’s existence is short, as the anguish of Oblivion 
eventually overwhelms even the strongest of the Shadow-Eaten. 
The  most  successful  (and,  not  surprisingly,  most  dangerous) 
Spectres  are  those  who  endure  despite  their  self-destructive 
natures. A Spectre looking for more than an eye-blink exis-
tence must cultivate a higher — or lower, depending on how 
you look at it — purpose.

That in mind, think about what you hope to accomplish 
by having your character become a Spectre. While roleplaying 

SPECTRES

someone nasty has its benefits, look for more than that. There’s 
already ample opportunity for malice in guiding another charac-
ter’s Shadow without needing to convert a perfectly respectable 
wraith into a twisted parody of her former self.

Again, the best starting point is with the Shadow’s Dark Pas-
sions. Consider not only the core emotion but also its meaning. 
One like “Make others look foolish (Spite)” may be entertaining 
and surprisingly effective at fueling a Spectre’s Angst, but it 
won’t help maintain an existence for any appreciable length of 
time. Similarly, “Topple the Hierarchy (Hate)” provides a solid 
long-term goal, but one that is quite challenging to achieve. 
On the other hand, something strong but self-sustaining like 
“Spread pain (Malice)” or even “Withstand Oblivion (Fear)” 
can give your character a powerful incentive to stick around. 
And  more  specific  Dark  Passions  like  “Bring  my  friends  to 
Oblivion  (Envy)”  or  “Destroy  my  home  Necropolis  (Hate)” 
can provide a good chronicle focus.

With the Dark Passion as the first step, you should then 
develop at least a broad idea of what sort of trouble you see your 
Spectre getting into. This might tie neatly into the Storyteller’s 
current chronicle, build off of one of your wraith’s Fetters or 
Backgrounds, or head off on a previously unexplored tangent.
In  the  end,  look  for  a  motivation  beyond  the  obvious. 
Though driven by the pain and emptiness of Oblivion, Spectres 
can be just as complex as any wraith in their personalities, goals, 
and desires. Having a direction beyond basic destructive urges 
gives you a richer canvas upon which to work, and makes the 
experience more enjoyable for your fellow players.
Roleplaying the Descent

Once  you,  the  Shadowguide,  and  the  Storyteller  have 
worked out the basic idea, key hooks, and possible pitfalls, it’s 
finally time for the fun part: roleplaying your wraith’s descent 
into  Oblivion.  The  appearance  of  temptations  of  particular 
appeal to the wraith’s dark side, inspired cunning on the part 
of the Shadow, and valiant (though inevitably futile) resistance 
by the wraith — all these elements make the downward spiral 
dramatic and enjoyable for all.

The Storyteller is encouraged to weave this plot thread 
among the others that make up the chronicle already. Be careful 
not to direct too much attention toward the wraith’s temptation. 
Giving center stage to one wraith’s discussions with its Shadow 
is sure to irritate the other players, to say the least.

The Shadowguide should maintain the same attitude and 
involvement for the Shadow as in previous sessions. A dramatic 
increase in its whispered antics might draw undue player notice, 
and can disrupt the mood and pace of the game.

Likewise, the player should allow the corruption to occur 
naturally — or as naturally as such things will. If your wraith 
jumps all-too-gleefully into her Shadow’s waiting embrace, her 
fellow wraiths may well drag her off to a Pardoner before the 
desired takeover transpires.

For obvious reasons, it is recommended that the rest of 
the troupe be kept in the dark regarding the extent of their 
companion’s corruption. Keeping the players unaware of the 
change ensures that their characters’ actions and reactions are 
that much more authentic. Further, the less that others know 
about  the  plans,  the  more  everyone  will  enjoy  the  eventual 
corruption and transformation. If the other characters figure 
out what’s going on by themselves, that’s one thing and they 
should certainly encouraged to react appropriately. But there’s no 
reason to tip the player’s — or the Shadow’s — hand otherwise.

Dark Metamorphosis

Possibly  the  hardest  part  is  the  wraith’s  literal  transfor-
mation into a Spectre, and how to deal with the immediate 
consequences.  This  is  particularly  tricky  if  the  other  players 
are to remain unaware of the change.

The Shadowguide should alert the player and Storyteller 
when the Shadow is ready to take over the wraith permanently. 
At this point, some sleight of hand is called for.

The  Storyteller  should  set  up  circumstances  where  the 

wraith appears to fall into a Harrowing.

The character doesn’t have to suffer the actual event as 

long as it seems so to the other players.

Then, when the Shadow engulfs the wraith, she plunges 

into the Tempest for her “Harrowing.”

A fake Harrowing is then arranged for the troupe’s benefit. 
The specific Quarry and circumstances are irrelevant as long as 
it is believable to the troupe. Success or failure on the wraith’s 
part is also immaterial, although the player should roleplay the 
Harrowing as earnestly as any other.

At the Harrowing’s end, the Storyteller changes focus to 
the rest of the troupe, keeping them busy so that they don’t 
have the opportunity to check up on their vanished friend for 
some time. An ongoing plot works just fine; if nothing else, a 
sudden attack by Spectres should take care of it — and is quite 
likely, in fact, as the Shadow may have alerted them beforehand 
so that it can rejoin the Circle with no questions asked after 
the transformation is complete.

Transforming into a Spectre fundamentally 
changes what a wraith is, but it doesn’t mean 
starting  from  scratch.  At  Storyteller  discre-
tion,  the  new  Spectre  can  and  should  retain 
her memories and capabilities. That being said, 
there’s one exception — any points in the Ei-
dolon background are lost immediately. Other 
Backgrounds,  Abilities,  and  Fetters  that  the 
Storyteller and player agree are inappropriate for 
the fresh-hatched Spectre also go away. These 
lost things are not replaced with Freebie points; 
there’s a price to pay in the service of Oblivion, 
and this is one of the first tolls.

372

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

ALIBIS
Many things are suspect in a wraith’s exis-
tence, but a Spectre can use that to her advan-
tage. A newborn Spectre has a wealth of means 
to account for her temporary disappearance. In 
the end, whatever the alibi, simple is always best.

• Attacked by Hierarchy/Renegades/Her-
etics/Spectres/Plasmics: A constant danger for 
solitary wraiths. Such an attack might also account 
for any changes in the “wraith’s” appearance.

• Lost in the Tempest: Taking a shortcut to 
get back to her friends, the “wraith” got lost in 
the Tempest and only just found her way back.

•  Secret  Meeting  with  the  Guild:  The 
“wraith’s”  Guild  mentor/contact/ally/superior 
demanded she come to a meeting. They discussed 
things that she’s not at liberty to share (although 
if the troupe has a wraith in the same Guild, the 
“wraith” will be happy to take him aside later to 
bring him up to speed…).

It does take some time for a corrupted wraith to undergo the 
metamorphosis into a Spectre (see “Birth of a Spectre,” p. 344). 
Upon her return, the newly emerged Spectre should be prepared 
to face questions regarding the length of her disappearance, as 
well as explain any physical changes that may have occurred. 
Numerous complications and detours exist to delay travelers in 
the Underworld, but she would do well to have her story straight.
Keeping the Secret

After the transformation into a Spectre, maintaining the ruse 
of still being a wraith is not without its challenges. Certain Arcanoi 
are perfect for sniffing out the Shadow-Eaten, and Castigate in 
particular has been the bane of many a Doppelganger. Numerous 
Artifacts can also sense the presence of Oblivion. Avoiding such 
pitfalls can make for tense, exhilarating roleplaying.

As long as no one in the troupe can sense the Spectre, there 
is  no  need  to  make  special  concessions.  On  the  other  hand, 
having a Pardoner in the group ensures that a fledgling is likely 
to  enjoy  a  disappointingly  short  tenure.  The  Storyteller  may 
consider lending some assistance in the form of a minor Artifact 
that masks the user’s Spectral state for brief periods. Still, such 
aid isn’t mandatory. No one said being a Spectre should be easy.

My Shadow Did What?

trol. Perhaps you relied overmuch on Shadow Dice, or entered 
into a Pact of Doom too often, or maybe your Shadow’s Dark 
Passions were just particularly effective at gleaning Angst.

Whatever  the  reason,  there  are  instances  when  your 
character becomes a Spectre before you or your Storyteller was 
prepared for it to happen. This doesn’t mean the character is 
written off. Instead, an inspired event like this can open whole 
new doors of plot and roleplaying.

Once the Shadow’s Angst rating reaches 10, your wraith 
plunges into the Tempest to begin the metamorphosis into a 
Spectre. The Storyteller should take a short break and discuss 
with  you  the  ramifications  of  this  change.  The  steps  listed 
previously  for  premeditated  Spectre  transformation  provide 
a  useful  guide  to  this  conversation.  As  long  as  you  wish  to 
continue  playing  the  character  and  the  Storyteller  feels  the 
transformation won’t disrupt the chronicle, there’s no reason 
to change characters.

Creating a Spectre

or  the  most  part,  character  creation  for 
a  Spectre  is  the  same  as  for  a  wraith 
(see  Chapter  Four:  Character).  The 
information  that  follows  points  out  any 
differences  and  additions  that  Spectres 
have.  As  when  creating  a  wraith,  this 
process  assumes  your  character  is  a 
relatively inexperienced Spectre only recently claimed by 
Oblivion. At the Storyteller’s discretion, your character may 
be  new  to  death  or  have  existed  as  a  wraith  for  centuries 
before being devoured by his Shadow.

Step One: Concept

When thinking about the three initial questions covered 
on p. 107 — Who were you? How did you die? Why are you still 
here?  —  consider  how  they  differ  for  Spectres.  While  your 
character’s  cause  of  death  may  inform  aspects  of  his  back-
ground, it is more relevant to determine how your character 
was devoured by Oblivion. Did it claim you at the moment 
of  death  or  was  it  a  slow  and  torturous  battle  against  your 
Shadow? Were you lost in the Tempest, captured by a Malfean, 
or swallowed by a Maelstrom?
Nature and Demeanor

Select Nature and Demeanor in the same way as with a 

wraith (p. 114).
Caste

Or, When Bad Things Happen to Good Wraiths
Sometimes,  despite  your  best  intentions,  your  wraith’s 
Shadow grows increasingly powerful and gains permanent con-

The manner in which you were claimed by Oblivion also 
establishes the caste to which you belong. Each Spectre caste 
has unique abilities and weaknesses, outlined below.

SPECTRES

373

Mortwights

This group is comprised of mortals who were claimed by 
Oblivion at the instant of their death. Not an official caste as 
Spectres consider such things, Mortwights default to the lowest 
status of Spectral society despite their skill in battle.
•  Arcanoi: A Mortwight character has access only to Dark 
Arcanoi and gains Tempest Weaving 1 automatically. You 
may distribute an additional 5 dots as you choose.

•  Weeping Wound: A Mortwight’s death wound seeps Corpus 
constantly. This is replenished instantly while you are in 
the Labyrinth and the Tempest. However, you automati-
cally suffer 2 lethal Corpus levels of damage per day while 
outside of these regions. This damage cannot be soaked.

Striplings

While also not a formal caste, this group of literal child 
Spectres  largely  disdains  such  official  conventions.  Not  all 
Spectral children are Striplings, but all Striplings are children. 
If you choose this group, you must also determine the formal 
caste to which you belong (or whether you are a Mortwight). 
However, apply the details listed below instead of those noted 
for the caste selected.
•  Arcanoi:  A  Stripling  character  has  access  to  all  wraith 
Arcanoi, as well as Dark Arcanoi. You gain Shroud Rend-
ing 1 automatically and may distribute an additional 7 dots 
as you choose.

•  Child  Form:  As  a  Stripling,  you  suffer  the  restrictions 
of being a child, including being limited to 6 primary, 4 
secondary, and 2 tertiary points to distribute among your 
Attributes (p. 111). 

Likewise, you have only 8 points to spend on Dark Passions. 
You may have Fetters, depending on what caste you selected.
Doppelgangers

Former wraiths who have been devoured by their Shadow, 
Doppelgangers are the rank and file troops of Oblivion. As the 
most  “wraith-like”  of  Spectres,  Doppelgangers  are  uniquely 
suited  to  infiltrating  wraith  society.  Members  of  this  group 
barely edge out Mortwights in respect among the other castes.
•  Arcanoi:  A  Doppelganger  character  has  access  to  all 
Arcanoi and Dark Arcanoi, and you may allocate 6 dots 
among them as you choose.

•  Dark Reflection: A Doppelganger shares certain similarities 
with wraiths. Most notably, you spend the same amount 
of points during character creation (aside from Arcanoi) 
and you retain Fetters, which allow you to remain in the 
Shadowlands.

Nephwracks

These are former Doppelgangers whose Corpus is so physi-
cally warped that they may no longer conceal the ravages of 

Oblivion. Nephwracks consider this a sign of Oblivion’s bless-
ing. Members of this caste take the roles of artists, priests, and 
public servants among Spectre society.
•  Arcanoi: A Nephwrack character has access to all Arcanoi, 
as well as Dark Arcanoi. You may distribute 8 dots among 
them as you choose.

•  Unfettered:  As  a  Nephwrack  you  are  scarcely  different 
from  a  Doppelganger  (a  point  of  contention  at  times). 
The main distinction is your twisted physical appearance, 
which it is impossible to disguise even with Moliate. Also, 
you have no Fetters.

Shades

The personification of Dark Passion, Shades are former 
wraiths  devoured  by  Oblivion  when  lost  in  the  Tempest, 
while caught in a Maelstrom, or during a Harrowing. They 
are the shock troops of Spectral society and are second only 
to Malfeans in status.
•  Arcanoi: A Shade character has access only to Dark Ar-
canoi. You may allocate 5 dots among them as you choose.
•  Shadecraft: The unique nature of a Shade’s creation unlocks 
unique abilities. First, you get 12 points to divide among your 
Dark Passions. Next, you have access to unique Shadecraft 
abilities (p. 358). You gain one for free to start, but may 
purchase more with freebie points (5 points for each Art) 
or later with experience (7 points for each power).

Malfeans

As beings of stupendous power and alien nature, Malfeans 
are not recommended as player characters. The  Storyteller 
should  consider  thoroughly  the  ramifications  of  allowing  a 
player to take on the challenge.

More likely, the Storyteller may need to craft a Malfean 
for  her  own  purposes.  In  such  circumstances,  use  the  same 
process as with a starting character, then apply the following 
modifications below.
•  Arcanoi: A Malfean has access to all Arcanoi and Dark 
Arcanoi except for those that deal exclusively with the 
Skinlands; you may allocate 12 dots among them as you 
choose.

•  Malfean Nature: Each Malfean has Willpower 10; aside 
from  this,  the  full  range  of  its  powers  depends  on  the 
concept you develop. As a rule of thumb, a Malfean has 
access to all Shadow Thorns and Shadecraft arts. Further, 
it can siphon from servitors any Pathos or Angst needed 
to  utilize  any  powers.  Spend  between  1000  and  1500 
experience  points  to  increase  Traits  and  amass  powers 
according to the concept you develop. Bear in mind that 
it can be quite expensive to raise a Trait that is already 
advanced. See p. 377 for more information on spending 
experience points.

and modify by any caste restrictions listed above.

Step Two: Attributes

Step Three: Abilities

Step Four: Advantages
Arcanoi and Dark Arcanoi

As  noted  above,  your  caste  determines  which  Arcanoi 
you have access to, and the number of dots you may spend on 
them. Not all Spectres have access to wraith Arcanoi, but Dark 
Arcanoi are unrestricted. Refer to p. 147 for complete Arcanoi 
listings, and to p. 349 for Dark Arcanoi listings.
•  Hive Mind: In addition to the dots you may allocate based 
on your caste, all Spectres begin the game with Collogue 1.
•  Botching  Arcanoi:  If  you  botch  when  using  a  regular 
Arcanos power, your Psyche gains Pathos (instead of the 
Shadow gaining Angst) where applicable.

Backgrounds

A Spectre character has access to the same Backgrounds 
as wraiths, with the following exceptions: A Spectre may not 
possess Eidolon or Notoriety; in turn, a spectre may take the 
Shadowlands or Labyrinth Backgrounds (see sidebar). The Sto-
ryteller may choose to restrict or even deny other Backgrounds 
depending on the nature of the chronicle.

You get 5 dots to distribute among your Spectre character’s 

chosen Backgrounds.
Dark Passions

As noted previously, Spectres are motivated by their Dark 
Passions. The total points in Dark Passions also determine a 
Spectre’s place within his Spectral caste.

You  receive  10  dots  to  distribute  among  Dark  Passions, 
modified by caste as noted above. You may adjust them further 
with freebie points.

Most significant Dark Passions include Hate, Greed, Mal-
ice, Envy, Lust, Bitterness, and Jealousy. Each is expressed as a 
sentence detailing the passion’s meaning, followed by one word 
that sums up the particular passion involved — for instance, 
“Destroy the Hierarchy (Hate)” or “Advance the decay of the 
Edinburgh Necropolis (Envy).” Dark Passions should be broad 
enough to be widely applicable, but specific enough that they 
have a direct focus. 

Think about your Nature and Demeanor when determin-
ing your Dark Passions. Dark Passions are also often directed 
at former Fetters the Spectre held as a wraith.

Fetters

Only  Mortwights  and  Doppelgangers  have  Fetters.  A 
Spectre’s  Fetters  often  relate  to  painful  moments  in  his  life. 
The site of his death is a common one, but others may exist — 
the hospital delivery room where his wife died in childbirth, 
the liquor store where he bought the booze he later used to 
drink himself to death, and so on. A Spectre’s Fetter cannot 
be resolved, but it can be destroyed.

If your character has Fetters, choose them in the same way 

described on p. 114.

SPECTRES

375

Step Five: Finishing Touches
Angst

Angst is a measure of the dark emotional energy that all 
Spectres possess. Your Angst is measured in a pool of individual 
points from a scale of 0 to 10. Only in exceedingly rare circum-
stances can your Angst pool exceed 10 points.

The pool total fluctuates during a chronicle as you spend 
and regain Angst. Unless noted otherwise, Angst points function 
exactly like a wraith’s Pathos points (p. 114): You use Angst to 
power Arcanoi, regain it through your Dark Passions, and may 
spend it to recover Corpus.

You  start  with  5  dots  in  Angst,  and  may  increase  this 
amount using freebie points. However, your Angst score can-
not exceed 10 points.
Willpower

Willpower  determines  a  Spectre’s  emotional  essence, 
spiritual strength, and self-control. In game terms, it functions 
the same way as with wraiths. A Spectre starts with 5 dots in 
permanent Willpower. You can use freebie points to increase 
this to a maximum of 10.

Corpus

A Spectre’s body is made of the same otherworldly stuff as 
is a wraith’s, and can be manipulated and harmed in the same 
way. It’s common for Spectres to alter the appearance of their 
Corpus, sometimes in dramatic fashion. Often Oblivion does 
the job for them, twisting and decaying Spectres into mockeries 
of the human form.

You start with 10 Corpus, and may spend Angst points to 
heal any injuries in the same way that a wraith spends Pathos. 
A Spectre also heals damage through Slumber; however, Slum-
bering Spectres don’t sleep inside a Fetter. Instead, they return 
to the Labyrinth and fade into its walls for eight hours. See 
Injury and Healing on p. 295 for details on recovering Corpus.
Remember  that  the  constant  scouring  of  Oblivion  can 
reduce a Spectre’s Corpus total, as expressed through botches 
(see “Brief Life,” p. 348). Corpus lost in this manner cannot be 
restored by spending Angst nor through Slumber.

Unlike wraiths, when a Spectre’s Corpus level falls to zero, 
she ceases to exist. Her fragmented essence is sucked into the 
Void through a Nihil, never to return.

376

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

SUCCUMBING TO THE VOID

When  a  Spectre  finally  falls  to  Oblivion 
(e.g., when damage or botching reduces a Spectre 
character below 1 Corpus), he is dragged at last 
into the Void. A Nihil forms around the destroyed 
Spectre, and anyone in the vicinity must succeed 
at standard Dexterity + Athletics rolls to escape 
its pull. Alternately, characters may use Argos, 
Tempest Weaving, or other appropriate Arcanoi 
(at Storyteller discretion) to get clear. Those who 
fail to escape are pulled into the Labyrinth — to 
the very edge of the Void itself, where the rem-
nants of the destroyed Spectre’s soul are drawn.

Freebie Points

You have 20 freebie points to spend on rounding out your 
Traits. This functions the same as with a wraith character, in-
cluding being able to gain up to 7 additional freebie points by 
giving your Psyche a larger freebie pool on a one-for-one basis. 
However, unlike a wraith, you cannot spend freebie points to 
reduce your Psyche’s pool.

Don’t forget to make note of the characteristics that all 

With your character’s Traits established, you can finalize 

•  Appearance:  A  Spectre’s  caste  has  a  major  influence 
on appearance. As noted before, Doppelgangers look most like 
wraiths, including choosing to have the semblance of clothing. 
Most Spectres of other castes go naked to display their Oblivion 
twisted forms to best effect. Regardless of caste, many Moliate 
their appearance in some signature fashion. Spectres can be 
quite imaginative, if grotesque, in expressing their individuality. 
Consider your character along similar lines. Does he display his 
flayed form with pride, or is he bedecked in a suit that covers 

most of his mottled deathmarks? Has he Moliated his eyes into 
bug-like stalks, or his hair into a nest of thorns?

• Idiosyncrasies: Appearance aside, it’s the little things 
— quirks and bits of business — that make a character unique. 
These details make your character memorable. Does he sing 
half-remembered pop hits, mangling the lyrics? Does he only 
hunt wraiths who remind him of his father? Does he insist on 
referring to himself in the third person? Does he claw at his face 
when stressed, leaving oozing gouges in the Corpus?

• Psyche: The Psyche is the last shred of your soul that 
defies Oblivion. It functions much like a wraith’s Shadow, and 
so should be designed in collaboration with the Storyteller.

SPECTRE EXPERIENCE
Since Spectres have brief-yet-intense exis-
tences, the Storyteller may reward more experi-
ence points than wraith characters usually receive. 
This allows for growth and development within 
the  limited  framework  of  a  Spectre  chronicle. 
Apply the same approach to awarding experience 
points as described under “Character Develop-
ment” (p. 310), with the following adjustments:
End of Story Experience

If  the  Storyteller  awards  extra  experience 
at the end of a story in a Spectre chronicle, the 
character gets 2 points (instead of 1) for each 
category — success, danger, wisdom (or any other 
relevant categories) — in which the Storyteller 
declares an award. Additionally, the Storyteller 
may award 1 point of experience if a character 
furthered  the  cause  of  Oblivion,  especially  at 
some cost to herself.
Spending Experience

Some costs for raising a spectre’s Traits or 
purchasing new ones differ from those required 
for wraiths.

The Psyche

ust as a Shadow is that dark corner of the 
soul within a wraith, the Psyche is the last 
remnant of anything kind or good within a 
Spectre. The Psyche is an everpresent voice, 
a guilty conscience that reminds the Spectre 
how kind and good she was before Oblivion 
corrupted her. Most times the Psyche is weak, 
its voice thin and sickly. However, some actions a Spectre takes, 
including employing Larceny or other high-level Dark Arcanos 
arts, can help the Psyche to gain strength.

In  Wraith,  the  Psyche  functions  in  the  same  way  as  a 
Shadow, and should be played similarly. But while the Shadow 
can give a wraith an occasional bad day, the Psyche walks a much 
finer line with the Spectre. The higher urgings that a Psyche 
espouses are seen as weakness, and may get the Psyche — and 
its host — turned to ectoplasmic goo. As such, the wise Psyche 
grades the road to Redemption in an almost imperceptible rise.
Psycheguide

As with wraith and Shadow, players in a Spectre chronicle 
take on two parts: their own Spectre characters and another 
character’s Psyche. Unlike the Shadow, the Psyche does not 
resort  to  cruel  tricks  to  win  over  the  character.  Rather,  the 
Psyche employs deserved praise, produces happy memories of 

REDEMPTION VS. REDEMPTION

The  idea  of  redemption  for  a  Spectre  is 
a  complicated  one.  Most  understand,  if  don’t 
necessarily  agree,  with  the  idea  of  how  doing 
some good might palliate some of the evil they’ve 
done,  and  why  that  might  or  might  not  be  a 
desirable thing. (No Spectre not under the con-
trol of their Psyche thinks it is a good thing, for 
example.) However, the notion of Redemption 
as a singular concept, the act by which Spectres 
are  metaphysically  washed  clean  of  their  sins 
and thus rescued from the clutches of Oblivion 
is a tricky one. Certain Stygian sects believe in 
it wholeheartedly, to the point where they will 
deliberately attempt to capture Spectres in order 
to try to work this miracle upon them. And even 
among the Shadow-Eaten there are those who 
doubt Oblivion and who believe there is a way 
out of their hellish existence, whether they (or 
their Psyches) want it or not. But just because 
they believe it exists doesn’t mean they’d pursue 
it — it might mean that they’re on the lookout 
for anyone else who does.

the Spectre’s mortal or wraith past, and otherwise tries to guide 
the Spectre with kindness and love.

On the rare occasions when the Psyche is dominant, the 

Spectre’s player takes over the role, not the Psycheguide.

Psyche Character Creation

The Psyche is developed after all other stages of character 
generation. The Storyteller manages much of this process him-
self. While the Psyche is part of the Spectre character, details 
should be kept as secret as possible so that the player remains 
generally unaware of the heights of redemption to which the 
Psyche aspires. That said, the Storyteller should work with the 
player to understand the Spectre character she wants to play, 
so  that  the  Psyche  is  not  totally  at  odds  with  this  concept. 
The Psyche is an integral part of a Spectre, after all, not some 
separate entity, and should be designed with due care.

If a player feels that she should create the Psyche, simply 
discuss the option with the Storyteller. There is no functional 
difference  within  the  chronicle,  of  course;  however,  it  does 
remove possible surprises that the Psyche might employ. Even 
so, having the player generate her character’s Psyche ensures 
that it is consistent with the Spectre character’s concept.
Step One: Archetype

Select a Psyche archetype from the list below. This rep-
resents the Psyche’s general personality, but should also mesh 
well  with  the  Spectre  character’s  Nature.  As  with  wraiths’ 
Shadows, these are simply the most common archetypes; the 
Storyteller is free to modify one or create a more suitable one 
for the Spectre in question.

• Agent: This Psyche is always looking out for your best 
interests, seeking to find something constructive and positive 
for you to do. It wants to guide you and generally help you better 
yourself. And if the Psyche profits along the way, so much the 
better! Constructive criticism plays a major part in the Agent’s 
repertoire; it helps you look at your performances and learn 
from your mistakes. If there is anything you need, your Psyche 
will promise to get it for you, so that you can get on with the 
important business of redemption. Remember, the Agent does 
it all for you, and genuinely expects nothing in return.

• Comrade:  This Psyche is the shoulder to cry on, the 
friendly smile on a bad day. It’s always ready to lend a hand or 
help you through a rough patch. Like any old friend, the Comrade 
knows you intimately, and accepts the bad along with the good. 
This Psyche always seeks to defend your reputation. Perhaps 
the Comrade is puzzled or hurt as to why you’re behaving so 
maliciously. It may blame itself, or be insecure and thus cling 
to you, whom it admires unabashedly. By comparing your noble 
past to your present activities, and by showing that it supports 
you without judgment, the Comrade also strives to help you 
realize that you were once a kinder, nobler soul.

• Confessor: Stern but kindly, this Psyche’s gruff exterior 
hides a fount of love and compassion. Although affronted by 

378

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

the sins it witnesses, the Confessor would never think of reveal-
ing them to others. There is a bit of the martyr in this Psyche, 
though this doesn’t stop it from confronting you with evidence 
of your sins, seeking to sway you toward penance. As far as the 
Confessor is concerned, judicious applications of guilt are all 
part of the road to redemption, and it feels no qualms about 
lecturing you. After all, such measures are good for your soul.
•  Counselor:  This  Psyche  is  the  person  you  can  tell 
anything, that part of you prepared to listen to your problems 
without judging or berating you. The Counselor’s role is to help 
you realize where your problems lie, and help you work out strat-
egies to deal with them. This Psyche listens, asks open-ended 
questions, and offers observations designed to help you recognize 
and define your own weaknesses and faults. Rather than ignoring 
any problems, the Counselor wants to help you make them go 
away. This Psyche presents itself as emotionally removed from 
you, with no personal bias regarding your existence.

•  Nurturer:  This  Psyche  is  maternal,  supportive,  and 
caring. It is concerned about the kind of Spectres you hang 
around with, and considers them a bad influence. Although 
the Nurturer may scold, it never loses its temper. It wants you 
to be safe, warm, and happy, and does its best to ensure that you 
are — regardless of whether you want these things or not. This 
Psyche has almost infinite patience, and cannot be intimidated 
or beaten down. The Nurturer knows what’s best for you, and 
is determined that you shall have it.

•  Saint:  Proud,  commanding,  and  authoritative,  this 
Psyche stands out as an incorruptible beacon of purity within 
your soul. The Saint knows that evil exists, but has no time 
for it. It has no compunctions about torturing you with bold 
and unforgiving comparisons between you and its own stalwart 
demeanor. This Psyche’s tone is matter of fact. It knows your 
sins and chastises you for them. Few Spectres are strong enough 
to stand up to this Psyche.

• Savior: This Psyche is the way and light, the road to 
salvation. Preaching to you constantly, the Savior wants you 
to listen only to it. No other can lead you to redemption. This 
Psyche is self-sacrificing, prepared to suffer any harm should 
that advance your redemption in some way. The Savior is both 
preacher and friend, and wants most of all to have you as an 
equal  —  understanding  and  infinitely  forgiving.  When  this 
Psyche dominates, it loves to take the opportunity to debate 
and deliver sermons to anyone around. It advises forgiveness 
for you to any who will listen.
Step Two: Pathos

Just as Angst powers the Shadow, Pathos fuels the Psyche. 
This Trait represents the degree of serenity, peace, and compas-
sion that the Psyche possesses. Pathos has both a permanent 
rating or score (indicated in dots) and a temporary pool of points 
(indicated  in  squares).  The  rating  represents  the  degree  of 
control the Psyche has over the Spectre character, and is used 
for any rolls or tests. The points function just like a Spectre’s 

Angst pool, and are spent to accomplish relevant tasks, activate 
Fronds, and the like.

The Pathos rating only changes by spending experience to 
increase it, or through specific Arcanos and Dark Arcanos arts 
that can raise or lower the score permanently. The Pathos pool 
fluctuates as the Psyche spends points and gains them through 
the Spectre’s actions.

The Pathos pool can, and often does, exceed the permanent 
score, typically as a result of the Spectre’s actions, through use 
of certain Dark Arcanoi, and by fulfilling the Psyche’s Passions. 
If the total Pathos points exceed the Spectre’s Willpower score, 
the Psyche can attempt to assert control over the Spectre. If 
the Pathos pool ever reaches 10 points, the Psyche can trade 
them all in to increase its Pathos rating by 1. This not only 
makes the Psyche stronger, it also brings the Spectre that much 
closer to Redemption.

It is recommended that the Spectre player never know how 
strong her Psyche’s Pathos rating is — and thus how close (or 
how far) she is from being Redeemed.

To determine the Psyche’s starting Pathos, make a standard 
Willpower roll using the Spectre’s Willpower rating. The number 
of  successes  is  the  Psyche’s  Pathos  rating  and  corresponding 
Pathos pool at the start of the game.
Step Three: Passions

Just  as  with  a  wraith,  Passions  are  concerned  with  the 
Psyche’s higher morals and drives and can include Love, Honesty, 
Sincerity, Hope, and Faith. Likewise, fulfilling a Passion allows 
the Psyche to increase its Pathos pool. See “Passions” (p. 304) 
for options to choose from and details on how they are utilized.
Bear in mind that a Psyche’s Passions should reflect the 
Spectre’s  Dark  Passions.  Much  of  the  drama  inherent  in  a 
Spectre chronicle is drawn from the clash of goals between a 
Spectre and her Psyche.

Assign 7 points to the Psyche’s Passions. Freebie points can 
increase them further in the final stage of the Psyche’s design.
Step Four: Finishing Touches

In this stage, you apply any final adjustments to the Psyche 
by  spending  freebie  points.  You  can  increase  its  Pathos  and 
Passions, and determine its powers, known as Fronds (see the 
next section for details).

The Psyche’s Pathos rating cannot be bought higher than 
the Spectre’s Willpower score, although you may purchase ad-
ditional points for the Pathos pool.

Fronds

A Psyche’s Fronds are the equivalent of the Shadow’s Thorns 
(p. 231). The Psycheguide uses these unique gifts to harry the 
Spectre. Ideally, the Spectre’s player should be in the dark as to 
which Fronds the Psyche has until they manifest in the game.
Allies (1 point/level)

The Psyche communes regularly with wraiths in the area. 
This Frond is the equivalent of the Allies Background, though 
applicable only to wraiths associated with the locale.
Inspiration (1 point/level, up to 5)

This Frond functions the same as the Infamy Thorn (p. 
231),  except  that  it  measures  the  amount  of  hope,  courage, 
kindness, or other positive quality that the Spectre’s memory 
still inspires in the living. Every time the Spectre with this Frond 
falls into Slumber, the Psycheguide makes a standard roll using 
a number of dice equal to this Frond’s level. Each success gives 
the Psyche 1 Pathos point.
Memories of Life (1 point)

The Psyche remembers all that the Spectre has forgotten 
about her former existence (as a mortal or a wraith). With the 
Spectre’s agreement, the Psyche can provide the Spectre with 
any information or knowledge from that life. This can include 
forgotten skills, tidbits of information, or other nuggets that may 
come in handy to a Spectre struggling to remember something 
vital. If the Spectre accepts this aid, the flashes of memory as-
sociated with that worthier former existence trigger a Willpower 
roll. On a successful roll, the Spectre is discomfited but otherwise 
none the worse for wear. On a failed roll, the Spectre loses a 
number of Angst points equal to the Psyche’s strongest Passion. 
On a botch, the Spectre loses double that amount.
Mirror (1 point)

The Psyche spends 3 Pathos to activate this Frond, which 
reveals, in every flat surface that the Spectre sees, an image of 
what the Spectre once looked like, or the most horrific aspects 
of her persona made manifest. Seeing what might have been, 
or the unvarnished truth of her current state, is troubling even 
to Spectres.

When confronted with this horrifying visage, the Spectre 
rolls Willpower in a resisted action against the Psyche’s Pathos. 
If successful, the Spectre is subject to a +1 difficulty on any 
Charisma-related action for the next turn as she pulls herself 
together; if failed, the Spectre is wracked by self-loathing and 
unable to act except in self-defense for the remainder of the scene.
Psyche Sigil (1–3 points)

Similar  to  the  Death’s  Sigil  Thorn  (p.  231),  this  Frond 
is a manifestation of the possible redemption that the Psyche 
represents. This sign is cheerful or uplifting in nature — the 
scent of roses or baking bread, the echoing song of a choir or 

a  child’s  laugh,  or  some  other  sensory  trigger  —  and  lingers 
wherever the Spectre is present. The manifestation is subtle 
but  noticeable,  with  all  the  corresponding  advantages  and 
disadvantages this offers. The number of points in this Frond 
indicates the sigil’s strength. A 1-point sigil might impact the 
Spectre’s efforts at intimidation or stealth, while a 3-point sigil 
could alter the effects of her Dark Arcanoi.

The Spectre can spend 1 Willpower to suppress the Frond’s 

effects for a scene.
Pure Relic (1 point/level)

This Frond functions the same as the Tainted Relic Thorn 
(p. 231), except that the relic is tied to the Psyche and has some 
significance to the Spectre’s previous existence.
Psyche Trait (2 points)

At the Spectre’s request, the Psyche can grant her 1 ad-
ditional dot to a specific Attribute or Ability for the remainder 
of the scene. The specific Trait must be decided when this Frond 
is purchased. The Psyche gains 1 Pathos point each time the 
Spectre draws upon this extra dot.

This Frond can be purchased multiple times, with each 

enhancing a different Trait.
Guilt (3 points)

The Psyche spends 1 Pathos to activate this Frond, which 
subjects the Spectre to tremendous guilt about a recent action. 
The Spectre rolls Willpower in a resisted action against the 
Psyche’s current Pathos. If successful, the Spectre is subject to 
a +1 difficulty to all actions for the next turn as she pulls herself 
together. If failed, the Spectre suffers an agony of guilt and loses 
1 Willpower point for each extra success that the Psyche rolled.
Indulgence (3 points)

Similar to the Pact of Doom Thorn (p. 232), this Frond rep-
resents a deal between the Spectre and her Psyche. In exchange 
for being unhindered by her Psyche in some imminent action, 
the Spectre agrees to grant it Pathos points. The Spectre can 
offer between 1 and 5 points, with the Psyche making counter 
offers until both sides either accept the terms or break off ne-
gotiation. Once an agreement is reached, the Psyche receives 
that number of Pathos points and must not interfere with the 
impending action in any way, even to berate or comment.
Freudian Slip (4 points)

This is identical to the Thorn of the same name (p. 233). 
However, the Spectre needs only 1 success to resist the effect.
Heavenly Light (5 points)

By spending a point of Pathos, the Psyche can illuminate 
the Spectre in a beam of white light that appears to come from 
above. This can be awkward, especially in an audience with a 
Malfean or while attempting to set an ambush, but the Psyche 

380

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

must also be careful not to use it under circumstances that might 
get the Spectre killed. The effect lasts one scene per point spent.
Penance (6 points)

The Psyche can intercede when the Spectre might otherwise 
lose Corpus to Oblivion (through a botch or other means). If 
the Spectre accepts, the Psyche negates the Corpus loss, then 
prescribes a penance that the Spectre must enact at her earliest 
opportunity. The Psyche need not reveal what the act is until 
after the Spectre accepts. The penance is typically some kind-
ness or worthy deed and should not take more than a scene or 
two to perform.
Secret Life (7 points)

Similar to the Shadow Life Thorn (p. 233), this Frond al-
lows the Psyche to take control of the Spectre’s Corpus while 
she Slumbers. The Spectre remains unaware of anything the 
Psyche does during this time. Since the Psyche is pursuing an 
independent existence, the Spectre may find herself burdened 
with  responsibilities,  allies,  and  enemies  she  does  not  recall 
making, or even falling into traps the Psyche devised for her.

Guiding the Psyche

Playing the Psyche in a Spectre chronicle is just as impor-
tant as playing the Shadow is in a traditional Wraith chronicle. 
While the Psyche is a secondary character for the Psycheguide, 
it should be played with the same care and dedication that the 
player brings to her own Spectre character.

The Psycheguide must keep track of the Psyche’s Pathos 
and the Spectre host’s Willpower. They must also have a good 
understanding of the personality, goals, and history of the Spectre 
they’re guiding, so that you can more accurately portray the 
Spectre’s suppressed higher urges. An all-out stampede towards 
goodness and mercy, regardless of the character’s personality, is 
missing the point. The Psyche is a part of the Spectre’s person-
ality just as the Shadow is a part of a wraith’s, and it operates 
within that personality’s framework.

Ultimately, the Psyche is the sole fragment of goodness that 
survives within the Spectre. Even if the character was cruel and 
malicious in life, she still had some aspects that strove toward 
the good and true. The Psyche is the last embodiment of these 
qualities, a tiny beacon of light within the Spectre’s dark soul. 
Guiding such evil toward redemption is a herculean challenge, 

SPECTRES

381

but it is matched by the indomitable will of the Psyche in its 
all-out struggle for survival.
Psychic Healing

The Psyche battles to save the Spectre’s soul, but the tools 
it uses are dramatically different from the abuse, deceit, cruelty, 
and brutality that Shadows use to corrupt wraiths. Instead, the 
Psyche seeks to bring light to the darkness of the Spectre’s exis-
tence through kind words and pleasant memories. The path to 
redemption is a difficult one, requiring a delicate hand so that 
healing doesn’t become nagging that drives the Spectre back 
down to depravity and ruin. Additionally, the Psyche knows 
well that it too is doomed if the Spectre falls to the Void, which 
lends an undercurrent of desperation to the struggle.
Acquiring Pathos

Pathos represents the power of redemption that lies within 
the Psyche. The more Pathos it possesses, the stronger the Psyche 
grows, until it can attempt to gain control of the Spectre and 
steer her more directly toward the light — or at least keep the 
Spectre from damning herself any further.

The Psyche’s ultimate goal is Redemption, so it will le-
verage circumstances to put the Spectre in situations where 
she must rely on the Psyche for help. In this way, the Psyche 
gains Pathos, growing stronger and influencing the Spectre to 
a greater and greater degree. This is, of course, done only for 
the Spectre’s benefit, and should never be confused with the 
sort of manipulation done by a wraith’s Shadow.

From a systems standpoint, the Psyche acquires Pathos in 
a manner almost identical to how Shadows gain Angst (see p. 
235). Any distinctions are outlined below.

• Arcanoi: The Psyche can gain Pathos points when certain 
Dark Arcanos arts are used; see individual listings for specifics. 
For Arcanos arts, if a botch would grant Angst to the Shadow, 
it instead grants Pathos to the Psyche.

The only exception is during Cartharsis; see “Arcanos Use 

During Catharsis,” below.

• Psyche Dice: When the Spectre needs to roll for a task, 
the Psyche can offer extra dice for the attempt. The Psyche can 
offer a number of dice equal to its Pathos rating. Any Psyche 
Dice used are considered part of the Spectre’s own dice pool for 
determining success, but the actual dice are rolled separately to 
help keep track of results (the Storyteller may even have the 
Psycheguide roll the Psyche Dice). Any 1s rolled on the Psyche 
Dice grant the Psyche that number of Pathos points.

Additionally,  if  the  roll  results  in  a  botch,  the  Spectre 
does not lose 1 permanent Corpus level (“Brief Life,” p. 348). 
This  represents  the  Psyche’s  beneficent  influence,  and  gives 
the Psyche additional leverage in guiding the Spectre along 
the path to the light.

• Psyche Passions: The Psyche can gain Pathos for fulfill-
ing its Passions. Make a standard roll based on the appropriate 
passion whenever the Psyche accomplishes that Passion’s goal. 

Each  success  awards  1  Pathos  point.  As  with  Shadows,  the 
Psyche may also roll (difficulty 9) to gain Pathos points if it 
encourages someone else to indulge in an emotion that powers 
one of the Psyche’s Passions.

•  Roleplaying:  A  scene  in  which  a  Spectre  confronts 
doubts, fears, or external issues that impact the Psyche’s efforts 
at redemption may warrant an award of 1 Pathos point, at the 
Storyteller’s discretion and if the player agrees. Since this oc-
curs as a result of roleplaying rather than through established 
systems, it is important that the decision be mutual.
Losing Pathos

As with gaining Pathos, the methods of losing it are con-
sistent with how a Shadow loses Angst. Any distinctions are 
outlined below.

• Arcanoi Use During Catharsis: When the Psyche uses 
Arcanoi or Dark Arcanoi while controlling the Spectre, any 
Pathos that might normally be gained is instead deducted from 
the Psyche’s current Pathos pool.

• Botching During Catharsis: A botch on any roll the 
Psyche makes while dominating the Spectre in Cartharsis does 
not  result  in  the  Spectre  losing  1  permanent  Corpus  level. 

REDEMPTION

No  one  knows  what  Redemption  really 
means, or if it’s even possible. Stories of Spectres 
who achieve Redemption and vanish instantly 
from the Labyrinth make the rounds, but they’re 
always  secondhand.  Some  say  the  vanished 
Spectres are reborn as wraiths and must trudge 
through existence in the Shadowlands chasing 
Transcendence.  Others  claim  Redemption  is 
actually a shortcut to Transcendence itself. Still 
others suggest that the soul is reborn as a mortal, 
given a new chance at life. Then there are those 
who mutter that it’s all a scam, that the Psyche 
is  simply  another  lure  of  Oblivion,  and  that 
Redemption is another word for the Void.

From a systems standpoint, a Spectre achieves 
Redemption if her Psyche attains a 10 permanent 
Pathos rating. What happens after is up to the 
Storyteller. Regardless, Redemption is a truly mo-
mentous event. The Storyteller should check each 
character’s Pathos rating regularly to stay abreast 
of the Psyche’s progress. Should a Psyche appear 
to be approaching the lofty goal of a maximum 
permanent  Pathos  score,  the  Storyteller  may 
consider  adjusting  the  course  of  the  chronicle 
to address the possibility of Redemption — and 
what  steps  the  Spectre’s  fellow  Shadow-Eaten 
might take to prevent it.

382

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Instead, the Psyche loses 1 Pathos point. This represents the 
Psyche’s control slipping, however briefly.

• Frond Use: Some Fronds require Pathos expenditure 

to activate.

•  Roleplaying:  If  a  Spectre  makes  a  serious  effort  to 
weaken her Psyche, the Storyteller may decide that losing 1 or 
2 Pathos points is appropriate. This reward should be used only 
in rare circumstances, and only when central to the struggle 
for redemption between Spectre and Psyche. As with gaining 
Pathos, above, any result should be agreed upon between the 
Storyteller and the player.

Catharsis

Just as a Shadow can take over a wraith, so too can the 
Psyche  temporarily  dominate  a  Spectre.  If  the  Psyche’s  cur-
rent Pathos points exceed the Spectre’s Willpower score, the 
Psyche  can  attempt  to  assert  control  over  their  shared  form 
for the remainder of the scene. Other Spectres do not notice 
the change automatically; it must be deduced from the newly 
Psyche-ridden character’s unusual behavior.

Catharsis  is  identical  to  the  process  described  for  the 
Shadow (p. 236), except for two key distinctions: the Traits 

used  in  the  Catharsis  roll,  and  who  roleplays  the  Psyche-
dominated character.
The Catharsis Roll

To  try  gaining  control  of  the  Spectre,  the  Psyche  first 
spends 1 Pathos point. A Pathos expenditure that brings the 
Psyche’s Pathos pool lower than the Spectre’s Willpower does 
not negate the Catharsis attempt.

The  Psyche  then  rolls  its  current  Pathos  pool  —  not  its 
permanent rating — in a resisted action against the Spectre’s 
Willpower rating. If the Psyche gets more successes, it gains 
control of the Spectre character for the rest of the scene.
Roleplaying During Catharsis

The Spectre’s player,  not  the Psycheguide, roleplays the 

character while the Spectre is subject to Catharsis.

While  the  Psyche  is  dominant,  it  has  access  to  all  the 
Spectre’s  abilities  and  powers,  including  any  Arcanoi,  Dark 
Arcanoi, and Shadecraft arts. The Psyche retains access to its 
own Fronds as well. Otherwise, the parameters of Catharsis are 
consistent with that described in Chapter 6 (p. 221).

SPECTRES

383

From the Grave to the Cradle

here is a cycle to life and death. You are 
born, you live, you die, you are reborn as 
a wraith, and then you hurtle down the 
slope  toward  Oblivion.  Then  there  are 
the Risen, and they are to the standard 
order of things what a mallet is to a plate.
When  a  wraith  decides  to  return 
as Risen, it’s the first step in an arduous and labyrinthine 
process. The dead aren’t meant to cross back over any more 
than a butterfly is supposed to reinvent itself as a caterpillar. 
It doesn’t happen, and it’s certainly not supposed to. This, 
however, is a world of horrors, and sometimes the gate can 
be forced open the other way, the Shroud torn asunder by 
sheer desperation and will.

Players  can  choose  to  portray  Risen  in  Chronicles  as 
either new characters or preexisting wraith characters who 
need to reenter the Skinlands. Those characters who start as 
wraiths face a dangerous road for even considering becom-
ing one of the Risen. It’s not an easy task — the knowledge 
is rare and forbidden by the decree of the Hierarchy, so just 
asking questions about becoming Risen is in itself a crime. 
Once the wraith starts gathering the pertinent information 

on the down low, she still has to learn the proper Arcanoi to 
affect the transition. This takes time, and it’s not even the 
hardest part yet. That comes when the wraith ventures into 
the Labyrinth to cut a deal with her own Shadow. One does 
not simply walk into the Skinlands. Securing the Shadow’s 
cooperation is paramount to becoming Risen, and that means 
agreeing to unsavory terms after dealing with the Shadow…
Those characters in Risen-centric chronicles that start 
off as the returned, however, may face a constant reminder 
of disappointment and estrangement. It can be a study in 
frustration, because what’s the point of returning to life if 
you can’t return to your life? And when a Risen comes back, 
the details are all wrong because the lens of perception is 
different and the senses perceiving them have been dialed 
down. Colors, smells, sounds, taste…it’s like dropping back 
from HD to cathode ray tubes. Everything is obviously grainy 
and distant and smaller, but when you consider a wraith has 
pierced  the  Shroud  and  seen  the  other  side,  mere  human 
senses can’t hold up against memory or death. The constant 
disappointment alone is enough to feed a Risen’s Shadow, let 
alone the sharper pangs of existence as one of the walking dead.

Chapter 11:  The RisenAnd  no,  becoming  Risen  should  never  be  easy.  This  is 
a thing of mythology, crossing into the land of the dead and 
returning. The act of Rising should reflect those stakes or the 
world would be awash in Risen, to the detriment of both living 
and dead. Crossing the Shroud to become Risen should be an 
earned privilege or hard fought to maintain, so that the risks 
and  losses,  the  struggles  and  victories,  are  that  much  more 
meaningful.

So yes, it is difficult, but that means the victory of achiev-

ing it is that much more rewarding.
What Is a Risen?

A Risen is a wraith who has fought his way back across 
the Shroud and reanimated his body in order to achieve some 
concrete aim. The Shadow, without whose negotiated permis-
sion none of this happens, comes along for the ride. For most 
of a wraith’s time as Risen, the Shadow resides in the Conduit, 
an object (or pet) that’s dear to the Risen. If the Shadow takes 
over, it’s the Psyche that then gets shoved into the Conduit 
temporarily. 

In order to become Risen, a wraith must first acquire cer-
tain specialized knowledge and skills, particularly a few specific 
Arcanos arts. With those in her arsenal, she then must travel 
bodily into the Labyrinth to negotiate a Pact with her Shadow, 
essentially  bargaining  for  the  Shadow’s  willingness  to  come 
along across the Shroud. If the Pact is successfully made, she 
then utilizes the appropriate Arcanoi and climbs back into her 
body — assuming it’s still in good enough shape to be climbed 
back into. At that point, she begins to function as a Risen.

Risen are exceptionally tough, fast, and strong. Designed 
to reach a goal quickly and deal with it efficiently, they have 
tremendous potential as killing machines — which is part of 
the reason the Hierarchy is constantly on the lookout for Risen, 
prime violators of the Dictum Mortuum.

Most wraiths are only Risen for a short time. The journey 
to becoming one of the returned is long and arduous, and the 
risks of Rising are numerous and deadly. As such, few wraiths 
actually make the trip, and most of those who do flame out 
spectacularly along the way. There are numerous things that 
can go wrong for even the best-intentioned Risen: the ease of 
gaining  Angst  in  the  Skinlands,  the  increased  power  of  the 
Shadow, the potential to give one’s self away as undead, and 
the temptation to just start ripping things apart and the hell 
with the consequences — all of these come together to make 
sure a Risen’s stay in the Skinlands is potentially very bloody 
but generally very short.
The Risen Commandments

When it comes to the Risen, there are certain inviolate 
rules  that  bind  their  existence.  Wraiths  who  don’t  abide  by 
these rules simply fail to become Risen — they’re lacking one 

of  the  essential  elements  that  allows  for  the  repossession  of 
their physical forms. When in doubt, Storytellers should refer 
to these as guidelines in making hard and fast decisions about 
what’s allowed and what isn’t.
•  You Have Unfinished Business: Those who return, return 
for a reason. It’s likely tied into why you died or what forced 
you to stick around. The clinical word for it is objective, or 
agenda, but the reality is that it is an obsession that brings 
you back. It’s one that pushes you to risk danger, censure, 
and even destruction, because you simply cannot stop.
•  You Are Not a Zombie: Risen are the walking dead, but 
you are not a zombie. Your hunger is rooted in the Psyche 
and is an emotional need. It is never a physical desire that 
overrides reason, and you are not a mindless engine of hun-
ger. The body unrots when you rise, and aside from some 
wear and tear and a paleness about the flesh, you can pass 
for one of the living (assuming no one checks for a pulse).
•  The Shadow Rules: You cannot become Risen unless your 
Shadow agrees to loosen the ties that bind you both to the 
Shadowlands. If the Shadow does not agree to Rise, you 
cannot physically threaten it or overpower it into doing 
so. That said, the Shadow is made powerful by becoming 
Risen and the danger of falling to its machinations is much 
greater on the other side of the Shroud.

•  Returning is Forbidden: This is true on multiple levels. 
The Hierarchy hunts down practitioners of the arts of Ris-
ing to quash the knowledge of it, while the practitioners 
try to keep the knowledge hidden to protect themselves, 
to protect their edge, or to protect everyone from another 
wraith tempting fate and their Shadow. A Risen who falls 
to her Shadow is a terrifying monster, one that can wreak 
untold havoc across the Skinlands.

•  Getting to the Other Side is Not Easy: It’s as simple as that. 
Finding the knowledge, putting it into practice, convincing 
the Shadow to cooperate, surviving on the other side…
these are dangerous and difficult tasks. Becoming Risen is 
an endeavor of mythic proportion, and every Rising runs 
the risk of becoming a study of what happens when you get 
what you thought you wanted and it turns to ash.

•  Staying on the Other Side is Harder: Returning to the 
Skinlands is never the homecoming a Risen expects. In 
the land of milk and honey, the milk tastes curdled and the 
honey is made from poisoned flowers. Somehow, people 
simply know that you’re not quite right, and they’ll ignore 
or avoid you if they can. The sensations you once experi-
enced are somehow muted. It’s easier to become frustrated, 
and Angst builds up more easily as a result. The Shadow 
already expected this, however, and that may have been 
its ultimate objective in letting you get what you thought 
you wanted.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Becoming Risen

ow  does  a  wraith  go  about  becoming 
Risen? There as many or as few steps as the 
Storyteller  dictates,  but  based  on  canon 
alone,  the  following  section  details  the 
unspoken but official steps in Rising.
• 
 

It  starts  with  intent.  Why  does  the  
wraith need to come back? 

•  Following that is the how, the investigation into the process 
of Rising, since the information is mostly apocryphal and 
difficult to find. 

•  Next comes the Pact, the bargain with the Shadow, and 
that means finding a way into the Labyrinth itself for a 
tête-à-tête. This is the where. 

•  Then comes the transition: the Rising, “who’s reentering 
the character’s body and for whom they might be doing this. 
•  After that, it’s all about the what, as in “what’s next?” and 

the Risen’s adventures in the Skinlands. 

Those are the five steps. The devil, however, is in the 

details.

Step One: The Intent

The why of it is the most important and the most personal 
step. All chronicles with Risen in them must consider this step 
regardless of their focus. The Intent is the driving force behind 
the desire to cross the Shroud and operate once again among 
the Quick.

While all wraiths have unfinished business, for a Risen it 
has to be something more powerful. A Passion so strong, so all-
consuming that it subsumes everything else, it can be anything 
from avenging one’s unsolved murder to needing to get hands 
on to protect a loved one from certain peril. Left unattended, 
the Intent will gnaw at and distract a wraith, putting himself 
and all the other wraiths around him at risk. 

The  locus  of  the  Intent  need  is  a  quantifiable  thing, 
something simple to grasp as a concept: a person, a place, an 
object, a secret. It has a verb attached to it, often with a sense of 
constancy to apply pressure to the need: protect, hide, destroy, 
inform, etc. A character trying to avenge his own death is seeking 
to destroy the person responsible. A character protecting the 
stolen money that’s keeping her son’s medical bills paid is either 
protecting the secret of the theft or the stash of money itself. 
Players can make the agenda seem more complex, but it 
should always boil down to a straightforward object and an easy 
to understand verb. “I was murdered by my partner on the force 
because I wouldn’t play dirty, and now the murderer is trying to 
seduce my wife” is fine so long as the player remembers that it’s 
all about “Kill my murderer” or “Protect my wife.”

These simplicities give the Shadowguide or the player a 
way of obfuscating the terms of the Pact so that what seems 

like one agenda is, in fact, another. The Shadow may gravitate 
more toward “Kill my murderer” because of the opportunity for 
Angst when the real driving force behind the wraith’s actions 
might be “Protect my wife.”

Player  and  Storyteller  should  discuss  the  Intent  before 
starting any story involving a Risen. The duration of a Risen-
centric section of the chronicle should guide the character’s 

SHORTCUTTING THE STEPS

Storytellers are free to modify their chronicles 
as they see fit, and one option includes shortcut-
ting steps to adjust to the playstyle of the game. 
While these options aren’t canonical, they are 
here to offer versatility. The only steps that remain 
sacrosanct, however, are Step One: Intent, and 
Step Three: The Pact.

The  Rabbi:  In  law-enforcement  circles,  a 
“rabbi”  is  someone  who  mentors  subordinates 
and offers them political leverage or protection. 
In Wraith, this is likely a Renegade who knows 
everything  there  is  to  know  about  becoming 
Risen, and offers the characters the information 
and  guidance  required  to  succeed,  cutting  out 
large  chunks  of  Step  Two:  The  Investigation. 
The  rabbi  might  have  her  own  agenda,  but  if 
she’s been purchased as a Background (Contact 
or Mentor), the rabbi shouldn’t set out to screw 
over the Circle, not deliberately.

The Artifact: The Artifact is a powerful item 
that replaces a wraith’s need to understand the 
necessary Arcanoi to become Risen. Regardless of 
its form, it should not eliminate the risks of being 
Risen and it carries the high price tag of turning 
the wraith who possesses it into a target — such 
a valuable item is bound to be coveted by many 
other wraiths. Storytellers can make this a five-dot 
Artifact, but once the characters use it to become 
Risen, they can’t bring it into the Skinlands with 
them. It remains in the Shadowlands and must be 
protected/hidden or be lost. The Artifact cannot 
work on more than one wraith at a time, and it 
should  be  treated  as  a  deus  ex  machina  under 
Storyteller control, and not the player character’s.

No Labyrinth: This eliminates the need to 
venture into the Labyrinth completely. The wraith 
deals directly with the Shadow without a need 
to make the dangerous trek. It doesn’t mean that 
it might not take days or weeks to convince the 
Shadow to reach a mutual accord, but it’s a far 
less dangerous process than a Helldive.

THE RISEN

387

obsession. If the story arc is short, the obsession can be easily 
solved  (“Kill  my  murderer,”  “Tell  my  husband  I  love  him,” 
“Unearth the money from the robbery,” etc.). If the game is 
a full chronicle, the Risen needs a longer obsession arc that 
requires detail, work, and attention (“Find my runaway sister,” 
“Destroy my traitorous partner’s life,” “Protect my unit buddies 
who became hunters,” etc.).
It Isn’t All Altruism

One of the reasons the Shadow might want to enable the 
wraith to become Risen is because the obsession is dangerous 
and can easily be twisted into something else. “I love her,” can 
quickly  become  “Nobody  else  can  have  her.”  “He  got  away 
with my murder,” can transform into “I’ll ruin everything he 
loves.” “My children need protection” is a small step away from 
“They’re useless without me.” Everything can be twisted, every 
noble motivation broken and made selfish. The Shadow revels 
in tearing down the Psyche’s delusions, and if it thinks it can 
turn an obsession against the Psyche, it will cheerfully do so. 

Step Two: The Investigation

For  characters  that  start  as  wraiths,  the  “how”  is  where 
their focus might lie for quite some time. The investigation into 
becoming Risen is a conflict and suspense-rich environment 
for the entire Circle of characters, and something that would 

require everyone’s help given the potential number of smaller 
steps along the way to the ultimate goal.

There are three crucial steps involved in the investigation 
phase of uncovering the secrets of the Risen. The first is tracking 
down legitimate sources of knowledge, the second is convincing 
said sources to share their secrets, and the third is obtaining the 
components of the secrets to prepare for the attempt. 
Tracking Down Sources 

According  to  the  Hierarchy,  becoming  Risen  is  illegal. 
Sure, the Hierarchy has Risen agents in the form of The Order 
of Acherontia Styx, but breaking the rules is the privilege of the 
elite. For everyone else, knowing how to become Risen is a 
crime in itself, officially punishable by a swift trip to the forges. 
This makes practitioners of the art very cautious about who 
they talk to and who they take in as students, and encourages 
them to be hard to find.

The fact that the process is illegal is but the first of many 
reasons the returned are relatively rare. Those who know how 
it works aren’t talking, because those who talk aren’t around for 
long. Atop that, Risen fall more quickly to their Shadows, and 
those in the know don’t trust anyone else to use their knowledge 
safely. Additionally, there is no social networking, which means 
gossip never reaches widespread saturation in the Shadowlands. 
What does become widespread is invariably inaccurate or so 

388

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

diluted as to be meaningless. Everything known about the Risen, 
unless taken from actual knowledgeable sources, comes from a 
game of telephone. The odds that any information a character 
receives is 100% accurate are laughably low.

Still, it’s impossible to kill an idea, and becoming Risen 
holds the status of an urban legend in the Underworld. Every-
one’s heard about it, and everyone has a friend of a friend who 
crossed over before something terrible befell them.

Said sources of information, however, might have some or 
all of the information required to become Risen. They include 
knowing the correct Arcanoi and how they relate to inhabit-
ing one’s former body, how best to negotiate with the Shadow, 
where to go in the Labyrinth and even how to reach it “safely” 
(if there is such a thing), and the dangers a wraith faces in the 
Skinlands once she repossesses her body.
Negotiating with the Sources 

Once the characters find a reputable source for the appro-
priate knowledge, then the negotiations can begin. The style 
of the chronicle should dictate the source’s agenda, what they 
know, and what they want in return for teaching the character 
how to Rise. Anything is fair game, from access to characters’ 
resources and social networks to having the Circle do a favor 
for the source. The trick is in making the players feel uniquely 
qualified to earn the knowledge.

Bear in mind, however, that while coercion and blackmail 
are also tools that can be used to learn the secrets behind tearing 
through the Shroud, it’s likely that someone with the knowl-
edge to become Risen has also been around long enough to be 
a threat in their own right. Meddling with these individuals is 
dangerous, and may have unexpected repercussions.
Training

After the appropriate knowledge is acquired, the would-
be Risen requires some training. In order to tear through the 
Shroud and reinhabit her corpse, a wraith must have a grasp of 
Puppetry as well as an understanding of either Lifeweb, Inhabit, 
or Embody. All four involve touching upon and affecting the 
Skinlands in delicate ways. Specifically, the wraith must have 
1 dot in Puppetry and 2 dots in any combination of Lifeweb, 
Inhabit, and Embody. They must also learn the proper techniques 
for becoming Risen. These vary from teacher to teacher, but 
some form of guidance is necessary in order to focus the wraith’s 
efforts. There are, of course, rumors of codices and tomes on 
how to become Risen, but these are rare at best, mythical at 
worse, and most likely kept very secure in any case.

Storytellers may want to parse out the secret of becoming 
Risen among several different individuals. One wraith might 
know who holds the secret of becoming Risen, the next knows 
the correct Arcanoi involved, while a third has Risen before 
and knows the dangers involved and how to avoid them. And 
of course, each of them wants something in exchange for their 
knowledge. Spreading the information out not only provides 

storytelling beats, but also meshes with the timing it takes for 
a wraith to learn the proper Arcanoi for her quest. 

Storytellers can tackle this situation in one of four ways:
•  The first is that it takes as long as it takes, and the char-
acters can embark on other storylines and misadventures, 
but it’s understood that their downtime involves learning 
the necessary arts. 

•  The  second  way  is  a  slight  twist  in  that  the  characters 
learn about the necessary Arcanoi early, so while hunting 
down more information on becoming Risen they are also 
learning and training. 

•  The third way is effectively a montage. The chronicle takes 
a  leap  forward  in  time  and  the  characters  emerge  from 

THE ORDER OF ACHERONTIA STYX

The  Order  of  Acherontia  Styx  is  an  arm 
of  the  Order  of  the  Unlidded  Eye,  but  it’s  the 
equivalent of a government basement operation 
receiving  hand-me-down  technology  from  a 
decade ago, featuring agents too talented to fire 
and too troublesome for the Inquisition to handle. 
Acherontia Styx is distrusted by the majority of 
the Eye for its offbeat approach to the Skinlands, 
not to mention their offbeat approaches to pretty 
much everything else. But someone has to inves-
tigate the worst, most dangerous breaches of the 
Dictum Mortuum, and these are the wraiths who 
drew — or volunteered to take — the short straw.

The  Order  carries  the  full  power  of  the 
Inquisition. Their mandate is the Risen, which 
means everything from returning themselves to 
deal with catastrophic Risings to hunting down 
purveyors  of  knowledge  of  the  process.  They 
operate on both sides of the Shroud because they 
have to, and some of them are unsettlingly good 
at transitioning between wraith and Risen. They 
play their cards close to the vest and are granted 
a wide degree of discretion in how they pursue 
their goals. This makes them particularly unloved 
by their fellow Inquisitors. 

Being part of Acherontia Styx means bending 
the rules because sometimes a little negotiation 
with the devil isn’t just necessary, it’s essential. 
To  do  their  job  means  crossing  a  few  lines,  as 
each and every one of them has returned at least 
once. That gives them little patience for sticks in 
the mud and Dictum Mortuum literalists. Their 
work — tracking down Shadow-possessed Risen, 
preventing waves of returned from overwhelming 
mortal cities — is too important.

THE RISEN

389

hiding  having  undergone  the  required  training.  There’s 
no telling what happened while they were away, however, 
meaning that friends could be missing, enemies might be 
on their tail, or worse. 

•  The fourth option, but certainly not the last, is that the 
Circle can work together. So long as one of them possesses 
Puppetry and Lifeweb, Embody, or Inhabit, then they all 
benefit. 
This last option is for Storytellers who want to get to the 
Skinlands in a hurry, but it is recommended that this method 
comes with some strict caveats to keep it from being abused.

In the end, though, nothing happens without this next 

step: the Pact. 

Step Three: The Pact

Now comes time for one of the most difficult steps, the 
“where.” To seal the deal, the wraith who intends to Rise must 
venture into the Labyrinth to bargain with her Shadow. It’s a 
process akin to — but not precisely like — a Harrowing, with 
one  of  the  key  differences  being  that  the  wraith  enters  the 
Labyrinth voluntarily.

Wraiths who attempt to make the pilgrimage alone tend 
to  have  a  poor  survival  rate.  As  such,  even  if  it’s  only  one 
member of a Circle who intends to Rise, it’s best if the entire 
group accompanies her in order to get her to her destination 
(and to keep from sidelining the bulk of the Circle during the 
final stages of the character’s quest).
Reaching the Labyrinth

There are a number of ways to reach the Labyrinth, most 
of them involuntary, but those wraiths versed in the mythology 
and process of becoming Risen also know of the safer ways into 
this dire maze. Most would recommend hiring Harbingers who 
specialize in transit to and from the Labyrinth using Argos, but 
there are other routes. Hooking up with Helldivers, following 
Spectres home through the Tempest — there are multiple ways, 
each with their own challenges. Storytellers should consider 
tying elements of the journey to the Labyrinth with the obses-
sion behind becoming Risen. At what cost will the character 
become Risen? Will he betray comrades for a shot at it? Will 
she  ignore  others  in  peril  to  reach  her  goal?  What  does  the 
journey itself reveal about the obsession to reach the Skinlands 
and how does it change that obsession?  

390

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

It  is  entirely  possible  that  taken  this  way,  the  quest  to 
become Risen never happens because the discovery leads to 
character growth, and that growth allows the character to cope 
with their obsession in other ways.

All that said, venturing to the Labyrinth as a Circle means 
trusting one another on the deepest level. The Labyrinth is 
where whispers carry weight, where monstrosities swim beneath 
oceans older than recorded memory, and where Oblivion awaits, 
the ultimate end of ends. Asking friends and associates to go 
there has no precedent because it beggars simile and metaphor. 
The best one could hope for is that whatever happens in the 
Labyrinth, it is swift and decisive.

Wraiths belonging to a Circle need a better reason than “I 
need help” to go along on something like this, because while 
the wraiths themselves might still undertake such mammoth 
favors for a friend, their Shadows will not. So even before the 
journey begins, a group of wraiths better have damn good reason 
to say “yes” to the adventure.
Dealing with the Shadow

Once the characters arrive in the Labyrinth, the aspiring 
Risen can now deal and negotiate with the Shadow. At a suitably 
appropriate spot, his Shadow manifests itself, powered by the 
wraith’s obsession and the nearness of Oblivion. The Shadow 
is merely a vision, incapable of physical interaction, but this 
first step to separation leads down the road to the Conduit.

No wraith can return to the Skinlands without the coop-
eration of the Shadow. The Shadow must agree to return and 
it cannot be forced except through applications of Castigate 
— ones that could prove very risky in the Labyrinth.

Coming to the Labyrinth is no guarantee that the Shadow 
will  cooperate,  either.  While  becoming  Risen  is  something 
that most Shadows are interested in, largely because of the ac-
celerated rate at which Risen accrue Angst, not every Shadow 
wants to take the risk. As for those who do, many of them are 
smart enough to adopt refusal as a negotiating tactic in hopes of 
getting a better deal. The terms of the deal can range from “Let 
me be in charge when we get back” to “You have to deliberately 
feed a Dark Passion” to “You must destroy your favorite Artifact 
before we go,” and they’re infinitely fluid until the moment the 
deal is formally struck. Then, they’re locked in stone. 

That being said, the negotiations do not occur in a vacuum. 
The  Spectres  who  haunt  the  Labyrinth  have  no  respect  for 
the sanctity of the discussion, and will cheerfully set upon any 
interlopers they find in their halls. It is entirely possible for 
the aspiring Risen to be conducting feverish negotiations with 
his Shadow while his Circlemates fight off a shrieking horde 
of Striplings. It’s just as possible that the Shadow summoned 
those Spectres to add a little bit of urgency to the negotiations. 
If the entire circle is going Risen, then they’ll need to fol-
low these steps too, and there’s no telling what the individual 
Shadows will do to get the Psyche in trouble. Shadows have 
no need to cooperate with each other, and may do things to 

thwart each other’s ambitions. Storytellers should be ready to 
deal with the repercussions of doing this, up to and including 
thwarting the Circle from Rising.
What the Shadow Gains

So, why would the Shadow ever agree to allow the wraith 
to reinhabit her body? It seems natural that either whatever the 
Shadow agrees to will be to the detriment of the wraith, or that 
the Shadow will automatically refuse any request to help the 
character, but those aren’t the cases here. In these instances, 
it’s all about risk versus reward for both parties.

For the wraith, the stakes are in tending to an obvious, 
immediate, and driving desire. For the Shadow, the appeal lies 
in the risks the Psyche faces by the attempt. By saying “no, you 
can’t play,” the ploy is straight-out frustration or perhaps even 
fear on the Shadow’s side for the very real dangers it’ll face in 
the Skinlands. To say “yes,” however, means the opportunity 
to watch the character fail, to grow increasingly disillusioned 
with the life he can no longer have, or (best of all) to see him 
pervert the very reason why he went back.
The Pact

The  Pact  is  a  solemn  agreement  between  Psyche  and 
Shadow, unbreakable without dire consequences. To make a 
Pact, each side states their terms, and then the wraith invests a 
point of permanent Willpower. It’s a steep price, but now both 
sides  are  bound  and  the  Shadow  cannot  prevent  the  wraith 
from Rising.

What the Shadow gets from the Pact must be clearly de-
fined, and the wraith must act in good faith within a reasonable 
timeframe to meet those terms. Failure to do so gives the Shadow 
a point of permanent Angst. Certain Shadows are not above 
diverting their Psyches from fulfilling the terms of a Pact in 
order to get the juicy payoff at the end, while others will hound 
the wraith incessantly until they get what’s coming to them.

Step Four: The Rising

Now we come to the “who,” the character’s mortal remains 
and the act of actually diving back into them. For this to hap-
pen, the corpse must be relatively intact in the broadest sense. 
A cremated or decapitated body cannot be reinhabited, and 
there have to be the shriveled remains of a heart and brain for 
Rising to work. A fleshless skeleton is thus a no go as a vessel, 
and bodies that have been dead too long are also often unfitting.
If the body is able to Rise, however, the wraith must travel 
to her body’s location in the Skinlands and settle in. This is 
where the necessary Arcanoi come into play, and a show of 
Willpower is absolutely critical when binding the wraith back 
into her own flesh. 

Note that once the bargain has been struck in the Laby-
rinth with her Shadow, the wraith can take as long as she wants 
— or needs — to actually return to the Skinlands. Odds are, 
however, she won’t want to wait. Getting out of the Labyrinth 

THE RISEN

391

and back into her body in order to take care of business will 
almost certainly become her highest priority.

Stitching one’s self back into their corpse is no mean feat. 
The body carries the residue of traumatic memory, and as the 
soul hooks itself back into the flesh, those memories are a blast 
from a double-barrel shotgun, as strong and intense as thy were 
the moment they happened. The wraith relives her final mo-
ments with a sudden, terrible clarity of the senses.

After  that,  as  the  residual  memory  bleeds  off,  the  body 
stitches itself back together. Tissue and tendons that are missing 
regrow like kudzu; bones reknit as they grind back into solid 
pieces; heart, brain, eyes, and tongue refill their cavities, inflat-
ing inside the Risen’s body; skin tightens; muscles stretch, snap, 
and regrow; embalming fluids, maggots, worms, and anything 
else that doesn’t belong in the human body comes back up in 
a torrent of vomit.

The process is incredibly painful. Thankfully, it is over in 
a matter of minutes, leaving the Risen with a new problem: 
getting out. Most Risen are buried, and a coffin is a terrifying 
place to wake up, especially with wraith senses. The sensory 
overload gives the Risen the panic-fueled strength to escape 
her confines. Fortunately, she doesn’t need to breathe or eat. 
Thus, escaping the grave or the mausoleum is a matter of time 
and brute force, even though experience is screaming at the 
Risen that she should be suffocating.

Once the Risen emerges, things get interesting. Odds are 
she’s broke and wearing her rotted funeral best, which means 
there are two immediate problems staring her in the face. How 
she deals with them can set the tone for her entire experience 
as a Risen, for good or for ill.
The Systems Behind Rising

To actually inhabit one’s body and Rise, a wraith must ride 
the corpse as she would any other mortal. This means doing 
two things. The first is spending one point of Pathos and rolling 
Dexterity + Puppetry (difficulty 6). The second is spending one 
Willpower point to claw through the Shroud, and then making 
a Willpower roll (difficulty 8).

If the wraith fails to make the necessary roll in Puppetry, 
the attempt fails and she remains a ghost in the Shadowlands. 
If  she  succeeds  in  using  her  arts  but  fails  in  the  Willpower 
roll, however, the Shadow slips into the body instead and the 
Psyche is relegated to the Conduit. If the player botches the 
Willpower roll, the Shadow gains control and the character 
gains a point of permanent Angst for each 1 rolled beyond the 
number of successes.
The Conduit

When a wraith steps into her body and reclaims it, the 
Shadow  splits  off  to  reside  in  the  Conduit.  The  Conduit  is 
one of the wraith’s Fetters, usually the strongest one, and be-
ing separated from the Conduit pains Risen and Shadow alike. 
This constant distraction puts the Risen at +1 difficulty on all 
Willpower rolls as long as the two are separated.

The Conduit is critical for the Risen and, ironically, it’s 
because the Shadow must be protected regardless of their rela-
tionship. The Conduit is a talisman of sorts, a physical part of 
the Risen, and its fate is tied to her. It’s for this reason that the 
Conduit has 10 health levels. 

If the Conduit receives damage, the Risen is equally hurt for 
said damage type and cannot heal. Destroy the Conduit, and the 
Risen is sent screaming into a Destruction Harrowing. Conversely, 
if the Risen’s body is destroyed and the Conduit is left behind 
undamaged, it becomes a potent link to the Shadowlands, imbued 
with the malicious intent left behind by the Shadow. Hunters of 
such items would pay a fortune to get their hands on said Conduit 
or do their utmost to kill whoever possesses one.  

Because of the significance of Conduits to the Risen and 
vice versa, the Fetter in question should be small and easily 
transportable so the Risen can keep it on their body, and more 
importantly, the Conduit should be near the Risen when she 
returns to the Skinlands. Some Risen insist on carrying their 
Conduit  with  them  at  all  times  for  protection,  while  others 
prefer to risk the distraction and hide it in a safe place. 

Sometimes,  the  positions  are  reversed  and  the  Shadow 
slips into the body while the Psyche is forced into the Conduit. 
This can happen during a Catharsis roll, or when the Risen first 
attempts to occupy her body. When this occurs, the Shadow 
must still keep the Conduit safe, but the player still plays her 
Risen character with the objectives of the Shadow. This means 
trying to fulfill its Dark Passions, or undermining the Risen’s 
objectives until the Psyche resumes control. As for the Psyche, 
during Catharsis, the Shadow can sever its connection to its 
body’s senses, putting the character in utter, hellish darkness 
and absolute silence as long as the Catharsis lasts. 

ANIMAL CONDUITS
Sometimes, a Fetter is too large and the Con-
duit becomes something tied to it rather than the 
Fetter itself. A family home is too large to serve as 
a Conduit, but the family dog who lives there is a 
much more appropriate size. Should it be chosen 
as a Conduit, the animal’s psyche is obliterated 
and the body becomes a husk for the Shadow, 
which can enjoy a newfound freedom not previ-
ously  available  to  immobile  Conduits.  Animal 
Conduits  tend  to  follow  their  Psyches  closely, 
but they’re not frolicsome pets. Empowered with 
mobility, fully aware Shadows guiding the bodies 
of animals can provoke all sorts of havoc. 

If the Psyche is ever forced into the animal 
Conduit, it can use the animal’s senses just fine, 
and even “run away” from its owner to force the 
Shadow to come after it (rather than embarking 
on mayhem).

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Step Five: Existence as Risen

Welcome to the land of the living, also known as the “what” 
or “what next?” The Risen has emerged and this is as good as 
his body’s going to get: passably alive. This is everything he’s 
geared himself toward, pursuing the object of his obsession and 
putting matters to the right. This will not be the happy reunion 
a Risen expects, however. The Risen returns with senses that 
have beheld and were warped by the Underworld, and they can 
never see the living, breathing world the same way. Everything 
is doomed to die, and the wraith will often fixate on the ebb 
of that cycle.

The lost human senses don’t return with the same clarity, 
and the reality of a rose cannot hold up against the memory 
of its beauty. More so, the Risen comes back with additional 
senses:  their  Deathsight,  Lifesight,  and  Heightened  Senses. 
Their eyesight and hearing are microscopes and microphones 
held to the living world; they no longer perceive the painting 
as a whole, but rather see the individual brushstrokes of dried, 
cracked paint. How can one appreciate the beauty of life when 
all they can see are its imperfections?

Then there’s the obsession, the one compulsion that drove 
the wraith to risk damnation and destruction to get this far. The 
Risen is less likely to stop and smell the roses when all he can 
think about is his obsession. Everything becomes a distraction, 
with the clock ticking, the Shadow waiting, and the obsession 
that powered the wraith out of the grave not letting him rest.
As a result, Risen strive toward realizing the object of their 
quest with all speed. They don’t sleep, they don’t eat, and they 
power themselves endlessly toward their driving obsession. At 
the same time, they may need to collaborate with mortals to 
achieve their goals, and that means trying to fit in with human-
ity long enough to build the needed relationships to achieve 
the Risen’s ends. Making human connections could ameliorate 
the Shadow’s pernicious influence, but at the same time they 
could distract the Risen from the reason for returning, and that 
potentially opens the door to disaster. It’s a fine line to walk, 
and a Risen is always caught in that tension.
Roleplaying: Risen & Wraith Alike

Risen  chronicles  can  go  one  of  two  ways:  Everyone’s  a 
Risen, or a small subset of the Circle — usually one wraith — 
Rises and his friends operate with him from the other side of 
the Shroud. Each offers unique challenges and opportunities.
If all of the characters go Risen, then the focus of the narra-
tive shifts to the Skinlands, and to making sure everyone holds it 
together long enough to take care of business without succumbing 
to Catharsis or the perils of the material world. A Risen Circle 
can find themselves working together to track down the man 
who murdered them all, or they can find themselves working at 
cross purposes if one Risen’s Fetter turns out to be another Risen’s 
target. Note that not every Risen story needs to be about bloody 
vengeance. Tales of love, redemption, and preservation work just 
as well as Risen narratives as vindictive gorefests. 

Alternately,  if  only  part  of  the  Circle  returns,  then  the 
dynamic  turns  to  one  of  interplay,  with  the  wraiths  poten-
tially helping the Risen from one side of the Shroud while the 
returned wraith takes care of business (and maybe sees to her 
friends’ requests as well) in the Skinlands. This sort of narra-
tive can encompass anything from a heist story to a desperate 
drive to protect endangered Fetters to a straight-out quest for 
vengeance with the rest of the Circle insubstantially cheering 
the Risen on. That being said, there’s also room for tension, 
if the wraiths who did not Rise start dealing with Hierarchy 
pressure, or someone’s Shadow fuels resentment that his friend 
got to Rise while he didn’t. 
Happy Endings

Risen stories rarely end well, at least not for the Risen. 
It’s impossible for one of the returned to have a “happily ever 
after.” The best a Risen can hope for is to leave a loved one 
better or safer than they were before, and maybe with a little 
closure. But even if a Risen succeeds in his obsession to keep 
his widow safe from the hired killers pursuing her, what’s next is 
inevitably a return to the Underworld and a constant fear that 
the victory was only a temporary one. This infuses even the 
most over-the-top Risen campaign with a hint of melancholy. 
Success, at least for a Risen, carries its own punishments with it.
Closing Time

All good things must come to an end, and that includes a 
wraith’s time as Risen. In some cases, it’s as simple as the Psyche 
choosing to renounce Risen status in order to flee back across the 
Shroud. If Shadow objects, there’s a contested Willpower vs. tem-
porary Angst roll (difficulty 7), with the winner making the call on 
whether to stay or go. Once the wraith leaves her body to return to 
the Underworld, it immediately begins decaying normally. Risen 
who wish to return at a later date often try to make arrangements 
for their mortal shells in order to preserve them against the ravages 
of time, but these efforts are not always successful. 

A Risen who chooses to go back isn’t always successful in 
her driving mission, and not every mission results in a Resolved 
Passion  or  Fetter.  Sometimes  the  wraith  is  only  able  to  score 
a partial victory, staving off immediate peril but aware of the 
dangers that lie ahead. Alternately, maybe the Risen’s goal can’t 
be accomplished, even with all the power at her disposal, and 
she has to admit defeat — for the moment. Such failures, partial 
victories, and tactical retreats provide rich fodder for the Shadow.
Other times, the choice is taken away from the Risen. If 
the Risen’s mortal body suffers enough damage both Psyche and 
Shadow are booted unceremoniously back into the Underworld. 
The same applies if the Conduit is destroyed — both Psyche 
and Shadow are pulled into the Labyrinth immediately, and 
the wraith faces a Destruction Harrowing.

If the Risen actually succeeds in wrapping up and Resolv-
ing his driving Passion, then he loses his impetus to Rise and, 
within 24 hours, finds himself drifting back across the Shroud, 
Shadow in tow. The extra time should allow for appropriate 

THE RISEN

393

farewells and the return of the Risen’s body to a proper loca-
tion, granting closure on the story arc to player and Risen alike. 
As for Transcendence, while it is theoretically possible for 
a Risen to Transcend if she has resolved her last Fetter and Pas-
sion while in the Skinlands, such an event would be extremely 
unlikely, not to mention liable to attract all sorts of attention.

The Systems of the Risen
Character Creation

raiths  who  become  Risen  already  have  a 
character sheet in place, which is modified by 
their experiences learning how to become one 
of the returned. Characters who start as Risen, 
on  the  other  hand,  go  through  a  character 
generation process similar to that of a normal 
wraith. However, there are some key differences 

that come with starting off on the bright side of the Shroud.
Step One: Concept

Obsession is the core of the character, meaning that regard-
less of the character’s overall concept, it must include elements 
that  reflect  a  Risen’s  determination  and  desperation.  It’s  all 
about the reason she came back, and that means: Who was she 
before she died? What elements of her former life brought her 
back? How far will she go to succeed?

Nature and Demeanor
These function as advertised during wraith character cre-
ation, but some Natures like Bon Vivant, Child, and Conniver 
don’t necessarily make for focused, obsessive characters, at least 
not without a very good explanation.
Step Two: Attributes

There are two concrete limitations on a Risen’s Attributes: 
a minimum Strength rating of 3 and a maximum Appearance 
of 3. The Strength requirement is necessary because the Risen 
must often claw and batter their way out of their tomb, and it’s 
a sad day when someone goes through all that effort to Rise, just 
to be trapped screaming and helpless in their grave. The Appear-
ance rating is set because while the body repairs the worst of the 
damage to one’s physical appearance, death does take its toll.
Step Three: Abilities

As per wraith character-creation guidelines.

Step Four: Advantages

Risen require a specific toolset to return, and this means 
there are some must-have Advantages and special case mentions.

Arcanoi
All Risen must invest in Puppetry, with another two dots 
spent in or split between Lifeweb, Inhabit, and Embody. These 

Arcanoi encompass the bread and butter of a wraith’s skill to 
rise, but it does leave newly minted Risen characters with only 
two dots to spend on other Arcanoi, including the two Risen-
specific arts covered in this chapter.

Background
The adage “you can’t take it with you” works both ways 
with Backgrounds. Risen only possess five dots in Backgrounds, 
and  cannot  pick  Artifact,  Mentor,  or  Status  because  those 
are exclusive to the Shadowlands. For others like Allies and 
Contacts, the player must specify whether those apply to the 
Shadowlands or to the Skinlands. 

Fetters and the Conduit
A  Risen  requires  10  points  worth  of  Fetters,  with  the 
primary one serving as their Conduit. On rare occasions, the 
Conduit can be something other than a Fetter, but in that case 
it must be something related to a Fetter, such as a loved one’s 
wedding ring. Living mortals can never be used as Conduits, 
nor can noncorporeal items like favorite songs. 

Players can also assign their characters 10 points worth of 
Passions, with the most powerful one being that which drove 
them to return. Resolving that driving Passion can also end a 
Risen’s time in the Skinlands.
Step Five: Finishing Touches

The  following  are  the  final  steps  in  creating  a  Risen 

character.

Pathos and Willpower
Risen possess an initial Pathos rating of 5 and an initial 

Willpower of 6. Players may use freebie points to buy more.

Freebie Points
Players  may  spend  15  freebie  points  to  round  out  their 
Risen characters. They can also spend freebie points to gain the 
functional equivalent of a few select Vampire: The Masquerade 
Disciplines, specifically Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence. These 
are regarded as Arcanoi for freebie and XP point cost, and are 
powered by Pathos (or Angst) instead of Vitae.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

HOW DISCIPLINES WORK FOR RISEN

Risen aren’t vampires, and they don’t actually 
“get” vampiric Disciplines. Instead, they acquire the 
functional equivalent of those powers, with very 
specific effects tuned to the Risen. The ability to use 
these powers is one of the reasons Risen are often 
mistaken for vampires, the other being that most 
people have a hard enough time believing in one 
kind of walking corpse, and two is beyond the pale. 

The first dot in a Discipline costs 10 Experience, 
with new dots costing the current rating multiplied by 
five. Below are the ways these powers work for Risen.

Potence — Spend a point of Pathos (or Angst, if 
the Shadow’s in control), get an additional number of 
dice in Strength equal to the Risen’s Potence rating.

Fortitude  —  Spend  a  point  of  Pathos  (or 
Angst,  if  the  Shadow’s  in  control),  get  an  ad-
ditional number of dice in Stamina equal to the 
Risen’s Fortitude rating.

Celerity — Spend a point of Pathos (or Angst), 
gain an additional action that turn for each point 
spent. The maximum number of actions equal the 
number of dots the Risen has in Celerity.

Back to Life, Back to Reality

There are some final touches that can be added. The fol-

lowing, however, are specific to Risen.

Basic Wraith/Risen Abilities
It’s a given that Risen lose their insubstantiality, but they 
do  retain  their  innate  abilities  of  Deathsight,  Lifesight,  and 
Heightened Senses. They also know the location of their Conduit 
and have a vague impression of its location. If someone else is 
touching or holding the Conduit, the character can use Arcanoi 
on the target that would normally require eye contact or touch.
Risen are also dead, which means they don’t need to sleep, 
they don’t need to breathe, and they don’t need to eat or drink. 
In fact, eating and drinking causes them discomfort and they 
vomit up anything they imbibe almost immediately. Risen also 
feel neither pleasure nor pain, except in rare cases of aggravated 
damage, and their failure to react to small sensations — a stubbed 
toe, a caress of a cheek — is sometimes what gives them away.

Appearance and Mannerisms
Upon returning, Risen heal most of the damage done to 
them by decomposition, but the wounds that killed them remain 
visible as scars. They’re warm(ish) to the touch, appear alive to 
the casual glance, and don’t smell unduly of decay.

But death doesn’t leave the Risen completely. One Risen 
may itch uncontrollably where maggots once gnawed her dead 

flesh, while another could have the eerie pallor of a corpse that’s 
spent too much time underwater. There’s no hard or fast rule, 
but there’s always something there that hints that the Risen’s 
come back from beyond the grave. 

The Shadow
Risen have Shadows, too. Ideally, they spend most of their 
time inside the Conduit, but on occasion they can take control 
and use the Risen’s body to devious ends. 

A Risen’s Shadow should be created according to the same 
rules as those for a normal wraith. Risen Shadows do stay in the 
Psyche’s mind like normal, even if the Conduit is miles away, 
and they can still use most of their Thorns. (Those that are 
Underworld specific, like Tainted Relic, don’t function in the 
Skinlands.)  Risen  Shadowguides  should  always  doublecheck 
Thorn  effects  with  the  Storyteller  before  unleashing  them, 
as they may have very different results in the Skinlands than 
anyone could expect.

Wraith to Risen, Along for the Ride
If the characters begin as wraiths and go through the steps 
to become Risen, they must meet the minimum requirements for 
Attributes and Arcanoi as detailed previously, with a Strength 
rating of 3, a point in Puppetry, and two more in any variation of 
Lifeweb, Inhabit, and Embody. When it comes to Appearance, 
however, if the character has a rating over 3, it drops down to 
3 when he Rises and only returns in the Shadowlands. 

Backgrounds remain, with Artifact, Status, and Contacts 
no longer applicable in the Skinlands. Storytellers can rule, 
however, that if Allies and Mentors can communicate or aid 
the Risen in the land of the quick, then the Background points 
apply as indicated. The same is true for arts and powers, with 
certain Arcanoi holding no power in the Skinlands and vampire 
Disciplines not crossing over into the Shadowlands.

Now  if  the  rumors  are  to  be  believed,  there  are  some 
kindhearted Storytellers out there who realize that characters 
will be disproportionately affected if the whole Circle Rises. 
Some characters may not suffer the loss of functionality, while 
others may be so gutted as to make the players feel useless. If 
this happens, the Storyteller can decide that Backgrounds or 
Abilities get swapped. Lost points in Arcanoi can become Po-
tence, Celerity, or Fortitude instead. Backgrounds may revert 
to Skinlands variants instead; a criminal who loses Shadowland 
Allies and Mentors can call on help from former associates from 
among the Quick (“Hey, I heard you was dead.”)

Risen Arcanoi

isen have two Arcanoi that are unique to 
them.  No  Guilds  exist  to  preserve  their 
knowledge and few Risen exist to pass them 
along. That said, they are instinctive enough 
that the returned find a way to learn them 
if so interested; it may speak to the legends 

THE RISEN

395

that  once  upon  a  time  the  Shroud  was  porous  enough  that 
some wraiths could come and go as they pleased, and that the 
knowledge they carried embedded itself in the Shroud like an 
insect caught in amber.

Because there are no Guilds to teach the Risen Arcanoi, 

they each have only a single path. 

Fascinate

Fascinate  is  an  extension  of  the  Risen’s  own  obsessive 
nature,  a  way  of  turning  it  without  rather  than  within.  It  a 
focused, distilled version of that obsession that allows the re-
turned to influence the Quick by inserting a compulsion into 
their thoughts. It’s related to Keening, but where Chanteurs 
work the heart, Fascinate works the mind.

To use Fascinate, the Risen must make eye contact with the 
target, preferably when they are alone. This sense of intimacy 
increases the difficulty if other people are present. That said, 
Fascinate cannot force a mortal to do anything that is against 
his nature. Instead it serves as a mechanism for persuasion, and 
remains on the mind until completed.
• Distraction

The target is forced to remember something else that needs 
attending to, breaking the mortal’s concentration, if only briefly.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Fascinate (dif-
ficulty:  target’s  Willpower).  If  successful,  the  target  cannot 
focus on their original concern and suffers a +2 increase to all 
difficulties. The number of successes determines the length of 
the effect.
1 Success 
2 Successes 
3 Successes 
4 Successes 
5 Successes 
 
There is no cost to this art. The Risen can only Distract the 
target once per scene, and a botch renders the target immune 
to further distractions for the next day.
•• Remembrance

Target is momentarily distracted.
Target is occupied for a turn.
Target is distracted for three turns
The target’s attention is diverted for a scene.
The  target  feels  compelled  to  leave  the  
location to attend to other business.

 

Remembrance is the power to implant a set of simple in-
structions into the target, conditional on a trigger. Until that 
trigger is activated, the target doesn’t remember the instructions 
or even that he received any, which means he can’t be forced 
to give up any information about what he’s been told to do. 
Once the trigger condition is met, however, the target suddenly 
remembers the instructions like he’s known them all along. 

The trigger is set when the art is used, and must be something 
simple like a phrase, a particular scent, or a specific length of 
time. The instructions must be clear, simple, and straightfor-
ward: “Remember this password” or “after three days, call this 
lawyer.” Detailed instructions involving multiple, complicated 
steps are beyond the capabilities of this art.

System: The player rolls Manipulation + Fascinate (dif-
ficulty: target’s Willpower). The number of successes gained 
determines the length of time the target can remember the in-
structions and still be triggered. If the duration expires before the 
conditions are met, the mortal forgets that information forever.
1 Success 
2 Successes 
3 Successes 
4 Successes 
5 Successes 

Target retains the information for a day.
Target retains the information for three days.
Target retains the information for a week.
Target retains the information for three weeks.
Target retains the information for a month.
Using this art costs 1 Pathos. A failure means no information 
was implanted but the Risen can try again next scene, while a 
botch means the target gets the instructions disastrously wrong. 
••• Charge of Duty

With this ability, the Risen gives the target a simple instruc-
tion that cuts through everything else in their lives to become 
an imperative so long as it fits their Nature or is relevant to 
their circumstances. It won’t force someone to rob a bank if 
that was never in their cards, but it might prey on the target’s 
existing sense of guilt or obligation and force them to do the 
right thing. It’s a push in the direction the target was already 
going, not a shove in a new direction.

System: Roll Charisma + Expression (difficulty: target’s 
Willpower).  The  number  of  successes  indicates  the  target’s 
strength of conviction in the matter; one overall success on 
causing  a  husband  to  cheat  on  his  wife  might  be  met  with 
tremendous guilt, while three or more successes might see the 
husband blame his wife for driving him to infidelity. A botch, 
however, allows the target to realize he was being manipulated, 
and renders him immune to further such attempts.

This art costs 2 Pathos. A botch gives the Risen’s Shadow 

a point of Angst.
•••• Overriding Behavior

The  Risen  plants  an  obsessive-compulsive  tic  into  the 
mortal’s brain, forcing her into a rote of repetitive or ritual-
ized behavior in order to function. So long as the compulsion 
is repetitive and does not put the target or her loved ones in 
obvious danger, there’s any number of potential possibilities. 
Inflicting  obsessive-compulsive  behavior  may  seem  like 
an odd thing to do, more mischievous or cruel than useful, but 
Risen can use this ability to destroy the target’s professional 
or private life by forcing them to commit questionable acts or 
creating a pattern of behavior to cast suspicion on the target. 
More often, however, a Risen uses it as leverage to force a target 
into following orders at the risk of having a loved one targeted.
System: The character must spend 3 Pathos and 1 Will-
power point, giving her a point of temporary Angst. The player 
must  then  roll  Fascinate  +  Intimidation  (difficulty:  target’s 
Willpower) to succeed. The more successes gained, the stronger 
the implanted obsession’s hold on the target, and the less they 
think it’s an outside compulsion. A target can’t receive more 

396

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

than one Overriding Behavior, and if the Risen botches the 
attempt, the Risen’s Shadow gets an extra 2 points of temporary 
Angst. Note that the victim won’t do something diametrically 
opposed to who they are, but that still leaves plenty of latitude. 
••••• Target Lock

If the Risen are driven by their obsessions, this is the ulti-
mate expression of that overriding need. The Risen can force 
the target to fixate on a specific someone or something that 
consumes them like a mania. Even the most calm and rational 
human being becomes an automaton under the influence of this 
power, mirroring the strength of the Risen’s own obsession. The 
obsession can be focused on an item, a person, or an action, but 
once it’s triggered, it’s relentless.   

System:  This  power  costs  3  Pathos  and  2  Willpower 
points, and gives the Shadow 2 temporary Angst. The target 
must be within sight, after which the Risen rolls Fascinate + 
Manipulation (difficulty target’s Willpower) and vocalizes the 
obsession. Each success strengthens the obsession and enables 
the obsession to have more complex parameters, so that a one-
success suggestion like “he should be with you,” can become 
a multiple-successes suggestion like “he’ll only belong to you 
once you get his wife out of the way.” Naturally, a botch turns 
that mirror on the Risen, causing the target to obsess over the 
character and adding one more unwelcome complication to his 
existence in the Skinlands. 

Storytellers  should  feel  free  to  place  parameters  on  the 
boundaries of the obsession in question to make sure the play 
experience does not become an uncomfortable one for anyone 
at the table. Players should discuss their proposed uses of this 
power with the Storyteller beforehand to make sure that ev-
eryone’s comfortable.

Serendipity

This art turns the Risen into the favored child of the fates, 
allowing her to be in the right place at the right time. It enables 
the returned to see the thousands of coincidences that happen 
every day, and to understand how they are interlinked and which 
ones are important. By grasping this web of interconnectivity, 
the Risen can position herself to take advantage of a situation 
that others might miss.
• Fortuitous Wandering

Mockingly referred to as “zen meandering” by some returned, 
this ability gives the Risen a general idea of a direction to follow 
when pursuing one of his Passions. Unfortunately, the player won’t 
know which one his character might be pursuing, and there’s 
always a chance that this will take them away from another Pas-
sion of equal importance. Regardless, it provides direction in a 
world that can be overwhelming to one of the newly returned.

System: The player rolls Serendipity + Awareness (difficulty 
6), with the number of successes achieved determining how 
strongly the character feels that he should be going a particular 
way. The more successes, the clearer the path. 

THE RISEN

397

•• Flashback

This gives the Risen the ability to see images of events that 
unfolded near or around one of her Fetters. For this to work, 
the Risen must be in contact with the Fetter in question; the 
scene that she sees will be the most emotionally potent one 
since the Risen’s original death. The images are clear enough 
to extract clues from the scene, like the face of a murderer or 
the words spoken during a heated argument. 

System: When the character touches one of her Fetters, 
the player can spend 2 points of Pathos and roll Serendipity + 
Awareness (difficulty: 9 minus the Fetter’s rating). The number 
of successes will determine the vividness and duration of the 
scene being recalled, meaning the character may see more or 
learn more. A botch will blind the Risen for a number of minutes 
equal to the difficulty value of the roll and give the Shadow a 
point of Angst.  Repeated uses of Flashback on a particular Fetter 
will reveal scenes of increasingly diminishing emotional heft.
••• The Face in the Crowd

This ability enables the Risen to tell if someone she has 
met is linked to one of her Fetters or Passions. It may even 
define which one, but not how the person’s connected or the 
reason for that connection.

System:  The  player  rolls  Serendipity  +  Empathy  while 
speaking to the target, but the nature and length of the con-
versation determines the difficulty of the target value. If the 
conversation is short and forgettable like “Can you tell me the 
time?” then the Difficulty is 9. The greater the familiarity of 
those conversing and the longer the conversation, the lower 
the difficulty drops, to a minimum of 5. 

The number of successes determines several things, starting 
with whether the target is tied to one of the character’s Fetters 
or Passions. After that, more successes reveal which Passion or 
Fetter is involved and how important that connection might be. 
A botch, however, is full of wonderful tidbits of misinformation.

Using this art costs 2 Pathos. 

•••• Fortuitous Meeting

This art is the ability to tweak the coincidences seen by 
a Risen with Serendipity to arrange to “run in” to someone in 
a  manner  that  appears  to  be  entirely  accidental.  The  target 
never knows that the universe conspired to bring him into the 
Risen’s path, and so will inexplicably turn left instead of right 
while driving, or might have a hankering for takeout Thai from 
a place across town… whatever it takes to bring him to the 
Risen while making it seem like a coincidence. 

System: The player must spend 1 Willpower and 3 Pathos 
points to initiate the Fortuitous Meeting, and she must have 
met  the  target  at  least  once.  The  player  rolls  Serendipity  + 
Manipulation  (difficulty  7),  with  the  number  of  successes 
dictating how quickly the target stumbles across the Risen. A 
botch, however, results in the Risen receiving 2 points of Angst 
and the target being spooked into going the other way instead.

For the power to work, the target must be within 100 miles 
of the Risen and able to travel; targets who are being held hos-
tage, imprisoned, or bedridden, for example, cannot heed the 
call. If the target’s unable to come or out of range, the Pathos 
and Willpower are spent to no effect. 
••••• The Drum Beats On

Serendipity  and  synchronicity  converge  in  this  art  that 
allows the Risen to pull on one string of causality and create a 
chain reaction of events that bring about a desired outcome. 
It’s like a series of dominoes falling, where the Risen can push 
the right domino at the right time to cause the others to fall 
into place; this art allows the returned to intuitively know how 
that sequence will happen even if he doesn’t understand exactly 
which event might lead to another. 

The Risen need only focus on a desired outcome, like “I 
need a way to sneak into that building” or “I need someone at 
the airport to overlook their luggage for a moment.” She then 
sees the first loose thread connected to that desire, pulls on it, 
and lets the universe do the rest. The rest then falls into place 
as a series of events. For example, she wants to enter a building, 
and then spots a discarded hot dog on the street and the empty 
dumpsters in the alley behind the building. With her art telling 
her all three are interconnected, she drops the hot dog in a 
dumpster and waits. A hungry kitten appears and tries getting 
to the food in the dumpster, but it can’t jump up that high. A 
maintenance worker exits through the building’s alley door on 
a smoke break, sees the kitten, and, soft touch that he is, goes 
to help it out. The conveniently open door is overlooked for a 
few seconds, and the Risen slips inside.

System:  The  player  spends  4  Pathos  and  1  Willpower, 
then  rolls  Serendipity  +  Manipulation,  with  the  difficulty 
based  on  the  desperation  of  the  need.  The  more  immediate 
the  desired  result,  the  easier  it  is  to  predict  the  outcome  of 
events, so anything that needs to happen within up to three 
turns requires a roll at difficulty 6, while a scene is difficulty 7, 
a day is difficulty 8, and anything up to a week is difficulty 9. 
Beyond that, there are too many stimuli and outside forces to 
accurately navigate cause and effect; only greatest masters of 
the Arcanos can reach out that far.

The greater the number of successes, the more Serendipity 
is on the character’s side. Each additional success above the 
first can lower the difficulty of any roll associated around The 
Drum Beats On. So if the Risen is trying to enter a building 
(difficulty 6), and rolls 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, that’s a total of two successes 
or one additional success. That means when he sneaks past the 
distracted maintenance worker, and rolls Dexterity + Stealth, 
the difficulty for that action is lowered by 1.

A failure produces no effect. A botch, however, focuses 
the universe’s unwanted attention on the Risen, with the Risen 
simply having no luck and somehow attracting all the unwanted 
attention possible for a number of turns equal to the Shadow’s 
current temporary Angst rating. In addition, the Shadow gets 
a point of temporary Angst.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Storytelling the Risen

ecoming  Risen  may  be  difficult  for 
characters,  but  not  for  their  players.  A 
Risen chronicle can offer new possibilities 
to an ongoing Wraith chronicle, as well as 
changing up some of the base rules of the 
campaign in interesting ways.

The Rules of the Risen

The following deal with the unique rules surrounding the 
Risen and the dangers they may face from previously mentioned 
threats like Angst and combat.
Angst

Returning to the land of Quick does not make the Risen 
alive. They are, instead, tantalizingly close, and it is the frustra-
tion of being lifelike but not alive that makes being Risen so 
appealing to the Shadow. In addition to the constant frustra-

tion that being Risen entails, every use of an Arcanos besides 
Fascinate or Serendipity gains the user an additional point of 
Angst on top of any normally incurred. Furthermore, the dif-
ficulty on all rolls to gain Angst is lowered by 1, thus allowing 
the Shadow to gain Angst more quickly and giving it greater 
leverage over the Psyche.
Risen Corpus and Damage

Risen  have  health  equal  to  their  Corpus  rating  up  to  a 
maximum of 10 equivalent health levels. Because the Risen 
aren’t affected by pain, combat-related injuries will not distract 
them or slow them down. The only exception to this rule is 
from aggravated damage, specifically that done by fire, certain 
supernatural powers, and from werewolf and vampire claws and 
fangs. This means they do not suffer from penalties to their 
dice pool normally, unless that damage is aggravated. Fire, for 
example, will incur a dice pool penalty of -1 die per wound 
level (with a minimum of 2 dice available on any given roll).
A Risen can heal damage to her Corpus by spending Pathos, 
restoring 1 Corpus point per turn. If the Shadow is in control, 

CATHARSIS AS RISEN

For Risen characters, the rules remain mostly the same as wraiths, and Catharsis rolls are triggered foremost 

when a Shadow’s temporary Angst rating exceeds the Psyche’s permanent Willpower rating. 

Additionally, however, the Shadow may also attempt to wrest away control of the Risen’s body when either 
the Shadow converts temporary Angst into one point of permanent Angst, basically endowing the Risen’s 
mission with a sense of desperation that she’s losing her grip on what matters, or when the Risen burns all 
her Pathos and still has at least 1 Corpus level left. Admittedly, this is a godsend of sorts in combat, giving 
the Shadow a chance at taking over with its Angst reserves at the ready, and giving the Risen a second wind 
in combat that may catch opponents off guard.

Regardless, when the Shadow jumps into the driver’s seat, the Psyche is forced into the Conduit. This is 
important, because the Shadow has the option of cutting off all the Psyche’s senses in the Conduit, trapping 
him in utter darkness and silence, or allowing him to see and hear everything the Shadow does in his body. 
It’s all a matter of which torment is worse.

Once a Shadow rides a Risen, it has no access to its Thorns, but it does have access to the character’s 
Arcanoi. The only hindrance is with the Shadow’s version of Serendipity, as the Shadow cannot locate people 
or objects related to the Psyche’s Passions. It can only target those things related to the Shadow’s own Dark 
Passions.

The duration of the Shadow’s control depends on how the Psyche was relegated to the Conduit. For rolls 
involving Angst gain, the Shadow controls the body for a scene, but for Catharsis rolls involving the loss 
of all Pathos, the Shadow rides the body until the character starts regaining Pathos. The Shadow has a full 
12 hours of control before the Psyche can roll to regain Pathos, and even then, the roll is made only if the 
Shadow has acted in accordance with one of the wraith’s Passions. If the Shadow engages with the Risen’s 
driving Passion, the difficulty on the roll is 8. If it’s any other Passion, the difficulty is 9. A failure means no 
Pathos is gained, while a botch prevents further attempts for another 12 hours. 

Once the Psyche has acquired Pathos equal to the Shadow’s current Angst rating, she can initiate a re-
verse Catharsis roll (Willpower vs. current Angst rating) for control of the Risen’s body. A failure leaves the 
Shadow in charge for another hour before the Psyche can try again; a botch strips the wraith of her Pathos, 
and she must start the process of securing Pathos all over again.

THE RISEN

it  can  do  the  same  using  Angst.  In  either  case,  if  the  Risen 
loses all her Corpus levels but still has Pathos/Angst, she will 
appear unconscious for an amount of time equal to Stamina 
+ Fortitude (difficulty 10 minus current Pathos rating). The 
number of successes gained determines how quickly the Risen 
awakens, but if the Pathos rating brings the difficulty of the roll 
down to 1 or 0, then the Risen awakens instantly.

Bear  in  mind  that  a  Risen  who’s  fighting  to  achieve  a 
driving Passion is likely to be generating a tremendous amount 
of Pathos as it goes along. That Pathos can then be spent to 
heal the damage the Risen takes in pursuit of her goal. This 
is the source of stories of Risen who are unstoppable killing 
machines, soaking up entire magazines’ worth of bullets with-
out falling as they wade their way through hordes of enemies 
who stand between them and their goal. It’s also something 
that’s potentially rife for abuse, and Storytellers should keep 
a careful eye on exactly how quickly a Risen’s cycling Pathos.

If a Risen goes unconscious, the Shadow can call for an 
immediate Catharsis roll. Alternately, if the Psyche thinks the 
Shadow is better equipped to handle a particular situation, then 
control can be surrendered voluntarily. Of course, handing the 
keys over to the Shadow comes with its own problems, but needs 
must when the devil drives. 

If, however, a Risen loses all Corpus and Pathos points, 
the wraith’s spirit is ejected from the body, which immediately 
returns to its normal, decayed state. The wraith, reunited with 
his Shadow, finds himself in the Shadowlands near where his 
body went down to its final rest, stunned for a number of turns 
equal to the Shadow’s current Angst rating. 

If an enemy somehow manages to destroy a Risen’s heart 
and brain simultaneously, then the Risen falls into a Destruction 
Harrowing. Even if the wraith survives, he can never become 
Risen again, as his mortal shell is damaged beyond the point 
where it can be inhabited any longer.
To Slumber, Perchance to Heal

Risen cannot retreat into their Fetters to heal while Slum-
bering, so they must be in contact with a Fetter or their Conduit 
while attempting to Slumber for an uninterrupted eight hours. 
If the connection is broken before then, they fail to earn the 
full benefits of rest.

Risen do not rest easily, and to heal Aggravated damage 
in this fashion, the player must make a Stamina roll (difficulty 

ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS

There are always rumors of wraiths who’ve 
learned to Rise in bodies not their own. These 
have never been corroborated and according to 
the Hierarchy and the heads of the Puppeteers’ 
Guild, are purest fiction. So, too, are stories of 
mortal scientists concocting cloned bodies that 
a  Risen  can  leap  into  in  sequence,  or  strange 
mechanical bodies that, with a little help from an 
Artificer, can produce the mechanical equivalent 
of a Risen. Anyone who believes these stories, 
according to Hierarchy sources, is at best deluded. 

But those stories sure are persistent.

7), regaining 1 Corpus level for each success. This roll cannot 
be botched, but a failure means the wraith’s obsession is too 
strong to allow him to rest and that the attempt to Slumber 
must be abandoned for an hour.
Traveling Between Worlds

Some  Risen  can  travel  between  the  Shadowlands  and 
Skinlands, but it isn’t easy given the dangers that await the 
character. To return to Shadowlands, the Risen should hide her 
body somewhere safe (and preferably cold) since it will start 
decomposing again once Psyche and Shadow are reunited on 
the other side of the Shroud. The journey requires a point of 
Willpower and 1 Pathos, and then a Willpower roll (difficulty 
7).  If  successful,  the  newly  returned  wraith  gains  a  point  of 
temporary Angst. If botched, the Risen gets the Angst and stays 
in the Skinlands, and cannot try again for another 24 hours 
unless he spends an additional Willpower point to overcome 
the restriction.

Returning to the Skinlands, however, is trickier. To once 
again take up her mortal shell, the wraith must Skinride the 
corpse through a Dexterity + Puppetry roll (difficulty 5) and a 
Willpower roll (difficulty 8) after spending a Willpower point 
to tear through the Shroud. Failing the Willpower roll switches 
the Psyche with the Shadow in their respective vessels, while 
a botch means the attempt fails and the Shadow gains a point 
of temporary Angst.

While an already Risen wraith doesn’t need to return to 
the  Labyrinth,  she  must  still  negotiate  with  the  Shadow  to 
reanimate her body. The Shadow gets a second chance at the 
bargaining table, and depending on how matters went the last 
time, it may have new and bigger demands.

The Conflicting Issues

A Risen chronicle or series of sessions forces the Storyteller 
to confront a number of conflicting issues that work against the 
players’ group and the characters’ Circle. Left unaddressed, they 

400

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

can derail a chronicle. Alternately, if taken on, they can add more 
depth to the story and offer unexpected roleplaying opportunities.
Solo versus the Circle

At its heart, becoming Risen is about a driving obsession 
to return to the land of the living to deal with an issue. The 
obsession is often personal, however, which means it applies 
to one character but not all of them. The Circle may agree to 
shoulder the risk together, but it still becomes the story of one 
wraith whose agenda takes priority over everyone else’s.

Fortunately, there are several options for dealing with this 
issue. The simplest for a Circle of Risen who work together is 
that  their  obsession  is  shared  —  they  were  all  killed  by  the 
same person, or they all want to bring down a particular crime 
syndicate. Alternately, they wraiths are horse trading, everyone 
else agreeing to help the Risen in exchange for that one wraith 
taking care of their business as well in the Skinlands. And then 
there’s old fashioned treachery, as one or more members of the 
Circle are looking to get the wraith Risen for some nefarious goal 
of their own. What’s important is that one character’s agenda 
doesn’t subvert everyone else’s play experience. There should 
be a reason for other wraiths to support one of their number 
going Risen, and more for them to do than just watch and wait.
Short Term Versus Long Term

Depending on the length of the chronicle, the obsession 
can be longstanding or something easily managed. Games that 
focus on the wraith side of things may consider a short-term 
obsession  that  can  be  readily  solved.  Those  that  are  Risen-
centric, however, will likelier have longer-term goals. 

That said, the Storyteller should take into account that it 
isn’t the type of chronicle that matters so much as the payoff 

PLAYING WELL WITH OTHERS

A presence in the Skinlands affords a Risen 
the possibility to interact with other denizens of 
the World of Darkness, be they vampires, were-
wolves, or even hunters of one sort or another. 
This allows Storytellers to include single Risen 
characters  in  crossover  or  other  supernatural-
centric World of Darkness games, or provides a 
way to introduce the larger World of Darkness 
into a Wraith-centric game. Regardless, odds are 
that the Risen and whoever he bumps into know 
very little about who or what the other is, what 
they need, and what their goals are. This creates 
fertile ground for conflict or even tentative col-
laboration, but at the end of the day, the Risen’s 
driving obsession should never be set aside for 
the sake of palling around with other monsters. 
Some things are just too important to let go, no 
matter what.

to the effort behind becoming Risen. Making the players work 
through all the steps to become Risen also means giving their 
characters  sufficient  time  to  enjoy  the  fruits  of  their  labors. 
Cut their experience short when they worked so hard to get 
there and you frustrate the players. If the experience as Risen 
is short, make the effort less time consuming for the players 
(though the characters might take longer doing things). If the 
experience is ongoing, then Storytellers can take the various 
steps through the process and really make the characters work 
for their reward. 
Hard for the Characters versus Fun for the Players

What the characters find difficult shouldn’t mean punishing 
the players to make it hard on them. Storytellers can’t frustrate 
the players the way they do the characters, but where to draw the 
line? One trick is time lapsing, where the Storyteller condenses 
long periods of investigation and training for the players over 
a single session or two while their characters are engaged in 
the activity for days, weeks, and even months. Are the players 
learning Puppetry? Montage the training session without the 
80s power ballad. Are the players trying to track down a lead? 
Condense the chase to the actual verbs of that investigation: 
talking to people in the know, haggling over information, enter-
ing the stronghold to steal a piece of knowledge, etc.

One way to keep the characters on edge but the players 
invested is the opportunity for risk versus reward, where the 
Storyteller offers players’ characters potential rewards if they’re 
willing to take the risk. This fosters debates within the Circle and 
challenges the player more. Would the characters do unnamed 
favors for wraiths in the Skinlands in exchange for informa-
tion  or  training?  Would  they  sacrifice  a  Fetter  to  convince 
the Shadow to play along? Would they destroy someone else’s 
Fetter in exchange for help? Would they steal something from 
the Labyrinth for an easier way to become Risen? Risk versus 
reward is all about engaging the player to get them to consider 
the ramifications of their decisions.

Chronicle Types

The  Storyteller  has  many  options  for  chronicle  types, 
including some quick and dirty ideas presented here, that may 
offer more unique experiences.
Agents of the Other

Becoming Risen is both difficult and time consuming, and 
only one character out of the entire Circle might be capable of 
crossing over. Rather than split the game down the middle, the 
Circle instead operates in tandem — Risen and wraiths — to 
help the Risen, while the Risen acts as the Circle’s proxy in 
the Skinlands.

With the Hierarchy hunting down Risen, the characters 
might need eyes, ears, and fists on both sides of the Shroud. The 
wraiths can keep other Spectral entities off and away from the 
Risen, or act on her behalf, scout ahead, be the eyes in the back 
of her head, protect her conduit…whatever it takes to keep her 

THE RISEN

401

safe. The Risen, meanwhile, helps her 
wraith allies Resolve their Fetters and 
Passions by applying leverage where 
they can’t.
Stopping the Rampage

A  wraith  known  to  the  Circle 
tried  to  become  Risen  (a  beloved 
non-player  character  perhaps,  or  a 
player character who can’t participate 
for a while), but the process backfired. 
The wraith ended up trapped inside 
the  Conduit  and  the  Shadow  has 
found  a  way  to  take  over  his  body 
permanently.  Now  the  Shadow  is 
on a rampage, murdering people and 
framing the Risen to look like a serial 
killer. Everyone is after the Shadow 
Risen,  including  hunters,  the  Hier-
archy, and the Skinlands authorities 
(FBI  and  police).  The  Circle  is  on 
his trail as well, trying to save their 
trapped ally and trying to locate and 
stop  the  Shadow  from  committing 
further mayhem. It’s an investigation 
and race against time.
Turning the Screws

Things are never as they seem, 
and the concept is simple for a Sto-
ryteller  willing  to  give  her  players 
the  ultimate  twist.  The  chronicle 
proceeds as normal for as long as it 
takes,  but  when  the  Risen  finally 
finish off dealing with their Passion 
and settling their obsession to their 
satisfaction, the Storyteller reveals the 
twist: The circle was never Risen…it 
was all a Harrowing.
Working for the Man

This  unusual  option  works  as 
a  Risen-centric  chronicle,  with  the 
characters  operating  as  agents  of 
Stygia. The Hierarchy takes care of 
all the steps required to become Risen 
short of the pact with the Shadow; in 
exchange, the characters operate in 
the  Skinlands,  hunting  after  other 
Risen  and  dabbling  in  politics  and 
subterfuge  as  they  struggle  to  hide 
their own Angst-ridden battles with 
their Shadows.

402

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

In  addition  to  featuring  strong  investigative  and  spy/
subversive options, this also plays well with paranoia-laced or 
drama-heavy games, since working for the Hierarchy is a double-
edged scythe. There’s the politics of the Deathlords and their 
followers to navigate, there’s the internal scrutiny that casts 
a strict eye on the characters themselves for any sign of them 
succumbing to the Shadow, there’s the Hierarchy’s own issues 
in being marginalized, and there’s the dictums of a bureaucracy 
that hamstrings effort and sometimes forces its own agents to 
break the rules to operate effectively.
Lone Gunman

A  member  of  the  Circle  went  Risen  against  the  rest  of 
the group’s wishes, and they need to shut him down before he 
causes too much trouble. Maybe he’s drawing Hierarchy atten-
tion, maybe the Passion he’s working on puts him in conflict 
with the rest of the Circle’s needs. In any case, it’s friend versus 
friend as the Circle must find and deal with the renegade Risen 
before all hell breaks loose. And if that means that one or more 
of the other wraiths must Rise as well, that just makes things 
even more interesting.
Part of the Puzzle

An overarching mystery ties all the wraiths in the Circle 
together, but certain clues can only be followed up in the Skin-
lands. One or more of the wraiths is going to have to go Risen, or 
the mysteries of their deaths will never be solved. That doesn’t 
mean that all the answers are waiting for the Risen wraiths in 
the Skinlands, just the next step in the investigation. But the 
mere act of Rising can put the Circle on Stygia’s radar, and can 
give their enemies in the Underworld more time to prepare for 
the inevitable conflict.

Caveat Emptor

There’s always a steep price to pay when bargaining for a 
return ticket to the Skinlands. The Shadow is under no obli-
gation to say yes, though it will always listen. And although 
the Shadow’s ultimate goal is always the same (feeding the 
wraith to Oblivion), the stipulations of the deal are done on 
a case-by-case basis. The art, and the devil, are in the details.
The following are approaches the Shadow might use: 
•  Hooking the Customer — The Shadow is a tricky critter 
that understands patience, the nature of risk versus reward, 
and the long game. It offers what seems like a small-risk 
entry into the Skinlands, but with one huge caveat, that 
it can renegotiate the terms of the contract after a certain 
amount  of  time  or  after  the  soon-to-become  Risen  has 
completed its first objective. In short, the Shadow appeals 
to a wraith’s potential for short-term thinking like a drug 
dealer who offers the first taste for free, knowing the payoff 
is in the repeat business. Likewise, this Shadow realizes that 

Risen rarely want to go back home too quickly, and that’s 
when it can negotiate from a stronger position… after the 
Risen’s taken his first taste “for free.”

•  The Denier — Tease, insinuate, hint, intimate, but never 
make hard promises; this Shadow knows all the tricks to 
use a wraith’s own hopeful, desperate, and trusting nature 
against him. The fact is, the Shadow may never say yes, but 
always leads the wraith into believing it might IF the wraith 
does something first. So it sends the wraith on quest after 
quest, waiting to see how long it can string the character 
along. Or perhaps the chance of reward grows stronger with 
each mission or request. Either way, the Shadow is a tease. 
•  Get Out of Dodge — Sometimes the Shadow needs the 
wraith to get the hell out of the Shadowlands because it’s 
proven more difficult to saddle the wraith with Angst when 
she’s surrounded by friendly Pardoners and a supportive 
Circle.  The  wraith  has  proven  adept  at  handling  what 
the afterlife has thrown her way, and the Shadow needs 
to change those circumstances to its advantage. Gaining 
Angst in the Skinlands can be easier, so while the Shadow 
may not immediately agree to cross the Shroud (to avoid 
tipping its hand), it will ultimately yield because it needs to. 
•  Hidden Objectives — The Shadow has its own reasons 
for going to the Skinlands, perhaps to provide muscle for 
a Spectre cult or to go after another wraith’s delicate Fet-
ters. With that in mind, it’s happy to help the Psyche cross 
the Shroud, knowing that it’ll be taking care of its own 
business soon enough. Wraiths should beware of a Shadow 
who doesn’t drive a hard-enough bargain; it’s bound to have 
something else waiting on the back end.

•  The Straightforward Deal  — Pure and simple, the Shadow 
has the wraith over a barrel. It knows the wraith is desperate 
to return to the Skinlands, and it can bluff well enough to 
make the character think that it holds all the cards. This 
means that the Shadow will use its knowledge to frustrate 
the wraith and prolong the process, denying her entry into 
the land of the living until it’s squeezed out everything it 
can. Only then might it finally acquiesce, knowing that 
the payoff of becoming Risen is not all it’s cracked up to 
be and will be the source of further frustration and more 
falls from grace.

•  Appetite  for  Destruction  —  Some  Shadows  just  want 
to watch the world burn. Ones such as these are happy 
to  facilitate  a  wraith’s  passage  back  to  mortal  territory 
because they’re secure in the knowledge that something 
will inevitably go terribly, horribly wrong. There’s just too 
much  potential  for  disaster  when  you  turn  an  obsessed, 
near-invulnerable revenant loose on the world, even one 
with the best of intentions. And when the wraith inevita-
bly screws up and starts wrecking things, the Shadow will 
be sitting there munching popcorn, watching it happen.

it’s inevitable that sooner or later, they’ll cross the path of

in the World of Darkness, mortal humans 
are the raw materials of which wraiths are 
made.  Most,  blinded  by  the  Fog  and  cut 
off from visions of the Underworld by the 
Shroud, have no experience of ghosts. They 
don’t see them, don’t hear them, and most 
likely don’t think they exist. This holds true even for mortals 
who  are  linked  to  wraiths,  serving  as  Fetters  or  the  focus  of 
Passions. For the majority of mortals, ghosts have no impact 
on their daily lives. 

However, there are still plenty of mortals who can and do 
see ghosts, whether the ghosts want them to or not. Innocents 
have the ability to see the Restless Dead. These are most often 
children, and they are unburdened by the strictures of the Fog. 
Furthermore, they have a chance to see any wraith reaching 
across the Shroud; with a success on a Perception + Awareness 
roll (difficulty 6), they can see and hear the wraith, whether 
the wraiths want to be seen or not.

Mediums

Medium is a catchall term for humans who can see wraiths. 
Some are born with the ability, some acquire it in life, and some 
have it pushed upon them by magical ritual or scientific experi-

INVISIBLE PLAYMATES
One of the most common forms of haunt-
ings is the so-called “invisible playmate”, where 
a child’s imaginary friend turns out to actually 
be a ghost. In these cases, what happens is that 
the  child  is  conditioned  to  interact  with  the 
playmate, to the point where they can interact 
normally on every level except touch. This can 
be quite disconcerting for parents, who see their 
child playing quite happily with someone who, 
in their eyes, isn’t there.

ment. The end result, however, is the same: a human who is 
aware (and occasionally can’t get away from) the Restless Dead.
However,  what  humans  gifted  or  cursed  with  the  sight 
do with their ability covers a wide range of possibilities. The 
default image of a medium for many is the fortuneteller, who 
communicates  with  the  dead  on  behalf  of  their  loved  ones. 
While many such “mediums” are frauds, there are many who 
do have the ability to talk to the dead, and if they can’t sum-
mon up Uncle Alfred on demand to talk about how wonderful 
the afterlife is, they probably have a deal with a wraith or two 
who’ll put on a good show on their behalf.

Others,  however,  don’t  think  so  small.  There  are  those 
who  work  with  ghosts  on  bigger  schemes.  The  quartet  that 

406

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

calls itself “The Serpentines” uses wraiths to gather blackmail 
information  on  behalf  of  wealthy  clients,  ensuring  congres-
sional votes, zoning hearings, and business deals all go as the 
client  wants.  Others  use  them  for  more  personal  blackmail, 
and there are persistent rumors in certain circles that an office 
inside the CIA has begun using wraiths as spies on particularly 
hazardous operations.

Why wraiths work with mediums varies. Some do it out of 
personal affection for the medium, whether it dates back before 
the wraith’s death or is a later development. Others enjoy the 
Pathos buffet that working with a medium provides, the endless 
stream of customers offering endless variety. There are those 
who do it in exchange for protection of their Fetters, or favors 
done their living loved ones. And then there are those who 
are blackmailed into it by unscrupulous mediums who obtain 
Fetters and then threaten to destroy them unless the wraith 
does what the medium wants.
Ghost Hunters

Not  all  mediums  are  ghost  hunters,  and  not  all  ghost 
hunters are mediums. Still, there is significant overlap between 
the groups.

Ghost hunters are those who actively go out seeking ghosts 
for whatever purpose. Some want to get evidence of ghosts’ 
existence,  some  are  there  just  for  the  thrill  of  it,  and  some 
actually want to put ghosts down, once and for all.

The most popular ghost hunters are those with television 
shows, though few of the “famous” groups get anywhere near a 
wraith. These hunters, armed with EMP meters, video cameras, 
night-vision goggles, and the like are fond of camping out in 
supposedly haunted locations and collecting data, though most 
tend to wildly overstate their results. Wraiths, by and large, know 
better than to get anywhere near these types, for fear of having 
their Dictum Mortuum violations splashed all over the internet. 
There  are  hunters  who  live  up  to  the  name,  however. 
These mortals are interested in one thing: getting rid of ghosts. 
Armed with technology considerably more lethal than NVG, 
low-level objects of power, or True Faith, these hunters, some 
of whom are outlined below, are on a relentless crusade to get 
rid of troublesome wraiths wherever they might be.
Amateurs

Sometimes, doors swing open wider than expected. There 
are plenty of amateurs who like to play at talking to the dead. 
And while they have no special talent for doing so, the tools 
that  they  use  —  tarot  cards,  Ouija  boards,  candles  and  the 
like  —  often  provide  a  handy  conduit  for  wraiths  who  feel 
like communicating in their own special way. Any attempt to 
invoke ghosts in this manner lowers the local Shroud rating by 
2, and lowers the difficulty of all cross-Shroud related Arcanos 
rolls by 1 for any attempt to communicate or interact with the 
would-be mediums. 

Some wraiths take this opportunity to reach out in friendly 
or gentle fashion. Others have no patience for human dabblers 

and will cheerfully turn a session with a Ouija board at a pajama 
party into a scene of terror. There are even those wraiths who 
actively seek out charlatans and frauds who use these trappings 
to pretend to communicate with the dead and punish them for 
their effrontery.

Secret Orders

There are also any number of organized groups dedicated 
to  interacting  with  and  in  some  cases,  waging  war  on,  the 
Restless Dead. 
Benandanti

There is only one way to join the Benandanti, and that 
is to be born with a caul, which is then removed by another 
Benandante. This rite is called “The Unhooding,” and it begins 
a  student-teacher  (called  respectively  sapienzia  and  novizio) 
relationship that lasts until the infant reaches her 20th birthday.
Key to a Benandante’s powers is her caul, which she keeps 
with her at all times. When drawn across a Benandante’s eyes, 
the caul allows her to see through the Shroud. It’s also useful in 
many key Benandanti rituals, including Ekstasis (which allows 
spiritual projection into the Underworld) and the forging of 
the traditional weapon, the fennel sword.

THE CONTRACT

Certain  mediums,  while  not  “gifted,”  can 
create  an  arrangement  with  a  wraith  to  allow 
for  occasional  contact.  The  interaction  comes 
through a mechanism referred to as the “Con-
tract.” Contact for a Contract is always initiated 
by the wraith, who demonstrates her presence to 
the would-be medium in a way that suggests she’s 
open to further communication. 

Once  the  medium  and  wraith  have  estab-
lished contact, the medium can offer his emotional 
energy  to  the  wraith  in  exchange  for  certain 
considerations, such as being able to sense the 
wraith’s presence. If the two sides can come to 
terms, the mortal gives up some of his psychic 
energy and the Contract is sealed. 

System: The would-be medium rolls Percep-
tion + Empathy (difficulty 8). A success indicates 
that the Contract has been made. Entering into 
a Contract costs a mortal a point of permanent 
Willpower. However, it also turns the medium 
into a walking dot of Memoriam for the wraith. 
Furthermore,  the  Contracted  medium  can  see 
and  hear  the  wraith  normally,  even  when  he 
doesn’t want to, which may be more of the time 
than he anticipated.

THE WORLD OF DARKNESS

407

As a group, the Benandanti trace their lineage back over 
700 years. Loosely headquartered in Lombardy, at the L’Ospedale 
dei Viaggiatori Perduti, they gather regularly at conclaves called 
Raduni. The purpose of the meetings is twofold: to discuss the 
group’s business, and for the various factions among the Bena-
ndanti to try to proselytize their rivals. The biggest groups are 
the Dannati, who view all wraiths as damned; the Redentori, 
who see them as lost souls who need guidance to the next life; 
and the Isolatori, who counsel separation from the Underworld. 
The Ekstasis can only be performed between sunset and 
sunrise. Any Benandanti still in the Underworld when the sun 
rises and the gateway home closes are trapped there until they 
can find another way back. This can take days or even years.

The other key element of Benandanti practice is the fennel 
sword. Each novizio forges his own, in a ritual passed down through 
the generations. Part of the Benandante’s caul is forged into the 
blade, which is hammered out twice: once in the Underworld 
and once in the Skinlands. Each fennel sword has a name, one 
which gives power over both blade and Benandante if learned 
by an enemy. Once it is fully crafted, the sword goes with the 
Benandante into the Underworld when Ekstasis is performed, 
where it effectively functions as a Stygian steel blade.
The Sons of Tertullian

The Sons of Tertullian are ghost hunters in the truest sense 
of the word, religious fanatics who view all ghosts, wraith and 
Spectre alike, as evil creatures who must be destroyed. Brutal 
in their efficiency and muscular in their adherence to hardline 
Christianity, they will seek out those they suspect of being pos-
sessed and torment the ghost (if there is one) right out of the 
target. If the victim dies, at least they die nobly. Members of 
other faiths are not permitted to join the Sons, though there 
have been some tentative alliances with ghost hunters of other 
religions on particularly tricky cases.

The Sons — roughly 75% are male, though the ratio has 
been tipping more toward equality in recent years — are gov-
erned by a council of elders called the Host. The group has no 
central base, but instead operates out of a series of monasteries 
located at strategic points around the world. What they know 
about wraiths is deep but narrow; they’re good at the things 
that will drive a wraith away, but have no idea that there’s any 
difference  between  wraiths  and  Spectres,  or  that  the  deeper 
Underworld exists at all.
The AEG

The Alternate Energy Group is a multinational think tank, 
and one of its branches is known as the Paranormal Research 
Wing. At other groups, the PRW would get laughed out of the 
building, but the AEG has a big enough endowment from an 
organization called the Pinch Trust that it can afford to sup-
port a wide range of projects — and the PRW is about to pay 
off, bigtime. 

While for many years, the PRW worked with what were 
called  Ectoplasmic  Converter  Engines,  devices  that  boiled 

wraiths down to raw Pathos (and which the human scientists, 
led by one Ruby Mather, were unable to utilize), now they’re 
focusing on the so-called Stochastical Extrusion Engine. The 
goal of the SEE is to set up a permanent viewing window into 
the  Underworld.  Based  at  the  group’s  HQ  outside  Rutland, 
Vermont, the SEE is in its final stages of construction, and it’s 
had an unexpected side effect: Due to all the work with ghosts 
at the lab, the Shroud onsite is currently hovering around a 
rating of 3. At any moment, all sorts of supernatural hell could 
break loose.

Members of the PRW tend to be bright, highly motivated, 
and competitive. They’ve been lured into a field that might 
otherwise be a job killer by promises of great pay, great support, 
and wide latitude for projects. All of these have combined to 
make the staff both driven and loyal, and any questioning of 
their work gets shot down immediately.
The Virgilian Foundation for Thanatonic Research

An academic group, the Virgilians offer a unique perspective 
on the Restless. Members all fully believe in the Underworld, 
and they are dedicated to researching it and publishing papers 
on it (in a nonintrusive way). Membership is often anonymous, 
though the group’s board has no qualms about publishing their 
names.

The unique twist to the Virgilians is their publishing arm. 
Not only do they believe in ghosts, they talk to them regularly 
and make a point to reach out to the wraiths of famous thinkers, 
artists, composers, and writers. They then make those wraiths 
an offer: to publish new works in the Skinlands. A nontrivial 
number of wraiths have taken them up on this, and there now 
exist new works by everyone from Sigmund Freud to Virginia 
Woolf. These are sold strictly to members of the VFTR and 
its related groups, and as yet have not caught the attention of 
either the Hierarchy or any human authorities. This is, perhaps, 
for the best. 
The Orphic Circle

A  mixed  bag  of  mortals,  mages,  and  monsters,  the  Or-
phic Circle is headquartered in Thessaly. The group’s goal is 
straightforward enough: to understand death. To achieve this 
understanding,  they  will  go  to  any  length,  including  drugs, 
torture, and the sacrifice of both the living and the dead. Ul-
timately, the hope is that when death yields up its final secret, 
the members of the group will finally understand how to move 
beyond such petty concerns as life and death, and attain a new 
level of existence.

The  Orphics,  among  the  groups  who  interact  with  the 
Restless, have the best grasp on how the Underworld actually 
works, and there is no love lost between the Orphics and the 
Hierarchy. The latter fears that the Orphics know too much 
and cheerfully share what they know with other Underworld 
factions, and there are persistent rumors that members of the 
Orphic Circle have cooperated with wraiths in strategic opera-
tions in the Underworld — assassinations, kidnappings, and 

408

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

other, more esoteric pursuits. After all, why bother trying to 
decipher a moldering scroll from 2,000 years ago when you can go 
straight to the source, kidnapping and interrogating the author.
However, if the Hierarchy knew the true nature of some 
of the Circle’s pet projects, their objections to the Circle might 
get a great deal more active. The so-called Great Work of the 
Orphic Circle is nothing less than the destruction of the Shroud 
itself, once again bringing together the lands of the living and 
the dead. Other projects involve working on reliable methods 
of projection into and communication with the Underworld, 
more efficient tools for imprisoning ghosts for study, and even 
the construction of a so-called “spirit nuke.” The latter is the 
pet project of a young Void Engineer named Xerxes Jones, whose 
intention is to find a weapon that can cleanse the Labyrinth. 
Whether he will succeed is anyone’s guess.

The group counts roughly 300 members in good standing, 
and once inducted, members are members for life — or beyond. 
More than one Orphic has willingly gone to her death with 
unfinished business in order to try to manifest as a wraith, and 
thus give the Circle an active agent on the other side of the 
Shroud. Indeed, there are multiple cells of wraiths who owe their 
allegiance to the Orphic Circle, and not any afterlife authority.
Members of the Orphic Circle worship a being they call 
Diké, whom they believe to be a stern but benign guide to the 
mysteries they are investigating. Some in the group question 
how benign Diké really is, after witnessing its too-enthusiastic 
approval for some of the Orphics’ gorier experiments, but the 
doubters remain isolated, each afraid to speak their mind.

The group is divided into two groups, the Inner and Outer 
Circles. The Outer contains all of the members of the group, 
while the Inner is reserved for the greatest scholars, boldest 
thinkers, and the members of the Ebon Bench, the nine-member 
governing  body  of  the  Orphic  Circle.  Currently  the  Ebon 
Bench  is  in  turmoil.  One  seated  member,  Sergei  Krilov,  has 
gone missing, and the debate over his replacement has neatly 
mirrored the split within the wider group. On one side are the 
Orgiophontes, who like the group as it is. They are opposed 
by the Dikea, who wish to return the Circle to its all-female 
roots, and while the struggle has remained strictly a matter of 
debate to this point, there are those who mutter that Krilov’s 
disappearance is part of a plan to give the Dikea full control of 
the Ebon Bench, and thus, the group as a whole.

Awakened

wakened is the catchall term for supernatural 
beings in the World of Darkness, including 
wraiths.  They  come  in  a  dizzying  variety 
of  forms,  from  bloodsucking  vampires  to 
ravenous Garou, and from mages fighting 
for the soul of reality itself to changeling 
souls in human bodies, looking to stave off 

the slow death that is the Autumn of the soul. 

HUMANS IN THE UNDERWORLD

Humans crossing into the Underworld stand 
out. Literally, in a world bound by the vagaries of 
Deathsight, their condition renders them almost 
blindingly bright. Any wraith seeing a human can 
make a Perception + Awareness roll at difficulty 6 
to identify the mortal as such. As the Benandanti 
cross in spirit form, their auras are subtler, and 
the difficulty is raised to 8. 

Naturally,  with  this  many  Awakened  around  (many  of 
whom may have been responsible for creating a wraith or two 
at some point), there’s bound to be points of intersection with 
the Restless Dead. Some of these moments are intentional, some 
accidental, and some adversarial in the extreme. 

Vampires 

Sleek, stylish predators who feed on the living, vampires are 
like wraiths in that they may be dead but the refuse to take it lying 
down. Unlike wraiths, vampires (or Kindred, as some call them-
selves) are active in the Skinlands, manipulating everything from 
small businesses to the course of history itself to suit their ends. It’s 
all part of the millennia-old war between the elders of their kind, 
which is called the Jyhad. Younger vampires are often unaware of 
this grand puppet show behind the scenes, and stalk the streets for 
blood and other thrills; older vampires view industries, cities, and 
even nations as their prey. More than a few wraiths have wound 
up in their current condition due to vampiric machinations, and 
as such have a particular interest in the undead. 

Some vampires have the ability to detect wraiths based on 
their auras, but only if they are specifically looking for wraiths. 
However, once a wraith has been spotted, he can generally be 
tracked as well. Some of the vampiric Clans and bloodlines have 
powers over and knowledge of the denizens of the Underworld 
that  surpass  those  of  the  ruck  and  run  of  bloodsuckers.  The 
sorcerous Tremere, for example, know thaumaturgical rituals 
that can bind even the Restless Dead, while the Venetian-born 
Giovanni are students of the art of necromancy. 

Just  like  ghosts,  vampires  have  a  complicated  mythol-
ogy woven around them that contains equal parts truth and 
legend. Vampires do and must fear the sun, open flame, and a 
stake through the heart, but only a few are affected by garlic or 
running water, and a well-placed stake immobilizes a vampire 
instead of killing it. Holy symbols of any creed or religion have 
no power over the so-called Kindred, unless that icon’s wielder 
possesses True Faith, and that’s in rare supply. 

Depending upon how recently a vampire has feasted and what 
(or whom) she dined upon, her ability to perform supernatural 
feats varies. When they have blood to invest in their powers, 
they can move faster than humans, call and control animals, 

THE WORLD OF DARKNESS

409

manifest ESP, and all of the other legendary powers ascribed to 
literary, mythological, and cinematic vampirekind. A vampire 
who is low on blood, however, has far more limited options, and 
can be pushed into a state of uncontrolled, ravenous hunger.

Each vampire has a statistic called a Blood Pool, which 
functions in the same way that Pathos does for wraiths. Vam-
pires refill their Blood Pools by feeding on animals, humans, 
and even other vampires, and can use the blood thus obtained 
to heal damage or increase their Physical Attributes. 

Arcanoi: Vampires have certain powers called Disciplines, 
which are similar but not identical to Arcanoi. The Arcanoi 
listings for the sample vampires below match vampiric Disci-
plines to those Arcanoi that are most similar. For example, a 
vampire listed as having Puppetry cannot in fact Skinride others, 
but can control their minds. If you wish to be more precise in 
your accounting of vampiric Discipline powers, full write-ups 
of those abilities can be found in Vampire: The Masquerade 
and its related sourcebooks. 
Neonates

The youngsters among the Kindred, neonates rarely have 
more than a century under the fang. Often rebellious, they are 
the vampires most likely to wander into Necropoli by accident, 
and many have the sort of feeding habits, i.e. sloppy and brutal, 
that either create or bring them into conflict with the Restless.

Elders

More experienced and powerful than neonates, elders have 
generally been vampires for at least three centuries (vampires 
in the intermediate social stage are called ancillae), with some 
as old as a millennium. Most are either the vampiric rulers of 
their cities or know the ones who are. The Traits below are for 
a typical American elder. European elders tend to be older and 
thus have slightly higher statistics.

Tremere

A cabal of wizards who achieved vampirism through the 
unusual route of dark magic, the Tremere are masters of the 
vampiric  Discipline  of  Thaumaturgy.  Most  also  possess  the 
Discipline  Auspex,  which  allows  them  to  perceive  wraiths. 
The vast majority of the members of this Clan are well aware 
of the existence of the Restless, and will take steps, should it 
become necessary, to ward and guard their homes against in-
truding ghosts. Others actively seek out ghosts for bargaining 
or experimentation. Needless to say, the Tremere do not have 
the best reputation among the Restless who know of them.

Suggested Attributes: Tremere have Mental Attributes of at 
least 4, with the other Attributes far less important. 
Suggested Abilities: Tremere should have high ratings in areas 
like Occult and Enigmas, and often they have specialized 
Knowledges relating to magic, wraiths and other supernatu-
ral beings. Otherwise, the above statistics should serve as 
a good base for creating a Tremere character.

Equipment: Grimoire in digital form, tablet, conservative busi-

Giovanni 

Tightly  knit  and  not  very  numerous,  the  Giovanni  are 
necromancers  par  excellence.  Embracing  strictly  from  within 
their own mortal family, the Giovanni are both proud and fanati-
cally protective of their heritage. Those Giovanni who are not 
Embraced can still be privy to some or all of the family secrets, 
and often times they will serve the cause as ghouls (see below). 
International commerce and the Discipline of Necromancy 
are the two studies at which the Giovanni excel. Vampires and 
scholars  of  the  Clan  have  been  handing  down  (or  refining) 
knowledge of wraiths for centuries, and no other Kindred know 
as much about the Restless as they do. With this in mind, a 
Giovanni vampire can make a potent ally for a wraith — or a 
powerful enemy, and it’s more likely the latter. Giovanni are 
fond of binding wraiths and then either experimenting on them 
or using them as spies, messengers, and suchlike. 
Character Creation: Attributes 10/5/3, Abilities 17/9/5, Back-
grounds 7, Willpower 7, Arcanoi 5, Blood Pool 12 
Suggested Attributes: Giovanni vampires usually have Mental 
Attributes of at least 4, with secondary focus on Social At-
tributes. On the other hand, it is very rare for a Giovanni 
to  have  a  rating  of  1  in  any  Attribute;  the  Clan  values 
well-rounded individuals.

Ghouls

Ghouls are mortal creatures — and not just humans — 
who sit in the gap between life and unlife. They have been fed 
vampiric  blood  without  first  being  drained  themselves,  and 
thus have remained alive, if not quite what they were. Regular 
feedings of Kindred blood can allow ghouls to live indefinitely 
and acquire some of the vampiric Disciplines. On the other 
hand, once her normal lifespan has passed, a ghoul must have 
vampiric blood in her system at all times, or she will rapidly 
revert to her true age and quickly crumble to dust. 

Suggested Statistics: Ghouls are still mortal, so they should 
have statistics similar to those of normal human beings (or dogs, 
or cats, or whatever creature they might be). A few extra dots 
in Physical Attributes is the most common enhancement for 
ghouls, and some of the older ones might possess the equivalent 
of one or two dots in an Arcanos. 

The wild places of the world are not defenseless. They have 
guardians,  and  those  guardians  are  mighty  indeed.  Endlessly 
fighting those who would despoil or corrupt nature, the Garou 
(as werewolves prefer to be called) show no mercy and ask for 
none. With one eye on the material world and the other on 
the spirit realms, the Garou stand at the boundary, doing their 
best to serve as protectors of both.

The Garou are not the only shapechangers on earth. They 
are, however, by far the most numerous, and they have an oral 
tradition  that  dates  back  thousands  of  years  before  the  first 
human written records. Defending the forests and infiltrating 
cities from time immemorial, they have cast themselves as the 
defenders of Gaia, the Earth Mother. Against them stands the 
Wyrm, the corrupted spirit of destruction, whose influence can 
be seen behind every move made to desecrate the earth. Garou 
claim they can sense the “taint” of the Wyrm on others, and 
they are merciless to those they think have been touched by 
its corruption.

Modern Garou are divided into 13 tribes that stand against 
the Wyrm. A 14th tribe, called the Black Spiral Dancers, consists 
of Garou who are corrupted and who now serve their ancient foe. 
Each tribe has its own identity and agenda, from the scroung-

THE WORLD OF DARKNESS

411

ing Bone Gnawers to the ferocious Red Talons, which consists 
entirely of Garou born to wolves and not humans. 

Powers: All Garou have a variety of shapes they can assume, 
ranging from full human (Homid) to horror-movie wolfman 
(Crinos), and so on through intermediate forms to full wolf 
(Lupus). Always fearsome, Garou are at their most dangerous 
when in Crinos form. This shape can be up to nine feet tall, 
and  is  gifted  with  inhuman  levels  of  strength  and  stamina.  
Garou are capable of healing any damage inflicted upon them 
almost instantly, unless the damaging weapon is silver. They 
can soak most aggravated damage (though such damage heals 
slowly), but Garou cannot soak damage from silver weapons. 
Granted powers called Gifts by natural spirits (some of whom 
serve as totems to the 13 tribes), Garou make effective use of 
these powers on top of their natural ferocity and strength. The 
effects of Gifts range from enabling a Garou to make edible 
stew from literally anything handy to arts of incredible battle 
prowess. Werewolf shamans can also bind spirits into objects, 
creating Artifact-like devices called fetishes. These also grant 
their wielder powers that can be crucial in a fight. 

With their close ties to the spirit realm, Garou can “step 
sideways” and enter the so-called Umbra, or spirit world. As 
wraiths dwell in what Garou define as the Dark or Low Umbra, 
which most werewolves have tremendous difficulty accessing, it 
is rare for a Garou to encounter a wraith in the wraith’s home 
territory. In fact, most werewolves have little or no dealings with 
wraiths period. The main exception to this is the tribe known 
as the Silent Striders, Garou who are keepers of ancient death 
lore. Wanderers and speakers to spirits, the Striders know the 
secrets of how to reach the Dark Umbra and, more importantly, 
how to deal with its inhabitants. Even the most powerful Garou 
rarely make the trip, as the journey is perilous. 

While  they  may  not  travel  to  the  Dark  Umbra,  many 
shamans  from  other  tribes  do  know  Rites  and  possess  Gifts 
that allow them to affect wraiths or even to bind them against 
their wills. More information on the Garou can be found in 
Werewolf: The Apocalypse. 

The sample statistics below are for a Silent Strider capable 
of journeying to the Dark Umbra. It should be noted that any 
werewolf  who  reaches  the  Underworld  is  likely  to  be  quite 
powerful, even by Garou standards.

Special Rules: Garou are capable of switching back and 
forth  between  wolf  and  human  forms.  However,  for  combat 
and other purposes, they can take on the intermediate Crinos 
form, which is essentially a nine-foot tall wolfman. In Crinos 

form, a werewolf adds three dots to all Physical Attributes, has 
claws and teeth that do aggravated damage, can regenerate one 
health level per turn (except for damage caused by silver, fire, 
magic, or the teeth and claws of a supernatural entity), and is 
immune to dice pool penalties for being wounded. Humans who 
view one of these nine-foot monsters, or indeed any Garou in 
Crinos, usually fall into delirious fright. The effect, which is 
similar to the Fog, is known as the Delirium. 

Mages 

The reality of the World of Darkness is not static. Certain 
mortals, Awakened individuals collectively known as mages, can 
rework the fabric of reality itself in ways great and small. Mages 
divided into four factions in what was called The Ascension 
War, an endless struggle for the soul of consensual reality. How 
a given mage views and deals with wraiths depends in large part 
on where the mage stands in relation to this conflict. Regardless, 
there are enough mages capable of reaching across the Shroud 
with their powers that it pays for a wraith to be polite when 
dealing with them. 

With the exception of the so-called Marauders, most mages 
prefer to keep a low profile when performing magickal feats. 
Conversations wraiths have had with Euthanatos mages have 
introduced the notion of something called Paradox, which can 
be described as the static reality of the universe snapping back 
to its original form when some hapless mage stretches it too 
far. Most mages fear Paradox, and seek to avoid it by making 
the  effects  of  their  magicks  appear  coincidental.  Showy,  or 
“vulgar,” magicks run the risk of drawing Paradox down on the 
responsible mage’s head, with deeply unpleasant consequences. 
Powers: Mages can call on a broad range of powers, allowing 
them to create practically any effect. Rather than attempting to 
shoehorn such wild power into Arcanos descriptions, it is often 
easier to assume that any mage can accomplish any reasonable 
effect desired within her fields of expertise, remembering al-
ways that Paradox is only one mistake away. Giving the effects 
difficulties ranging from 5 to 8, the Storyteller can determine 
the power of the effect achieved from the number of successes 
rolled. Botches or even failures could incur Paradox. 

The majority of magicks do not inflict aggravated damage. 
The sole exceptions are magicks of fire, electricity, and pure 
eldritch force (also known as Prime), which inflict aggravated 
damage if they score three or more successes (two levels of dam-
age per success for every level over the second). Mages should 
roll two to six dice when trying to determine the damage of 
their attacks on a wraith, depending upon the power of the 
individual magician. Areas of expertise in magick are referred 
to as “Spheres.”

This serves as a quick guide to integrating mages into a 
Wraith  chronicle.  For  more  in-depth  information  on  mages 
and  a  fuller  explanation  of  their  magick  system,  see  Mage: 
The Ascension.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Euthanatos 

Numbered among the Traditions faction in the Ascension 
War,  the  Euthanatoi  are  death-mages  and  reincarnationists. 
The Tradition’s stated aim is to hurry those who are suffering, 
or those whose existence is karmically detrimental, to their next 
station on the Great Wheel of Being. Euthanatoi euphemistically 
refer to their work as the “Good Death,” while others view it 
as plain murder. As the Euthanatoi generally don’t take time 
to explain their actions to others, it’s largely the other side’s 
views  that  get  disseminated,  and  as  a  result,  Euthanatoi  are 
feared and distrusted. 

Most Euthanatoi make at least one visit to the Shadowlands 
around the time of their initiation. For the vast majority, one 
trip is enough. Others, however, find themselves returning again 
and again. Unfortunately, Euthanatos mages specialize in En-
tropy magicks, and use of that particular Sphere has interesting 
effects in a realm where Entropy itself manifests as Oblivion.

Dreamspeakers 

Also of the Traditions, the Dreamspeakers are more sha-
manistic in their approach to wraiths and other spirits. Drawn 
from across the globe, the Dreamspeakers regard the spirit with a 
perspective similar to that of the Garou. While a Dreamspeaker 
will occasionally deal with wraiths, she will rarely attempt to 
destroy or bind one. These masters of Spirit magick can occa-
sionally visit the Underworld, but they dislike sojourning to a 
place where the only spirits are spirits of the dead. 

It  is  a  mistake,  however,  to  view  the  Dreamspeakers  as 
merely a collection of kindly, harmless rustics. Most members 
of this Tradition come from societies that have been displaced 
and plowed under by the relentless pressure of European colo-
nization, often sponsored by the other Traditions or even the 
Technocracy. As such, there is more than enough rage to go 
around among the Dreamspeakers. It is merely a question of 
whom it is directed against.

Seekers  of  frontiers  in  all  things,  the  Void  Engineers  are 
the freest spirits left among the buttoned-down members of the 
Technocracy. While most Technocrats wish to lead the masses to 
Ascension by neatly ordering the world into a tidy place — one 
with little room for ghosts — the Void Engineers prefer the tradi-
tional scientific tasks of exploring and cataloguing what they find. 
Unfortunately, the Underworld is not particularly friendly 
to tourists, surveyors, or collectors, which leads to them con-
stantly bumping up against wraiths with no desire to be gawked 
at, measured, or collected. Furthermore, as the Void Engineers 
continue to chart the frontiers of perception, they continually 
refine their tools and techniques for seeing what ought to be 
imperceptible, like ghosts.

The Others 

Nephandi and Marauders make up the other two factions 
in the Ascension War. The Nephandi are of particular concern 
to wraiths, as they serve twisted, monstrous masters who have 
many goals in common with Oblivion. It has been suggested 

that the things the Nephandi worship are the manifest dreams 
of the Neverborn, evil phantasms given form and strength by 
their dreamers. If that is so, it is merely another testament to 
the sheer, terrifying power of the Neverborn. Few wraiths are 
so depraved as to seek an alliance with a Nephandus once the 
mage’s true nature becomes apparent. Spectres, on the other 
hand, are not nearly so picky. 

The fourth faction, the Marauders, are chaos and madness 
made incarnate in flesh. Those among them who are sane enough 
to have goals and linear thought patterns seek to bring that 
madness to the rest of reality. Fortunately for wraiths, they’re 
not really part of the Marauders’ day-to-day plans, as they are 
more concerned with taking the consensual reality of everyday 
humans and putting it through a rainbow-colored strainer made 
of barbed wire and LSD. That’s not to say that Marauders are 
unaware  of  wraiths,  merely  that  they’re  not  concerned  with 
them at this time. Wraiths, for their part, quickly learn to stay 
far away from Marauders or risk getting wrapped up in their 
endless schemes.

Changelings 

Changelings are strange even by the standards of the Rest-
less Dead. Fae spirits bundled into mortal shells for protection 
against the icy winds of mundane existence, they are occasionally 
capable of seeing wraiths. Despite often having old souls, many 
changelings are physically young, and they have not surrendered 
to a consensual reality that tells them ghosts are nine kinds of 
impossible.  This  type  of  innocence  is  most  common  among 
childlings, the youngest (physically) among the changelings. 
Wilders and grumps, the successively older forms, have generally 
been too exposed to Banality (a kind of Oblivion of the creative 
soul) to buy into the existence of ghosts, even if they once did. 
Just  as  wraiths  are  driven  by  Pathos,  changelings’  unnatural 
existences are fueled by Glamour, a refined essence of creativity. 
The two can often be garnered from the same source, and this 
can lead to either cooperation or conflict between changelings 
and wraiths. Cooperation in the sense of encouraging mortals 
who are generating both forms of emotional energy; conflict 
in  terms  of  a  battle  over  a  scarce  resource.  Practitioners  of 
Phantasm, in particular, often run afoul of changelings when 
harvesting their precious “sand” — pure dreamstuff — which 
can be thought of as another manifestation of Glamour. 

Changelings exist in two worlds, the enchanted and the 
mundane.  The  latter  is  everyday  existence,  and  changelings 
wear their mortal guises when moving in it. But with the ap-
plication of Glamour, everything changes. Changelings reveal 
their true selves, at least to those who are also enchanted and 
can see them. Nor does this ensorcelled version of reality restrict 
itself to revealing changelings’ true visages; dreams and fears 
given form, called chimera, roam the landscape and transform 
it into a glorious explosion of the fantastic. 

Divided into a pair of conflicting Courts (Seelie and Un-
seelie), a plethora of noble houses and social distinctions, and 
a bucketful of Kiths (types of fae), changeling society is almost 

414

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

as conflicted as Stygia’s. There are some basic guidelines — in 
all  likelihood  a  Seelie  changeling  will  be  friendlier  than  an 
Unscelie one, and a noble troll is more likely to be friendly 
than a hungry (and omnivorous) redcap, but with changelings 
you never can tell. Throw in their occasionally head-scratching 
sense of honor, and the end result of how a changeling will react 
to a wraith is almost impossible to predict. 

Powers: While changeling magic is not necessarily as flashy 
or powerful as that of mages, it is a mistake to underestimate it. 
Often requiring a short ritual or an ingredient or three to set 
in motion, changeling cantrips are less about brute force than 
they are about trickery, misdirection, and personality. That isn’t 
to say that a cantrip can’t wreak devastating havoc, but rather 
that a changeling is more likely to convince an enemy to chase 
his own tail until he falls down from exhaustion rather than 
simply zapping him with a streak of lightning.

There are two things changelings fear most: cold iron and 
Banality. The latter strips Glamour from them and drags them 
inexorably into the mundane world, where the memory of fae 
existence slowly fades to nothing. Cold iron, on the other hand, 
presents a more immediate and existential threat. Cold iron inflicts 
aggravated damage on changelings, and whereas death by means 
of a chimerical weapon merely dumps a changeling back into the 
mundane world, death from a cold iron blade is quite permanent.

Sluagh

Unnerving dwellers in darkness, the sluagh are the gatherers 
of secrets and the speakers to the dead of the changeling world. 
Unable to raise their voices above a whisper, they dwell in shad-
owy and cobwebbed spaces, collecting secrets from whatever 
source is willing to offer it. They will often trade secrets, but 
the Kith as a whole places great value on formality and secrecy. 
Suggested  Abilities:  Alertness  3,  Athletics  2,  Awareness  3, 
Empathy 2, Enigmas 3, Etiquette 2, Expression 2, Intimida-
tion 1, Investigation 3, Stealth 3, Subterfuge 3 

Arts: Legerdemain (Arts of illusion), Soothsay (Arts of proph-
ecy and knowledge), Chicanery (Arts of misdirection and 
trickery) 

Becoming Restless

Awakened beings rarely become wraiths upon their passing. 
Even though vampires often have unfinished business when 
they go, the chances of a destroyed vampire becoming a wraith 
are exceedingly slim (though not unheard of).

Mages by and large reincarnate, but some can be delayed 
in their journey around the Wheel to learn some lesson that 
can only be imparted in the Underworld. No rhyme or reason 
has ever been detected as to which mages are likely to become 

THE WORLD OF DARKNESS

415

wraiths, though the Void Engineers have spent considerable 
resources exploring the matter.

might be for a wraith, but it will still be useful, and combining 
Fatalism with Embody will clear things up nicely. 

Garou, like mages, reincarnate, and as such it is almost 
unheard of for one to become a wraith. Changelings are only 
susceptible to becoming one of the Restless Dead if killed with 
cold iron. Otherwise, their spirits are sent back to a new body.
The powers of other Awakened do not travel with them 
into the Underworld. It does not matter how powerful a mage 
was in life, once they become wraiths they are no different from 
any other Enfants entering the Shadowlands, and just as suscep-
tible to its dangers. For that reason, many work hard at laying 
low for as long as possible, in order to prevent the notoriety of 
their previous existences from catching up with them, fatally.
The one exception to the rule is the Giovanni. Certain 
members of the Clan have developed a rough technique for 
forcing the soul of a deceased ghoul to become a wraith. These 
wraiths are protected and cared for by the Clan, and in return, 
they do spy work in the Underworld. 

Note that the ultimate decision as to whether an Awakened 
entity can become a wraith is in the hands of the Storyteller. 
However, having a favorite character become one of the Restless 
can be a good way to maintain chronicle continuity, and allow 
a player to keep playing a favorite character even postmortem. 

Arcanoi and the Awakened

Arcanoi can affect more than just the Restless Dead. Some 
have the power to punch through into the Skinlands and have 
tremendous impact on things — or people — there. Nor are the 
Awakened dwellers in the World of Darkness immune to the 
powers of wraiths. While most wraiths (not to mention most 
vampires, werewolves, mages, and changelings) are blissfully 
unaware of the powers that can be levied from the Shadowlands, 
some Restless are quite aware of what they’re capable of. A few 
cut deals with other Awakened beings, while others go hunting.
Argos

Most uses of this Arcanos are restricted to the Underworld, 
so there’s little interaction with other Awakened. Embodied 
wraiths can use Enshroud, but they cannot wrap others in those 
same shadows.
Embody

When Embodied, a wraith can be affected by other Awak-
ened beings. That includes everything from being Dominated by 
a vampire to being turned into lawn furniture by a particularly 
adept mage. All of these will work on an Embodied wraith as 
they would work on a human. The effects do not automatically 
reverse themselves once the wraith goes back across the Shroud, 
which can lead to some interesting moments.
Fatalism

Certain  Fatalism  powers  can  be  used  on  those  in  the 
Skinlands. The information uncovered will be vaguer than it 

Kismet can be used on dwellers in the Skinlands, though 
it’s often of limited usefulness. Using this art on something 
with a tendency to reincarnate, like, say, a Garou, can provide 
glimpses of other lives, instead of the here and now. Vampires 
are also problematic, as they’ve technically already died. A 
glimpse  of  a  Kindred’s  mortal  death,  however,  can  contain 
some element linking it to how the vampire will meet their 
ultimate end.
Inhabit

Artificers love messing with the cybernetically enhanced 
minions of Iteration X. Even with the high Shroud rating of 
secure systems, they’re still susceptible to a sufficiently moti-
vated wraith’s efforts to hack things from the other side. And 
as most Technocrats flat out don’t believe in ghosts (with a few 
exceptions  among  the  Void  Engineers),  they  certainly  don’t 
build defenses against ghostly incursions.

On the Tradition side of things, mages are a little better 
prepared to deal with gremlins from the afterlife. Any Virtual 
Adept with a Spirit rating of at least 2 can put together a ba-
sic defense against Artificers cruising their networks (Wits + 
Inhabit, difficulty 8 to engage with a system defended thus).

Sons of Ether, on the other hand, have tech that’s easy 
to penetrate but difficult to escape from. Due to their passing 
acquaintance with the normal laws of physics, Sons of Ether 
devices require an Intelligence roll (difficulty 7) to escape once 
a wraith is inside. The imprisonment lasts up to one day. Certain 
sharp-eyed Sons of Ether have noticed their unwanted guests 
and gone into the business of making ghost traps, moebius loops 
of circuitry that can trap an overly curious wraith in an endless 
loop unless the mage chooses to free them.
Keening

Keening is among the most impactful of the Arcanoi when 
it comes to other Awakened. It has a particularly interesting 
effect on Garou, with Mood Music able to steal Rage points 
(difficulty 9) or add them (also difficulty 9). There are even 
reports  of  Silent  Striders  allying  with  Chanteurs,  who  sing 
battle  fervor  into  their  allies’  hearts  in  exchange  for  cross-
Shroud assistance. 

Garou aren’t the only ones who can be affected, though. 
An Embodied wraith can spend a Willpower point while using 
Requiem and force a vampire either into or out of frenzy. If the 
target’s prepared for the auditory assault, he can resist with a 
Willpower roll. Otherwise, no resistance roll is allowed.

Changelings are also susceptible to Keening. If the wraith 
is visible to the changeling, then Embody is not necessary for 
an Art to have an effect. Songs of particular beauty can infuse 
a changeling with a point of Glamour per success. 

Beyond that, Crescendo can be used as a physical attack 

on any target in the Skinlands by an Embodied wraith.

416

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Lifeweb

Soul Interwoven can affect other Awakened, but no Awak-
ened in their right mind will sign up for that deal. Considering 
the level of violence and potential for sudden death that infuses 
the World of Darkness, few Monitors are interested in linking 
their fates to that of a creature who could face sudden destruc-
tion at any moment.
Moliate

Moliate only affects the Restless Dead. Its effect is limited to 
plasm, and flesh and fur remain unaffected even if the Masquer 
making the attempt is Embodied. 
Outrage

Outrage is all about interacting with the Skinlands, and as 
such most of the arts function normally. Or to put it another 
way, a Stonehand Punch doesn’t much care who the target is. 
The Obliviate art also works as normal. As yet, no Awak-

ened beings have figured out an effective defense against it.

As for Death’s Touch, while it can be used to set fires, it 
cannot be used to set another entity on fire. Or, to put it another 
way, a wraith cannot ignite a vampire. She can, however, set the 
material in his pockets alight, and let him deal with that as he may.
Pandemonium

The normal restrictions on Pandemonium apply to most 
arts when it comes to interacting with other Awakened. Blood 
created with Foul Humour will be nasty and undrinkable by 
even the most desperate Kindred. Insect hordes created can 
be irritating and annoying, but not lethal — gnats yes, killer 
bees no. Flesh that is created is foul and inedible, and so forth. 
Tempus Fugit can impact Awakened using Celerity, Rage, or 
time-based magic, not to mention the rare vampiric Discipline 
of Temporis. A vampire or Garou using Celerity or Rage cannot 
get extra actions by being influenced by Tempus Fugit, but they 
can have actions removed by the effects of the art. Mages can 
counter the effect with either Time or Correspondence 3, but 
only if the mage is aware of what’s going on. 

As for Temporis, it is believed that that Leaden Moment 
and higher-rated powers of the Discipline may be able to counter 
the effects of Tempus Fugit. However, practitioners of Temporis 
are so rare that the odds of one ever coming into conflict with 
a Haunter are vanishingly small, and as such no one’s ever had 
the chance to test the theory.
Phantasm

Sandmen routinely deal with other Awakened, far more 
than  most  wraiths.  Whether  it’s  slipping  old  souls  into  new 
bodies for the Progenitors or communing with Silent Striders 
and Dreamspeakers, Sandmen pay the Dictum Mortuum little 
heed when it comes to their Awakened neighbors. 

Phantasm works the same way on Awakened as it does on 
regular mortals. Vampires and Garou can be pulled into Pageants 

as easily as anyone else. However, an Awakened being may be 
able to recognize what’s going on (Willpower, difficulty 6) and 
act accordingly.
Puppetry

Being a vampire (or a Garou, or a mage, or a changeling) does 
not render you invulnerable to Puppetry — quite the contrary. All 
Puppetry arts can be used on Awakened beings. However, unlike 
mortals, they can fight back. If an Awakened being is aware she’s 
being meddled with, she can spend a Willpower point and make 
a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) to attempt to counteract the effects 
of Puppetry. Certain arts, such as Skinride, are almost impossible 
to anticipate, and thus can only rarely be blocked. On the other 
hand, repeated assaults can eventually be countered. 

When a wraith attempts to use Puppetry on a Dominated 
individual, the Puppeteer and the vampire responsible for the 
mind control make a contested Willpower roll. This only matters 
for cases where the Puppeteer and the controlling vampire are 
at loggerheads; otherwise the Discipline and the Arcanos can 
work together smoothly (as is the case with Presence).
Usury

Usury works on all Awakened beings just as it would on 
a mortal. Usurers can steal health levels from any manner of 
Awakened. At Storyteller discretion, the wraith can also avail 
himself  of  Blood  Points,  Gnosis,  Quintessence,  or  Glamour, 
though this requires identifying the target as Awakened before 
beginning the assault, and many of these entities can retaliate, 
making this a risky maneuver.

On the other hand, Usurers can also restore these energies. 
This makes for some interesting alliances between Usurers and 
Awakened beings. 

Dwellers in the Storm

he  nightmare  depths  of  the  Tempest  are 
home  to  more  than  just  Spectres.  Called 
Whistimmu  by  the  oldest  wraiths,  these 
beings are neither wraith nor Spectre, but 
something  entirely  other.  Shaped  from 
the  raw  plasm  of  the  Underworld,  the 
Whistimmu, or plasmics, as scholars of the 
Tempest prefer to call them, come in an endless variety of shapes 
and sizes. However, they can be divided into four broad categories. 
Phantasies are beings that mostly resemble the wild beasts of 
the Skinlands, from cats and dogs to hawks, orcas, and bears, 
though often with unearthly features like curving ram’s horns 
or glowing red eyes. Like their Skinlands counterparts, these 
plasmics tend to avoid contact with wraiths, though individuals 
with  the  proper  talents  or  Arcanoi  can  sometimes  interact 
with them. Deleriums are largely identical to phantasies, but, as 
their name implies, they are malformed or twisted somehow, as 
though shaped in the depths of a fever dream. These plasmics 

THE WORLD OF DARKNESS

417

are unpredictable at best, malevolent and predatory at worst. 
Legendaries are rarely seen plasmics that take their shapes from 
creatures of ancient myth: dragons, unicorns, manticores, and 
more. Some legendaries are benign, others sinister; nearly all 
are intelligent, though their motivations are often inscrutable. 
Finally, there are the wyrd, beings so vanishingly rare that even 
many Tempest scholars debate their existence. There are no 
recorded tales of wraiths interacting with one of the wyrd — only 
terrifying glimpses of alien, unknowable shapes in the depths 
of the eternal storm — but the legends serve as stark warnings 
to those who would explore the Tempest’s outermost reaches.

Description: Tindlehounds are nightmarish beasts shaped 
like  enormous  black  dogs,  with  multiple  snarling  heads  and 
blazing green eyes. A tindlehound is a massive creature, stand-
ing four to five feet high at the shoulder, and leaving a heavy 
trail of soot wherever it goes. Its multiple heads — as few as 
two or as many as 15 — belch gouts of green fire when on the 
hunt, and its corpus emits a choking veil of cinders to blind and 
incapacitate its prey. Most tindlehounds have short or docked 
tails, but some have been reported to possess a long, whip-like 
appendage tipped with a cluster of viciously barbed hooks.

Background: According to popular legend, the first sight-
ing of a tindlehound was during the late Victorian era, when 
one of the beasts erupted from the chest of Henry Tindle, an 
infamous wraith and former occultist residing in the London 
Necropolis. As the story goes, it was Tindle’s vicious temper 
that birthed the multi-headed beast, shredding his corpus, leav-
ing a trail of torn victims, and dripping plasm all the way from 
Tindle’s parlor to the closest Nihil. There are many records in 
the Stygian archives that cast doubt on these claims, however, 
with accounts of hellhounds and kerberoi stretching back for 
many  hundreds  of  years.  It’s  far  more  likely  that  Tindle  was

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

BARGHEST

The terrible hunting hounds of Stygia’s Legions, barghests are wraiths that have been transformed into 
fearsome beasts by a ruthless combination of Moliate, psychological torment, and Stygian steel. Legion ken-
nel masters select the most violent prisoners and subject them to a ruthless regimen of abuse and torment, 
transforming them into unthinking, savage beasts. By the time he is ready to be Moliated into his new form, 
the barghest’s mind is a blank slate, ready for imprinting on its handler and trained to hunt and destroy on 
command.

Barghests are fitted with a spiked collar of Stygian steel — a minor Artifact that compels them to obey 
the commands of their handler, along with a matching iron chain that mostly keeps their murderous impulses 
in check. A chained barghest makes a vigilant sentry dog; an unchained one is a swift and savage hunter that 
lives to run prey to ground and tear it to bits. Barghests typically hunt in pairs (called braces), but the Legions 
will sometimes run them in packs of six or more when hunting large groups or especially dangerous targets. 
Fearless and single minded, they will fight to the last gasp unless called off by their handler. 

During training, barghests are taught a form of Keening that lends their hunting howls the power to terrify 
their prey. When a barghest catches the scent of its quarry, it can unleash a Dreadful Howl, forcing its prey to 
abandon whatever she is doing and flee unless she makes a successful Willpower roll (difficulty 8). The howl 
is designed to foil ambushes and flush prey from hiding, allowing the barghest to run the quarry to ground.

Generally, barghests take the form of large, fearsome dogs, but each Legion has its own variation depend-
ing on their tactics and philosophy. The Grim Legion favors giant, savage mastiffs, while the Iron Legion’s 
barghests  typically  resemble  huge,  long-legged  wolfhounds.  The  hounds  of  the  Skeletal  Legion  resemble 
jackals; the Penitent Legion favors hyenas, and so on. The Grim Legion has also taken to fielding braces of 
powerful mastiffs trained specifically for the battlefield. These barghests are even larger than normal, their 
teeth replaced with jagged shards of Stygian steel for bringing down Spectres and the like.

Barghests have roughly animal intelligence, and are violent and unpredictable creatures at the best of 
times. Ones that lose their collars can to fly into berserk rages, lashing out at anyone or anything in their 
path, while others display hound-like affection for their handlers.

merely one of the hounds’ most recent victims, having caught 
their attention while traveling — or worse, attempting to bend 
them to his will.

Tindlehounds prefer the farthest reaches of the Tempest, 
and  are  very  rarely  seen  in  the  Shadowlands.  They  exist  to 
hunt, and are relentless when provoked; it is said that once 
a tindlehound has tasted a wraith’s corpus, it can find her no 
matter where she hides. Because of this, some legends hint at 
rituals that can be used to summon the beasts and unleash them 
on one’s enemies — but woe to the summoner who fails the 
rite, or does not provide the hounds with the sport they crave.

Roleplaying Tips: Hunt. Track. Kill.
Storyteller Notes: Tindlehounds are cunning and patient 
hunters, savoring the chase as much as the kill. They hunt in 
packs of three to six, using teamwork and guile to disorient their 
opponents and bring down the most vulnerable. Though feared 
for  their  relentlessness,  they  have  been  known  to  withdraw 
temporarily in the face of superior numbers before returning 
to strike at a more opportune moment. There are legends of 
tindlehounds waiting for months — even decades — before 
returning to finish what they began. 

A tindlehound can track its prey even through the storm 
winds of the Tempest using its preternatural senses (Perception 
+ Tracking, Difficulty 7), or, if it has inflicted at least 1 Corpus 
level of damage on its prey, it can home in on its target with a 
successful Willpower roll (difficulty 8). If the prey is a consider-
able distance away, subsequent Willpower rolls may be required 
to reach her; if the roll botches, the tindlehound loses the scent 
entirely, and no further rolls may be made.

The flames a tindlehound breathes burn extremely hot, 
inflicting two additional levels of aggravated damage with a 
successful bite, or one level of aggravated damage per turn while 
grappling. Further, the cloud of hot cinders that emanates from 
the tindlehound’s Corpus envelops opponents in melee range, 
blinding and distracting them during battle. Wraiths in melee 
range of a tindlehound suffer a –2 modifier to all dice rolls un-
less a successful Willpower roll is made each turn.

Angst: 4

Description: An aileron — sometimes known as a storm 
leech — is an aerial predator with a long, whiplike reptilian 
body and broad batlike wings. The plasmic’s head is little more 
than a rounded knob of pseudo-cartilage and a circular, lamprey-
like mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. The aileron possesses only 
rudimentary sensory organs, manifesting as a cluster of small 
bumps above its pulsing mouth. Like chameleons, the creatures 
can alter their coloration to match their surroundings, making 
them extremely difficult to spot.

Ailerons  are  typically  small  beings,  generally  no  more 
than two or three feet in length. Larger examples are rumored 
to exist in the further reaches of the Tempest, some reaching 
lengths of 12 feet.

Background: Ailerons have been a menace to travelers 
as long as wraiths can remember, soaring the Tempest on their 
wings in search of prey. Though not much of a threat individu-
ally, ailerons are drawn to the scent of spilled plasm, and will 
swarm in large numbers around a wounded or struggling wraith. 
Over time, these plasmics learned to prowl the edges of Byways, 
where prey was more plentiful. Eventually, they became such 
a menace that the Hierarchy once deployed specially trained 
units of Legionnaires equipped with Artifact weapons and nets 
to keep the ailerons in check. Lately however, with the Legions 
spread thin, the swarms’ numbers are growing once more. 

Ailerons feed by ambushing their prey, typically striking 
from behind and wrapping tightly around their victim. Once 
they’ve got a good grip, they fasten their fanged mouths tight 
and begin leeching away the prey’s Corpus and Pathos. The 
victim’s struggles draw other ailerons nearby in a piranha-like 
feeding frenzy, piling on until the unfortunate wraith is overcome.
Roleplaying Hints: It’s a feeding frenzy! Eat! Eat! Eat!
Storyteller Notes: Ailerons are mindless eating machines, and 
they are always hungry. They instinctively attack slow-moving or 
injured prey, but can be easily confused when faced with multiple 
targets. Sudden motions or loud noises can startle and disorient 
them, causing them to abort an attack if spotted in time. Once 
they’ve clamped onto their prey, however, they have to be killed or 
physically removed to stop their feeding. Because of their small size, 
ailerons drain 1 point of Pathos and 1 point of Corpus every two 
turns, and the Corpus damage may be soaked as normal. Ailerons 
also possess long, sharp stingers at the ends of their prehensile tails, 
which they can use to defend themselves or subdue struggling prey, 
inflicting lethal damage with a successful hit.

Ailerons are silent, stealthy hunters. Combined with their 
small size and camouflage, this makes them extremely hard to 
detect. Attempts to spot them are at a difficulty of 9 until they 
successfully grapple their target.

Angst: 6

Description:  A  cerement  —  also  known  variously  as  a 
mind reaper or memory thief — is a filmy, translucent mass of 
ectoplasm with a roughly human shape. Its Corpus is laced with 
a fine network of veins and arteries, which pulse hypnotically 
when the plasmic entangles a victim.

Background:  Cerements  are  thought  to  be  mindless 
remnants of wraiths that failed to escape their Cauls and were 
lost to the Tempest, though no evidence has yet been found to 
prove or disprove this notion. Light as mist, they drift silently 
upon the storm winds until they cross paths with an unlucky 
wraith — at which point they spring to sudden life, enfolding 
the Restless and trying to force her into a perilous trance. Many 
victims are taken before they even realize they are in danger.

Cerements steal the memories of their victims. The longer 
a wraith is entangled, the more that is taken, until even Ar-
canoi, Passions, and Fetters are lost. Some legends claim that 
the cerement can use these stolen traits to become a wraith 
once more, but again, no proof of such a transformation has 
ever been found.

Roleplaying Hints: Snare the Restless. Grant them the 

peace of the grave. It is a gift that cannot be denied.

Storyteller Notes: Bereft of their own identities, cerements 
exist vicariously through the memories they steal from others. 
Silent and nearly invisible against the backdrop of the Tempest 
(attempts to spot them are at difficulty 9), cerements seek out 
wraiths with strong Passions and then settle over them like a 
shroud. Most Restless are caught completely by surprise, never 
realizing  their  danger  until  they  find  themselves  enmeshed 
in the cerement’s clinging folds. The cerement grapples with 
its victim; if successful, it then tries to force the wraith into 
Slumber. A contested Willpower roll is made. If the cerement 
wins, the wraith is forced into Slumber for a number of days 
equal to the cerement’s uncontested successes. The wraith loses 
one year of memory for every day she is trapped in Slumber. 
The wraith’s most precious memories are lost first; after that, 
she starts to lose her Arcanoi, Passions, and even the ties she 
has to her Fetters. Cerements can assume the attachment to 
these stolen Fetters as their own, even using them to travel to 
the Shadowlands for short periods of time.

Cerements trap their victims for as long as possible, trying 
to drive them back into Slumber every time they awaken. If a 
wraith remains Slumbering for a number of days equal to her 
Willpower, she loses all recollection of who she is and becomes 
a cerement herself. 

The only way for a wraith to regain her stolen memories is 

to kill the cerement herself and consume its Corpus.

Willpower: 9
Permanent Corpus: 9
Angst: 10

Description: One of the many horrors spawned during the 
last Great Maelstrom, the shroudripper is a melon-sized knot of 
muscle and cartilage surrounded by 10 long, bony appendages. 
Thin webs of rubbery flesh stretch between each appendage, 
creating broad, bat-like wings. Each “finger” is tipped with a 
curved talon that’s harder and sharper than honed Stygian steel. 
The shroudripper’s lumpy central body features a series of orifices 
along its back and rear that are used to spray a cloud of power-
ful acid. In death, the pseudo-fingers curl tightly around the 
central body, resembling nothing so much as a pair of skeletal 
hands gripping a half-formed fetus.

Background: Shroudrippers appear in the midst of every 
Maelstrom, when the storm winds are at their height. Forcing 
air through a series of spiracles along the edges of their batlike 
wings, they are capable of flying at incredible speeds, staging 
hit-and-run attacks with their iron-hard talons and then darting 
away before their prey can react. They are drawn especially to 
wounded or suffering wraiths, and scholars theorize that they 
feed on the suffering they inflict on their victims. Fortunately for 
the Restless, the shroudrippers cannot reach the Shadowlands 
without the winds of the Maelstroms to sustain them, and their 
attacks subside along with the storms.

Roleplaying Hints: If it moves, it’s a target. Make it suffer!
Storyteller  Notes:  Shroudrippers  move  extremely  fast, 
capable of reaching speeds of 120 miles per hour, and can alter 
course up to 180 degrees without effort. They strike from the 
depths of the Tempest, emitting wailing shrieks as they approach 
maximum speed, raking their talons across their prey as they 
fly past, then altering course and darting back into the storm. 
In addition to their claws, shroudrippers also spray their vic-
tims with clouds of glowing acid as they fly past — something 
Stygia’s Legionnaires refer to as the dreaded “Lightning Ride.” 
This acid burns the skin and eyes, leaving its victims even more 
vulnerable to attack. Wraiths caught in this cloud of acid suffer

There  have  been  glimpses  —  a  clutch  of  massive  tentacles 
here,  a  bloated  and  unblinking  eye  spotted  there,  and  even 
quick glimpses of a beak that dwarfs the largest ships in the 
Stygian navy. The sheer size of this legendary creature is more 
than most Restless minds can comprehend.

Background: There are tomes in the Great Library of Stygia 
that speak of the Kraken rising from the Sea of Shadows as the 
foundations of the great city were being laid. The behemoth 
is thought to be trapped in a realm beyond the Tempest; only 
when conditions are right can it reach through the swirling 
mists to seize victims and feed its insatiable hunger.

These enigmatic beings vaguely resemble Ferrymen, but carry 
no weapons save the heavy chains looped around their arms and 
torsos. Mourners are robed entirely in black, though the substance 
appears to have a life of its own, sliding like oil around their skel-
etal frames. Their faces are hidden within the shadowy depths 
of their hoods, and the only sound they are known to make is a 
low, mournful moan that fills those who hear it with icy dread. 
The gaunt figures seem to move with funereal slowness, yet cover 
more ground than would seem physically possible.

Background: From time to time — no wraith can say ex-
actly when or exactly why — the Tempest disgorges a shambling 
assemblage of mourners into the Shadowlands. Their dismal 
wails echo through the Necropoli, warning the Restless that one 
among them has been marked and will soon be taken. Numbering 
between five and 20, the mourners are drawn unerringly to the 
wraith they seek, crushing anyone who dares to stand in their 
way. When the mourners at last find their intended victim, the 
chains that bind them reach out of their own volition to capture 
the hapless wraith. They then drag the victim to the nearest 
Nihil and depart the Shadowlands once more. The next time 
they appear, the wraith that was taken will have taken on the 
chains of one of the mourners herself.

Few wraiths attempt to stand against the mourners for one 
terrifying  reason:  those  who  strike  a  mourner,  even  slightly, 
eventually  become  one  of  their  victims  as  well.  Worse  yet, 
sometimes the mourners come for a wraith’s loved ones instead, 
even those still among the living. Years or even decades might 
pass between encounters, but the mourners always return. They 
do not forgive, nor do they forget.

Roleplaying Hints: When will it ever end? Somewhere 
there is a soul that can free you from this eternal pain. Find her. 
Bind her to you. Only then will the chains release you from this 
torment. Until she is found, you will suffer the agony of death 
again and again and again.

Storyteller Hints: The mourners are forever seeking the 
one soul that can set them free. Though they appear certain and 
implacable to outsiders, the fact is that they do not know who 
that fated soul actually is. They have no leaders; they simply 
have an urge to seek, and a general sense of where they must 
go. The closest thing the mourners have to an organization is 
one of seniority; the group hunts for the benefit of the oldest 
among them. When that mourner has put aside its chains, then 
the next oldest among them takes up the search.

The mourners may be used as the start of a long and difficult 
quest to save a stolen loved one, or they can simply be used as 
a device to remove a Storyteller character than has outlasted 
her welcome. If you decide to use the mourners against a player 
character, you are encouraged to devise a means whereby the 
other members of her Circle can free her, creating an opportunity 
for a difficult and challenging chronicle.

The chains and cloaks of the mourners have a life of their 
own, and react independently to their surroundings. The chains 
are as strong as Stygian steel, and will move under their own power 
to attack a target chosen by the mourner. These manacles and

though wraiths who have encountered them claim to have felt 
waves of powerful emotion wash over them when confronted 
with  the  creatures.  With  angelics,  it’s  love  and  peace;  with 
demonics, it’s fear, self-loathing, and despair.

Angelics and demonics can both be found dwelling in the 
Far  Shores.  Recently,  they’ve  been  spotted  in  the  Tempest, 
with some of the sightings uncomfortably close to Stygia itself.
Researchers from the Masquers’ Guild claim that angelics and 
demonics are actually just one species, and that individual speci-
mens can morph back and forth between multiple forms as needed.
Background: The best guess anyone has as to the origins of 
these creatures is that they were formless plasmics who picked 
up on the thoughts and prayers of the Fishers and gradually 
morphed to meet those travelers’ expectations. 

Roleplaying Hints: You truly believe you are a creature of 
the divine — or the infernal. It is your duty to shower blessing 
or punishment upon those troubled souls whose paths you cross. 
And as for those you speak to, is it not the will of the ineffable 
that has brought you together, predestined and thus righteous?
Storyteller Hints: It doesn’t matter that the angelics and 
demonics aren’t actually hellspawn or divine; they believe they 
are, and that’s the key. Stage entrances for maximum shock 
and awe impact, as the sight of an angel with a flaming sword 
stepping onto a Byway should be impressive as hell. 

Relics and Artifacts

elics and Artifacts are toys in the Cracker 
Jack  box  of  the  Underworld.  They  range 
from  the  common  to  the  unique,  and 
their effects run the gamut from incredibly 
beneficial to terrifyingly malign.

Not all Artifacts and relics have special 
powers. A relic pistol that still fires relic bul-
lets is quite useful, as is a relic knife that keeps its edge. Likewise, 
a soul hammered into an ashtray is technically an Artifact, even 
if it is good for nothing except grinding out soulfire cigarettes. 
But the ones listed below do have some unique abilities above 
and beyond the obvious. 

The main difference between Artifacts and relics is their origin. 
Relics are or are based on objects that were originally in the Skin-
lands and then crossed over, while Artifacts are 100% products of 
the Underworld. Artifacts tend to be more durable, but no wraith 
in her right mind is going to refuse a useful relic if one is offered.

Relics
Avery’s Sweets (Level 1 Relic)

When the beloved Avery’s Sweet Shoppe burned to the 
ground in 1957, a surprising amount of the store’s wares came 
across the Shroud. While the idea of relic candy is laughable to 
some, nobody refuses one of Avery’s sweets when they’re offered.

The sweets are exactly that — candies in shockingly bright 
wrappers  of  red,  blue,  pink,  green,  and  yellow.  They  remain 
incredibly sweet, and any wraith — or Spectre — who eats one 
is immediately overwhelmed by a feeling of warm nostalgia. 
Functionally, this translates to 2 additional points of Pathos 
being granted to the wraith for as long as the sweet lasts (one 
scene). When the candy’s gone, so is the Pathos.

Far more of these candies have popped up in the Underworld 
than one would think a single candy store could hold. This has 
led to the popular belief that Hiram Avery himself now roams 
the Shadowlands, and that he’s mastered the art of postmortem 
confectionery for some unknown end.
Thornstick (Level 2 Relic)

Thousands of these relics litter the Underworld. Derived from 
any manner of club or baton that was particularly beloved of its 
owner and used for ill intent, in relic form these riot batons and 
nightsticks sprout thick coats of razor-sharp thorns on the busi-
ness end. Thus equipped, they do an additional two dice worth of 
damage on every successful hit. Should a blow from a Thornstick 
be parried by another Thornstick, however, both will immediately 
lose both their thorns and the bonus said thorns provided.
Slumberbook (Level 2 Relic)

Derived from favorite bedtime storybooks, Slumberbooks 
are  instruments  of  peace  in  the  conflict-riven  Underworld. 
When read out loud to an audience of up to 10 wraiths, the 
story contained within soothes and calms the listeners’ Shadows 
to the point where they lose a point of temporary Angst. Any 
additional listeners feel no effect. 

Once a wraith has had a Slumberbook read to her, she can 
only receive benefits from that specific book. Hearing a differ-
ent Slumberbook read to her will actually give her Shadow an 
additional temporary Angst point. 

A Slumberbook can be used once per day. Any attempt to 
use it more frequently than that will cause the book to crumble 
to dust.
Old Glory (Level 3 Relic)

The tattered remains of a battle flag, Old Glory does not 
show one country or movement’s colors. Rather, it endlessly 
cycles, bouncing from a Civil War regimental flag one moment 
to the Tricolor the next, to the Jolly Roger. Supposedly it has 
never shown the same flag twice, though when it is unfurled, 
anyone watching it is missing the point.

For Old Glory is a battle flag, one that inspires all who fight 
under it to feats beyond what they might have thought them-
selves capable of. While Old Glory is flying, everyone fighting 
on its side gets an additional +2 on all Willpower rolls, and 1 
point of Pathos. These benefits vanish once the flag is furled.
Furling Old Glory after the fight is over is generally a good 
idea. If it’s kept flying for more than one scene, anyone fighting 
on its side will go looking for a fight, inspired perhaps a little 
too much to seek blood and glory.

424

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

It is rumored that for years, Old Glory resided in the armory 
of the Smiling Lord, but that it was recently stolen. It is further 
suggested  that  the  Deathlord  is  very  interested  in  getting  it 
back, and will no doubt reward anyone who returns it to him.
Sweeney’s Pride (Level 4 Relic)

This unassuming straight razor, with a finely honed blade 
and  mother-of-pearl  inlay  in  the  oak  handle,  appears  fairly 
innocuous. However, it has claimed far more than its share of 
wraiths over the three centuries it’s existed. Passed from hand 
to  hand  and  owner  to  owner,  the  razor,  sarcastically  named 
Sweeney’s Pride, gives its wielder 2 additional points in Strength 
while she’s wielding it. The razor also does aggravated damage, 
and it bestows 5 Pathos on its owner whenever her work with 
the blade drops someone into a Harrowing.

Any wraith slashed into a Harrowing by Sweeney’s Pride 
who then escapes acquires a new Passion: “Destroy the razor’s 
owner and take it for my own (Obsession 4).” Once the razor 
is  acquired,  this  Passion  is  considered  Resolved,  and  a  new 
one takes its place: “Keep the razor happy (Bloodlust 4).” This 
Passion is also acquired by anyone picking up the razor.  If the 
razor is somehow taken away from the owner, he immediately 
loses the latter Passion and reacquires the former. 

According to legend, Sweeney’s Pride is indestructible. This 
may or may not be the case, but what is known is that none 
of its wielders have wished to risk losing it. Scores of wraiths, 
former wielders who were stripped of their possession by force or 
guile, prowl the Underworld, looking for the chance to reclaim 
what they all think is rightfully theirs.
Emperor’s Nightingale (Level 5 Relic)

A cunningly crafted clockwork bird dating back to the glory 
days of Athens, the nightingale has been thoroughly and repeatedly 
reworked. Now sporting a coat of precious gems and endless improve-
ments to its articulation, it has also acquired a most peculiar power. 
Namely, the owner of the nightingale can infuse the bird with 2 
points of Pathos and whisper the name of something, or someplace, 
or someone, that he wants found. The bird will immediately take 
flight and head for the requested target. It flies at a slow, but steady 
and unbroken pace so that its owner can follow, though anyone 
using the nightingale must be prepared for rough travel. The bird 
will literally go to the ends of the Underworld as needed to find its 
target, whether that be the Far Shores or the heart of the Labyrinth.
Once  the  nightingale  arrives  at  its  destination,  it  deac-
tivates and patiently waits to be reclaimed. If the owner does 
not arrive with it, though, or shortly thereafter, it will consider 
itself abandoned and start chirping in hopes of attracting a new 
owner, one who will hopefully treat it better.

Artifacts
Bell of Summoning (Level 1 Artifact)

Imported from the Jade Empire, this item resembles a small 
jade bell and hammer. Wraiths may choose to invest as many 

points of Pathos into the bell as they want. Thereafter, any time 
the bell is struck, any wraith who still has Pathos invested in 
the bell will be able to hear the summons and answer it, in-
stantly aware of the bell’s location. Each time the bell is rung, 
one Pathos point a wraith has invested in the bell dissipates. 
The bell rings one minute for each wraith who’s invested in it, 
and it rings indiscriminately. Everyone who’s put Pathos in the 
bell hears the summons, and it cannot be tailored for just one 
listener. Once a wraith’s charge of Pathos is expended, she can 
no longer hear the bell when it is rung, even if she is standing 
right next to it.
Masks (Level 1 Artifact)

As noted on p. 47, most masks are symbolic of the offices 
the  wearer  holds.  The  most  bedraggled  looking  ragamuffin 
wearing the mask of an Anacreon will automatically receive 
the respect due that office. As such, there is a thriving black 
market in both stolen and counterfeit masks. A good forgery 
can get a wraith into a Citadel unquestioned, though it may 
not get him out again.

By and large, masks are highly stylized in ways that align 
with their wearer’s role. Barghest trainers’ masks have a hound-
like cast to them, while grinning skulls form the basis for most 
masks worn by Grim Legionnaires. Official masks also somehow 
seem to magically adjust themselves to their wearer. They’re 
always a perfect fit, even if stolen.
Instant Nihil (Level 2 Artifact)

A favorite among criminals, Renegades, and Legionnaires 
at isolated outposts, Instant Nihils look like glass bottles full 
of ink. They’re fragile and must be handled carefully lest they 
break,  but  when  activated  (which  is  to  say,  broken),  within 
one turn they produce a Nihil six feet wide. A wraith in close 
pursuit of the user of the Instant Nihil must make a Dexterity 
+ Athletics roll (difficulty 7) to avoid falling in and winding 
up  in  the  Tempest.  Conversely,  a  non-Harbinger  who  finds 
himself cornered might use one to facilitate his escape from a 
tight situation. 

The Hierarchy’s official stance on Instant Nihils is that 
they should only be used in direst emergency. The Nihils they 
create tend to linger for a week or two, rendering areas less than 
safe to travel through. Also, for whatever reason, they attract 
the attention of Shades, which can be problematic for anyone 
who dives or falls in.

Nobody  knows  where  Instant  Nihils  come  from.  Some 
speculate that the Ferrymen make them as byproducts of some 
research, while others claim a Spectral origin in the Labyrinth. 
What is known is that they are easily accessible on any Ne-
cropolis’ black market, and any wraith even the slightest bit 
connected can obtain one with no trouble.
Redeyes (level 2 Artifact)

Beacons used for setting waypoints in the trackless Tempest, 
Redeyes earned their name when a Legionnaire sardonically 

THE WORLD OF DARKNESS

425

noted that from a distance, they were dead ringers for the eyes 
of the dreaded Nephwrack, General Coldheart. The fact that 
said Legionnaire disappeared three days later is widely seen 
as proof that he may have been a little too close to the truth.
A pair of soulfire torches in relic glass spheres, Redeyes 
blaze with a light that can be seen up to a mile away through 
the froth and churn of the Tempest. Each set of Redeyes is 
rated to last a full year, and at least one set is carried by each 
Legionnaire on patrol in the storm itself. When released into 
the Tempest, a set of Redeyes hovers in position until the 
soulfire  crystals  powering  the  lanterns  burn  out.  They  are 
useful for marking patrol routes for wraiths detailed to the 
Tempest, search-and-rescue teams, and work details caught 
far from a Byway.

There is no cost to activating a set of Redeyes. However, 
breaking the relic glass that houses the torches effectively 
extinguishes them.
Scribbler’s Pen (Level 2 Artifact)

Gifts from Nhudri to the keepers of the Great Library, 
Scribbler’s Pens let a wraith transcribe the words that otherwise 
would have gone unspoken. Trained in its use, a wraith can use 
the pen to write down either Pathos or Angst, transforming 
it into words of either shimmering silver or inky black that 
never appear to dry. 

An  hour  spent  with  the  pen  will  let  a  trained  wraith 
transcribe 1 point of Pathos to parchment, in the form of 
words  relating  to  one  of  the  wraith’s  Passions.  Two  hours 
allows  the  same  for  temporary  Angst,  though  these  words 
relate to Dark Passions instead. 

A wraith must be very careful with the parchments on 
which he uses the Scribbler’s Pen. Any wraith reading them 
gains immediate insight into the wraith’s personality (+2 on 
all rolls involving Manipulation). Furthermore, if the parch-
ments are destroyed, all the emotion stored comes rushing 
back to the wraith immediately. There are some wraiths who 
spend hours painstakingly creating “Pathos shots” in the form 
of papers designed to be destroyed at opportune moments, 
such that the owner gets an immediate boost of emotional 
energy. This remains a risky strategy, however, and more than 
one hoarder of this sort has had the plan backfire when all the 
parchments fall into enemy hands and are destroyed at once.
Soulfire Mask (Level 2 Artifact)

Not every mask is just a symbol. Certain Hierarchs have 
combined symbology with deadly practicality. Designed for 
use as weapons, these masks, which are largely the property 
of high-ranking Hierarchs, sport an arrangement of soulfire 
crystals (on average, 10 Pathos points’ worth). When acti-
vated, the mask can belch out a tongue of flame (Dexterity + 
Firearms, difficulty 6) that inflicts (4 + number of successes) 
dice for every point of Pathos expended. Alternately, it can 
surround its wearer with a blazing aura that can absorb 2 dice 
worth of damage for every Pathos point spent. 

426

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Soulfire Lantern (Level 2 Artifact)

Rather than illuminate, this lantern shrouds its holder in shad-
ows, hiding her from sight. The lantern’s light is a 10-Pathos soulfire 
shard. When the user activates the crystal, a point of stored Pathos 
is consumed and the lantern and its wielder vanish from sight. All 
that’s visible is a dim, bobbing light that, curiously enough, is also 
visible across the Shroud. While the lantern is in use, the holder is 
at -2 difficulty for all Stealth-related rolls. The effects of the lantern 
last one scene per Pathos, and it can be recharged when its soulfire 
crystal is emptied. Wraiths using the lantern can see normally. Note 
that the effect works only as long as the lantern is held aloft by its 
user. Should she drop or set down the lamp, the effect immediately 
ends and both lantern and lantern owner become visible.
Star of the East (Level 2 Artifact)

Looking like nothing so much as a Christmas-tree orna-
ment made from spun sugar, the Star of the East is considered 
an eccentric affectation by some, a lifesaving tool by others. 
When inactive, it will maintain an irregular orbit around its 
owner’s head. Once activated with a point of Pathos, however, 
the star immediately flies off in the direction of the most press-
ing danger facing the wraith. If the threat is within 10 yards, 
the star will hover over it. Otherwise, it will hold position in 
the direction of the threat for a full hour before needing to be 
recharged, or returning to its normal orbit.

Stars of the East must be attuned to their owners. This 
requires the investiture of 3 points of Pathos and 1 of Willpower. 
The star must also be held in the hand of a wraith seeking to 
attune it for 24 consecutive hours. Any break, and the wraith 
has to start again.

Stars are most commonly found in the Shadowlands. No-
body knows what their origin is, or why they’re found there. 
A free-floating star can be caught by a wraith who makes a 
Dexterity + Athletics roll (difficulty 8) and a Strength check 
(difficulty 7). A failure means the star escaped; a botch means 
the wraith broke it. A Star of the East has only 2 Corpus and 
cannot be repaired once it has been damaged or broken.
Candelabra of Souls (Level 3 Artifact)

As evil as it is sought after, the candelabra appears to be 
a gracefully crafted work in polished brass. Each one has nine 
branches,  with  a  variable  number  of  arms  coming  off  each 
branch, and each arm ends in a sconce for a fat candle, into 
which a wraith Moliated into candle form is meant to be set 
and set alight.

When  a  soulfire  crystal  touches  the  tip  of  one  of  these 
candles, it immediately begins burning. When all of the candles 
have been set alight, they begin to break down into raw Pas-
sion. One point of Corpus per candle per hour is transformed 
into a haze of ambient Pathos that fills the room. Each candle 
possesses between 7 and 10 Corpus, so they can burn for quite 
some time before needing to be replaced. As soon as one candle 
gutters out, however, the candelabra’s effect fades.

These items are thought of as decadent and cruel, which is 
why they’re mandatory accessories for most high-end Stygian 
parties. The price of the candles with which to stock a cande-
labra is exorbitant, but the effect it produces is such that many 
wraiths will gladly pay it.
eMap (Level 3 Artifact)

It’s easier than it looks for an Artificer to get lost on the 
Electron Highway, particularly one who is young and inexpe-
rienced with Inhabit. Without proper guidance or a lot of luck, 
it’s easy to run smack into a dead end or wind up miles from 
the intended destination. 

Which is why the Artificers’ Guild, ever practical, created 
eMaps. Sheets of hammered souls, they glisten bright green, 
and  somehow  manage  to  map  the  entire  Electron  Highway. 
Capable of being folded up like an earthly road map, the eMap 
waits for its owner to visualize her destination, then maps the 
shortest route to it. It takes a point of Pathos and a single touch 
to activate the eMap; once that is done, the route to the target 
site appears on the map as a bright line, one that the wraith 
can follow all the way there.
Stygian Steel Armor (Level 3 Artifact)

Not many can claim to own such a prize. Highly ornate 
and often decorated with crests and other seemingly nonfunc-
tional elements, the armor is actually quite serviceable. Each 
suit is different, ranging from expansions of hoplite armor to 
full-blown medieval plate mail. What matters is that in each 
case, the wearer’s torso is protected. 

Stygian  steel  armor  can  take  10  full  levels  of  damage 
before being destroyed. Suits can be repaired if damaged, and 
some of them have additional powers, such as amplifying the 
wearer’s Arcanoi.
Stygian Wall Flies (Level 3 Artifact)

Messengers and spies, these cunningly crafted simulacra 
of  Skinlands  insects  can  go  anywhere  in  the  level  of  reality 
(Stygia or the Shadowlands) to observe and report, and only 
the sharpest-eyed wraiths (Perception + Awareness, difficulty 
7) can spot them.

By spending 2 Pathos, a fly’s owner can look through the 
eyes of his Artifact, no matter how far away it is. Add a third 
point, and he can hear as well; a fourth allows him to speak 
through it. All effects last for one hour, at which point more 
Pathos must be spent. 

Though they are versatile and wide-ranging, Stygian Wall 
Flies are also fragile. For this reason, they’re generally used in safe 
areas or on assignments where they’re not likely to be detected. 
They can fly at 2x normal walking pace, but can only sustain 
3 levels of damage before becoming disabled. 

A rare variant of the Stygian Wall Fly (level 4 Artifact) 
can teleport back to its owner, though this power is generally 
used under only the most dire of circumstances. 

THE WORLD OF DARKNESS

427

Living Chains (Level 4 Artifact)

Made from Stygian steel, not soulsteel, these chains are 
not used to imprison. Rather, they empower the wearer.  Once 
activated, the chains anchor themselves in the back of their 
user,  doing  1  point  of  aggravated  damage  (which  cannot  be 
healed until the chains are removed). The remainder of the 
jet-black links wrap themselves around the wearer, effectively 
giving her the equivalent of a set of soulsteel armor as well as 
an offensive weapon. At the wielder’s command, the chains 
can strike independent targets up to 20 feet away.

Living Chains cost 1 Pathos to activate for a scene. They’re 
considered to be melee weapons, and offer the user an additional 
3 dice in combat. They can either grapple the target (3 successes 
on a Strength roll, difficulty 6 to break free) or inflict Strength 
+ 3 non-aggravated damage on a successful strike.
Fetterguard (Level 5 Artifact)

Few Artifacts are more precious — or more precarious — 
than the Fetterguard. Appearing as nothing more than a small 
soulsteel box, inside it holds miniature versions of its owner’s 
Fetters.  Each  of  these  must  be  made  by  the  wraith  herself, 
though whether she does it through the forge, through Moli-
ate, or through putting together bits and bobs she recovered 
in the Underworld makes no difference. As long as these icons 
remain safe within the box, no harm will come to them in the 
real world, and even supernatural attempts at damaging them 
will somehow go awry.

The downside is that the wraith must have the Fetterguard 
with her at all times. If anyone opens the box who is not the 
owner, the protections on the Fetters fade instantly and the 
miniatures melt away. This shock costs the wraith a point of 
Willpower for every Fetter represented, down to a minimum of 1. 
To  activate  a  Fetterguard,  a  wraith  must  first  craft  the 
representations of her Fetters. Next comes the investment of a 
point of Willpower and a point of Pathos in each. Then finally, 
the box is sealed at the cost of 2 more points of Pathos. 
Soulfire and Souled Weapons (Variable Level Artifact)

Soulfire crystals are Pathos given solid form, and their con-
centrated energy is enough to do anything from melt souls in a 
forge to powering weaponized masks to keeping relic turntables 
spinning. Distilled by the Usurers’ Guild, the blood-red crystals 
can be used to fuel relics and Artifacts so that the item’s user 
doesn’t have to.

The smallest soulfire crystals hold 1 point of Pathos and 
are tiny; the largest are the size of an engine block and can hold 
50 points of Pathos. Most common, however, are crystals about 
the size of a 12-ounce can that can safely hold 10 points. Relics 
designed or modified to be run on soulfire crystals generally 
have a socket for this size crystal, which can be plugged in and 
allowed to power things up. Such items are called “souled.”

For firearms, crystals can be affixed to the grip or butt by 
an Artificer. Each bullet fired requires spending the weapon’s 

Pathos cost, which gets deducted from the crystal. This can 
get expensive quickly, so clever Artificers have come up with 
multiple crystal mountings and other devices to ensure that 
hunting expeditions don’t run out of juice at a bad moment. 

It is said that Spectres have their own version of soulfire. 
These reddish-black crystals, called bloodfire, contain Angst 
rather than Pathos, but otherwise can be used in precisely the 
same way. 

Skin Artifacts

The first Skin Artifacts were made from the carcass of a 
titanic plasmic, which was dragged to Nhudri’s forge by Charon 
himself.  There,  Charon  instructed  the  great  smith  to  make 
good use of the slain beast, and left him alone to do his work. 
Nhudri labored night and day over the pieces of the carcass, 
finally creating the first Skin Artifacts and swearing he would 
never  work  with  that  material  again.  Never  had  he  worked 
something that seemed to willfully thwart his every intention.
Since then, the term has come to mean any Artifact made 
from part of a killed plasmic. All Skin Artifacts require 2 Pathos 
a day to maintain their active status, otherwise they deactivate. 
To reactivate a Skin Artifact requires a full day and 4 Pathos. 
Any botch rolled while using one of these items gives the wraith 
a point of temporary Angst, and as a result, most Legionnaires 
don’t like using Skin Artifacts any more than they have to. 
Beasthide (Level 1 Skin Artifact)

Beasthide is exactly what it sounds like, a square of tanned 
skin taken from a plasmic or other such beast. The skin is rough 
and scaly, and is a noxious green in color, but it does have one 
admirable quality. When used to polish a relic or Stygian steel 
blade, it somehow sharpens it beyond what it was capable of 
holding before, giving the blade +1 damage dice in the next 
conflict. The effect lasts for the duration of the battle. The typical 
piece of Beasthide has a dozen uses in it before it falls to shreds. 
Bloodwebs (Level 2 Skin Artifact)

Nhudri took Charon’s commandment that nothing go to 
waste seriously, as evidenced by his creation of the Bloodwebs. 
Blue-black netting formed from the veins and arteries of the 
great beast, Bloodwebs can be thrown over a target at a range 
of up to 10 yards (difficulty 6, two successes needed). Once they 
hit, they will entangle their victim and start sucking Pathos 
out of him. A Bloodweb will steal 1 point of Pathos for every 
turn they remain on a wraith. Anyone hit with a Bloodweb 
must roll Dexterity + Athletics (difficulty 5) to stay on his feet. 
Escape requires another Dexterity + Athletics roll (difficulty 
7); otherwise, the victim is entangled.

A Bloodweb may store up to 10 points in Pathos before 
becoming sated. At that point, it glows bright blue and drops 
off  its  victim  to  sit,  twitching,  on  the  ground.  The  Pathos 
contained  within  can  be  harvested  by  any  wraith  willing  to 
suck on one of the veins and arteries of the Bloodweb to draw 
it forth, as all other methods of extracting it have proven a 

428

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

failure. A sated Bloodweb cannot be used until at least some 
of the Pathos has been drained.
Shroudripper Gloves (Level 3 Skin Artifact)

Made from finest plasmic-skin leather and crowned with 
the carefully harvested talons of Shroudrippers, these gloves 
are a deadly addition to a wraith’s arsenal. In addition to being 
able to soak up one die’s worth of damage for each glove worn, 
the gloves also do an additional two dice of aggravated damage 
on any successful attack. Furthermore, they leak Shroudripper 
acid into any wound they cause, making the wound impossible 
to heal for 24 hours. 
Wail Tongue (Level 4 Skin Artifact)

It is said that the Wail Tongue is what made Nhudri decide 
once and for all that he was done working with Skin Artifacts. 
It’s a sliver of the tongue of a plasmic, inlaid with a network of 
fine, Stygian-steel wire. This foul device must then be placed 
by a wraith in his own mouth, where it will immediately and 
painfully devour the wraith’s own tongue. The procedure costs 
the wraith 2 Corpus points (which can be healed normally) 
and adds 3 temporary Angst. In addition, the wraith’s speech 
patterns permanently change, becoming harsher, more metallic, 
and oftentimes flat-out chilling.

Once the Wail Tongue is in place, it gives the wraith access 
to both level 5 Keening Arcanoi, which the wraith can use as if 
he had earned the powers naturally. The wraith can also talk to 
Spectres in such a way that he’s immune to immediate attack.
A Wail Tongue can only be removed by hacking it out. 
Even  Moliate  won’t  work  to  remove  it  once  it’s  taken  root. 
Only the blade, followed by cauterization with soulfire, will do.
Guardian Orb (Level 5 Skin Artifact)

Bulky but incredibly potent, this Artifact consists of a milky 
white, beach-ball-sized eyeball, complete with optic nerve, set 
within a thin circular brace made of Stygian steel. A smaller 
ring is worn by the Orb’s user, behind whom the Orb will bob 
and float. Not only does the Orb allow its owner to see behind 
herself,  it  also  maneuvers  itself  between  its  owner  and  any 
incoming projective attacks. Each Orb has 20 Corpus points, 
and it will move to intercept anything from a paper airplane 
to a careening relic truck. To do so requires a successful roll 
(Dexterity + Athletics, difficulty 7), with the number of suc-
cesses indicating how many attacks the orb can deflect that turn.
Orbs can be regenerated with the infusion of Pathos at a 
rate of 1 point per hour. If a Guardian Orb takes all its Corpus 
level in damage, it splits open and a foul-smelling, corrosive 
humour spills out and covers the entire immediate area.

THE WORLD OF DARKNESS

429

Spectre Artifacts

Spectral Artifacts have but one goal: pain. Created by Arti-
ficers, Masquers, and Alchemists who have succumbed to their 
Shadows and become Spectres, they display a twisted ingenuity 
and a sadistic genius in their design. Lovingly crafted, they are 
then dropped into an unsuspecting Underworld in order to wreak 
havoc in the hands of those who really ought to know better but 
who can’t resist.
Forgebait (Level 1 Spectre Artifact)

A Forgebait looks like an obolus. Close examination (Per-
ception  +  Awareness,  difficulty  8)  will  show  that  it’s  a  clever 
forgery, but most wraiths would have no reason to suspect such. 
The Forgebait will continue to act like an obolus (moaning, etc.) 
until such time as the wraith tries to use it to pay for something. 
At that moment, it will disintegrate into a foul-smelling slime. 
The stink will stay with the would-be buyer for a week, letting all 
who pass know that this is a wraith whose coin is not to be trusted.
Lucky’s Mr. Bunny (Level 2 Spectre Relic)

All Lucky’s Mr. Bunny does is talk, but that’s enough. Ap-
pearing as the relic of an adorably cute stuffed animal, the relic 
has been modified by Spectral artisans. Its voice apparatus, which 
used to spout things like “I love Mommy!” now belts out a con-
stant barrage of belittling insults, barbed put downs, and general 
insults. Capable of walking under its own power (and of following 
a wraith or Circle it’s decided it’s attached to), the bunny will 
have a field day taunting them with occasionally funny, always 
cutting remarks. Even the strongest wraith will ultimately have 
enough, and that’s where the fun starts.

As soon as a wraith gets angry enough to attack the bunny, 
it will start spurting fake blood everywhere, its limbs will detach 
and go flying, and its eyes will fill with tears. It will mournfully 
howl things like “Why are you hurting me?” and “I love you!” as 
the assault continues, and the voices of invisible children can be 
heard bawling in the background. Just before it dies, the bunny 
will say “I’m sowwwy,” and then flop over and disintegrate, leav-
ing plenty of juicy material for even the most reticent Shadow 
to work with.

It is unknown how many Mr. Bunnys there are in the Un-
derworld. What is known is that the company that manufactured 
them in the Skinlands went out of business after their warehouse 
mysteriously caught fire and their entire stock, thousands upon 
thousands of Mr. Bunny dolls, went up in flames.
Memory Net (Level 3 Spectre Artifact)

Skilled Spectres can often pull useful flotsam from the Tem-
pest, but even the most talented have uneven luck. However, they 
can up their odds if they use a Memory Net. Supposedly made 
from the hair and bone of a captured angelic, a Memory Net is a 
golden net of shimmering strands attached to a bone hoop and 
rod  construction.  The  entire  structure,  on  close  examination, 
bears a suspicious resemblance to a human arm. The diameter of 

430

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

the hoop’s opening is three feet, which is the maximum size for 
something to be plucked from the waves.

There are precisely 17 Memory Nets in existence, and all 
are identical. They also have a tendency to move from owner 
to owner at a remarkable pace, as any Spectre possessing one is 
likely to lose it, be killed, or otherwise find themselves divested 
of their treasure before too long. 

When  utilized  properly,  a  Memory  Net  increases  the 
Spectre’s chance of pulling a desired item or memory from the 
roiling Tempest. All Grasp the Passing rolls are at -3 difficulty 
when a Memory Net is employed. As for those inexperienced 
Spectres  with  no  knowledge  of  the  Tempest-Weaving  Dark 
Arcanos, they can still try to use the Net. By rolling Wits + 
Awareness (difficulty 7), then can attempt to rescue something 
useful from the storm.

Wraiths attempting to make use of a Memory Net run some 
risk. They too can try to use the device to pull something out 
of the Tempest (Wits + Awareness, difficulty 8). However, any 
passing Spectre seeing the Net will recognize it and immediately 
go about attempting to repatriate it. Even worse, on a botch 
the wraith will catch a hold of something large swimming in the 
depths of the storm, and will be dragged under by whatever 
they’ve managed to accidentally snag. 
Maggot Revolver (Level 4 Spectre Souled Weapon)

Foul  in  name,  foul  in  function,  the  Maggot  Revolver 
does  exactly  what  one  might  suspect.  It  is  based  on  a  Colt 
Anaconda (difficulty 7, range 35 yards, rate 2, Angst cost of 
two per round, damage 6) with a bloodfire crystal affixed to its 
grip (12 Angst). Rather than shooting bullets, however, the 
gun launches revolting creations called Shadow Maggots, one 
maggot is delivered on each success on a damage roll, and the 
turn after impact the Shadow Maggots begin boring their way 
into the target. This attack delivers an additional die of damage 
per maggot present in the target’s Corpus each turn until they 
are removed. In addition, the pain from a maggot’s feasting is 
so excruciating that the victim is at +1 difficulty on all rolls 
for each maggot he is infested with. 

Burrowing maggots can be removed either through Moliate 
or by simply digging after them through their boreholes, though 

the latter process tends to wound the victim rather severely. 
Castigate 3 (Purify) can also be used, killing one maggot per 
success rolled without doing any further damage to the wraith. 
Any wraith foolish enough to use the revolver receives a point 
of temporary Angst for each round fired. Wraiths who undergo 
Catharsis while firing a Maggot Revolver tend to suddenly turn 
the gun on their friends and allies, or on themselves. 
Bean Nighe Caul (Level 5 Spectre Artifact)

One of the most revolting Spectral Artifacts known to exist 
is the hideous bodysuit called the Bean Nighe Caul. Crafted 
from the tattered, torn remains of various wraiths’ faces, the 
Caul’s components have been caught forever in moments of 
tormented  anguish.  Any  Spectre  who  owns  the  Caul  must 
spend a Corpus a week to feed it, or the Caul will start to feed 
on itself until there’s nothing left of it.

The very things that make the Caul anathema to wraiths 
make it a prize among Spectres. The faces in the Caul never 
stop moaning and weeping, and in combat they give the user 
the equivalent of Keening 4 (Initiate and Common arts). Fur-
thermore, anyone wearing the cloak is gifted with 360-degree 
vision, making him insanely difficult to sneak up on. He can 
also draw on the memories, emotions, and skills of any of the 
wraiths making up the Caul (Subterfuge + Charisma, difficulty 
7, costs 2 points of temporary Angst). A success indicates that 
the Caul has dredged up a useful memory or emotion (negative 
ones are particularly useful for feeding enemies’ Dark Passions), 
activated a skill not readily available to him, or augmented his 
existing related skills by one die for every success made on the 
initial roll.

Any wraith attempting to put on the Bean Nighe Caul is 
making a terrible error. Not only is the wraith unable to use 
the Caul’s abilities, but any attempt by the wraith to use her 
own Arcanoi is at +3 difficulty. Furthermore, the wraith loses 
a point of Corpus per turn the Caul is worn, and the suddenly 
difficult task of taking it off requires a Dexterity roll (difficulty 
7, two successes needed). Spectres enjoy watching unsuspect-
ing wraiths try on the Caul, realize their mistake, and then flail 
about trying and failing to escape. 

THE WORLD OF DARKNESS

431

tygia  is  but  one  among  many  of  the 
kingdoms  of  the  dead.  It  may  (or  may 
not) be in ascendance now, but this was 
not always the case, and it may not be 
the case in the future. 

Over the centuries, every culture has 
had its own version of the Underworld. 
Some evolved and changed and endured, informing those that 
came after. Others retreated back into the deeper Underworld 
when their earthly counterparts died out or transformed to 
new identities. Still others were brutalized, wiped out in wars 
of conquest and aggression, their afterlives falling to Oblivion 
as their Skinlands homes were overrun. 

And some — no one knows how many — endured. To 
date, Stygia has made contact with a bare handful, establishing 
diplomatic, military, and trade relations despite differences 

in outlook and metaphysics. Some are allies, some are uneasy 
trade  partners,  and  some  are  rivals,  hidden  or  overt.  But 
regardless, every land of the dead is its own power.

Each Dark Kingdom has its own model; each Dark King-
dom’s wraiths manifest in their own way. The dead of the 
Yellow Springs (or as Stygian wraiths might refer to it, the 
Dark Kingdom of Jade) would no sooner manifest a Shadow 
than Stygian wraiths would emerge from their Cauls with 
the hun and p’o of a subject of Qin Shihuang.

The journey between Dark Kingdoms is long and peril-
ous. While access to the various realms’ Skinlands are a mere 
matter of geography (tricky enough for most wraiths), finding 
the deeper heart requires journeying deep into the Tempest. 
Traders and Harbingers who know the routes between Dark 
Kingdoms become fabulously wealthy, assuming they’re not 
swallowed up by the storm en route. 

Chapter 13:  The Other Dark KingdomsThe Dark Kingdom of Jade

uled by the Emperor Yu Huang, the Dark 
Kingdom of Jade is perhaps the best known 
of the other Dark Kingdoms in Stygia; trade 
often flourished between the two, and the 
numerous Chinatowns spaced throughout 
various  Necropoli  provided  a  chance  for 
familiarity to grow. The Chinese afterlife 
has been to all observers one of the most stable, populous, and 
rich kingdoms of the dead. 

An Empire of Hun and P’o

Whereas Stygian wraiths view their postmortem internal 
struggles  in  terms  of  Psyche  and  Shadow,  wraiths  from  the 
Yellow Springs use the terms hun and p’o. However, the terms 
don’t directly translate. In the Yellow Springs, the very notion 
of a soul is different than what is taken for granted in Stygia.

Chinese wraiths see the soul as two distinct parts, hun and 
p’o. These exist simultaneously, and conflict and cooperate in a 
yin-and-yang-like manner. Each portion of the soul has differ-
ent goals and responsibilities, and at death they are supposed 
to separate and each go their own way.

When they don’t, what results is a wraith, one whose soul 
is fractured but unable to separate. That very lack of separa-
tion prevents the wraith from fulfilling its duties and moving 
on. Indeed, most Jade wraiths are shocked and horrified when 
their Cauls are removed. 

The hun is roughly analogous to the Psyche. It represents 
the spirituality, or perhaps the higher functions, of the wraith. 
This can represent compassion and love, but also deviousness 
and other antisocial behaviors connected with the conscious-
ness and mind. There is nothing morally or ethically superior 
or enlightened about the hun; it is of the spirit, with all that 
implies. What the hun does have is a connection with the ebb 
and flow of the universe, as this is the part of the wraith meant 
to reincarnate into future lives. 

The p’o, on the other hand, represents the part of the spirit 
that identifies most with the physical remains of the wraith 
and  the  physical  world.  It  is  baser  and  more  materialistic. 
But at the same time, this is the part of the spirit most tied 
to family and to Fetters, and the obligations of life. Because 
the p’o is the part of the spirit that stays and guards the body, 
the burial sites, and the family obligations, it cares not for 
Transcendence or Oblivion.

Of the two, the hun is the portion stuck in the afterlife 
without guidance. It could try for P’eng Lai, Paradise, or Nir-
vana, based on the complete denial of the p’o and its Fetters. 
But many choose to live in Shadowlands, adapting to their new 
situation as best they can.

The Imperial Map

Geographically  speaking,  Jade  Reapers  securely  control 
all of China and extend their reach northwards into Mongo-
lia where it borders Stygia in Siberia. Eastward, they occupy 
Japan  and  Korea.  Southwest,  the  empire  reaches  Singapore, 
Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Thailand is in its sphere 
of influence, but not without its complications. Jade Reapers 
can be found expanding as far as Polynesia as the Emperor ex-
tends his influence, carried by waves of mainland emigration. 
Rumors claim that the western Necropoli of North America 
and thus of Stygia are the next targets of Yu Huang’s agenda 
for expansion, but it is a mystery if those are his true targets or 
if it’s simply fearmongering propaganda from sources in either 
Stygia or Yellow Springs. 

Yellow Springs is composed of a little over 20 provinces, 
which mirror many of China’s modern-day provinces, which in 
turn resemble the ancient kingdom borders of history. The main 
or middle capital is in Xi’an, which is close to the ancient burial 
palace of Qin Shihuang. He now rules as the Yu Huang, Jade 
Emperor, undisputed conqueror and leader of the Dark King-
dom of Jade. The Jade Emperor has at least 4 other capitals and 
numerous palaces throughout Yellow Springs to firmly establish 
an imperial presence wherever he needs one, but the beating 
heart of the empire, at least in the Shadowlands, is in Xi’an.

Each province is headed by a governor who is responsible 
for maintaining the peace and productivity of his territory, as 
well as the Necropoli within. He is in charge of a bustling bu-
reaucratic and security detail to help with domestic issues, but 
will almost always remain deferential to imperial decrees and 
authority. In turn, Necropoli have mayors with much the same 
responsibility and reverence to provincial authority. 

There  are,  of  course,  exceptions.  Willful  and  ambitious 
mayors may only be superficially deferential if their Necropolis 
is  powerful  or  important  enough.  And  in  certain  provinces, 
capitals’ mayors are more responsible to imperial, not provin-
cial, authority.

In the Shadowlands, pagodas are more common than not. 
Modern high rises are starting to creep in, but have not yet 
taken hold. Ancient family homes and commercial stores of 
ghostly mud and wood still dominate behind the ancient city 
walls. Narrow alleyways wind their way through the Necropolis, 
with never a right angle to be found. Outside the city walls, 
where for centuries there was nothing but farmland, shades of 
industrial parks are slowly taking shape.

From the perspective of a citizen in Yellow Springs, this 
is  strange  indeed.  It’s  true  that  times  change  and  buildings 
are built and razed — but for the most part this change was 
always a subtle one. But in the last 20 years the changes seem 
like a cataclysm. The high rises and industrial parks became 
a wilderness surrounding the city and home they know well, 
threatening to engulf them in a wave of alienating modernity. 
Only the extremely recently dead have any idea what these 

434

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

structures are, much less how to navigate through them, which 
gives them an edge on older, more powerful ghosts who might 
normally expect deference.

With a living society and a dead one thoroughly indoctri-
nated by both Legalist and Confucian teachings, a Yellow Springs 
societal unit firmly resembles nothing so much as an extended 
family, and indeed, that is what they are called. Some families 
are related by actual blood, but just as many are adoptive. Over 
the centuries, these family units splinter and merge, though at 
a much slower pace in the Shadowlands than in the Skinlands. 
In the meantime, however, they exercise a tremendous amount 
of power both politically and over their members. A wealthy, 
prestigious family with members in high-ranking positions is a 
force to be reckoned with, just as a new, poor family without 
patrons or ranking members is liable to make only slow progress.
But when you are in a family or clan in the Dark Kingdom of 
Jade, family hierarchy demands corresponding respect. The more 
senior the wraith, the more respect should be given. Naturally, 
there can be family friction and, depending on their previous 
lives, aging patriarchs in life might chafe at being junior clan 
members in the afterlife.

The reality is, being a wraith in Yellow Springs requires 
knowing the rules both written and unwritten in the afterlife; 
a wraith needs the experience and support of their family to 
prosper. Regardless of the family’s focus, wraiths still address 
each other using familial terms (e.g. aunt, older brother, younger 
cousin, grandmother.) It is rare that multiple generations of 
families all become wraiths. But the matter of having a family 
or clan to watch your back is one of necessity and familiarity.
If one is too willful or independent, there is always the 
option of joining the imperial army. Yu Huang is an ambitious 
leader, and his plans for expansion coupled with the Empire’s 
need of souls for the raw material of White Jade is insatiable. 
The outer territories of Japan, Korea, Mongolia and others are 
for the most part conquered and occupied by his legions. 

Not all imperial soldiers are orphans or misanthropes. In 
fact, there are more than a few clans made up of retired veterans. 
It’s no secret that many of the souls of the Jade Kingdom come 
from those occupied territories outside of classical China. But 
as more and more contact is made with other Dark Kingdoms, 
there is a need to defend the realm and expand the Jade Em-
peror’s beneficial rule to other parts of the Shadowlands, across 
the Tempest.
Bureaucracy

Of all the various Dark Kingdoms, ghost stories of the Dark 
Kingdom of Jade usually begin not with the details of tragic 
death of the wraith but instead with the position the wraith 
holds in the government bureaucracy of the afterlife. To be sure, 
not all imperial wraiths are mandarins whose greatest dream 
is of government service. But the bureaucracy is a large part of 
the Jade afterlife. It is definitely a certain path to security and 
fortune, at least for the well learned and studious.

While being well versed in the texts of the 
old  classics  is  important  for  testing,  the  wise 
student knows that some scholars did not allow 
their deaths to put a stop to their works. In fact, 
dying  gave  them  a  grand  new  perspective  on 
philosophies that they couldn’t possibly have had 
in life. The required reading for the all-important 
civil service exam is intimidating and long, but it 
is not restricted to works written in the Skinlands.

The Seat of Empire

While Xi’an is the capital of the empire in the Shadowlands, 
there is a more remote seat of power as well. The emperor’s Jade 
Palace  sits  deep  within  the  Tempest,  reachable  by  the  great 
Imperial Highway which leads there from the Necropolis at 
Xi’an. Here the Emperor spends most of his time, moving at will 
between the 251 palaces he maintains within the larger complex.
Surrounding the emperor is his court, a seemingly endless 
cluster of bureaucrats, hangers-on, sycophants, petitioners, and 
more, all drawn to the Emperor like moths to a flame. The Four 
Magistrates, the leaders of the four branches of the imperial 
government, can be found here, as can the Emperor’s personal 
advisors, and representatives of the more powerful families, as 
everyone seeks to bend the Emperor’s ear to their advantage.

And while Yu Huang is the Emperor, the empire cannot 
function on his dictates alone. It is too big, there are too many 
decisions to be made, and the Emperor’s time is valuable. As 
a  result,  the  Empire  is  divided  into  four  equal  departments, 
each of which has its own responsibilities and rights. They are:
The Protectors of the Prosperous Realm — The so-called 
“watchdogs of the common good,” they are the ears and eyes of 
the emperor. They can go anywhere, make any request of any 
citizen and expect to have it obeyed, and search where they 
will.  Note  that  the  Protectors  are  not,  however,  judge,  jury, 
and executioner. They investigate and, if they find evidence of 
treason, they can make accusations to the appropriate authority 
in one of the other three branches. Still, they are much feared. 
The appearance of a member of the Protectorate can make even 
the most innocent and devoted wraith feel as if the weight of 
the Empire is about to descend.

The Judges of the Dead — The Judges of the Dead in-
terpret and adjudicate the laws of the Empire for the citizenry. 
They  are  the  ones  who  hear  cases  and  hand  down  decrees, 
and it is an open secret that they have considerable latitude 
in their interpretations of the law so long as the areas they are 
responsible for are kept happy and prosperous. Judges hear both 
civil and criminal cases, and can draw upon a nearly limitless 
volume of statutes and precedents in making their judgments. 
The Imperial Army — Technically, every wraith in the 
Empire can be called up for military service. In more practical 
terms, there is an extensive body of soldiers, both professional 

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

435

and volunteer, dedicated to enacting the Emperor’s will on the 
battlefield. Only members of the military are allowed to possess 
weapons, and as such every family generally encourages a few 
members to join up for a tour of duty or two. Furthermore, the 
Imperial Army is a great path to promotion, wealth, and op-
portunity for those that can take it; the Conquered Territories 
are key to supplying the empire with the raw materials of white 
jade, and great riches can be made there.

The  Jade  Censors  —  The  Censors  are  responsible  for 
ensuring new wraiths are Reaped and treated appropriately, as 
well as for deciding all questions of ownership of relics, Arti-
facts, and souls. They are also tasked with cataloging every soul 
who enters the Empire, and they assign the tax duties on items 
brought into the Underworld. 
Entering Imperial Service

The civil service examinations are given once every 10 
years. They are used for both placement and promotions. Those 
who’ve taken the examination multiple times know that it is 
weighted  toward  the  more  classically  educated,  and  heavily 
favors Legalist teachings. Naturally, teachings that are patri-
otic and almost worshipful of the Jade Emperor are mandatory 
knowledge.  But  teachings  of  math,  poetry,  and  Arcanoi  are 
also heavily represented. Ideally, this means the civil service is 
filled with well-rounded, diligent wraiths with wide interests 
and knowledge. In actuality, it tends to favor those who know 
the test’s foibles and how best to take advantage of them

Those  that  do  well  on  the  test  can  begin  climbing  the 
ranks of the bureaucracy. However, the skills needed to enter 
the ranks are very different from those needed to advance in 
them. Intelligence will allow a wraith to enter the ranks, but 
a  keen  sense  of  cunning,  clan  influence,  and  luck  are  what 
allows one to climb.

At first glance, the pace of movement up the ranks can seem 
glacial. Wraiths here cannot rely of old age and death to clear 
the ranks of seniority and create opportunity. For the impatient 
wraith, then, the answer to this conundrum is twofold. The first 
is opportunity in the Conquered Territories. While growth in 
Yellow Springs is slow, there are always lots of positions to be 
filled in the Conquered Territories, both to replace those who 
fail to do their duties and keep their quotas and to succeed those 
who successfully leave dangerous positions through promotions 
back to the kingdom proper. 

The second way has do to with the economics of pathos.

The Economics of Pathos

A  unique  symbiosis  occurs  when  a  person  who  follows 
Chinese  funeral  traditions  passes  away.  The  Chinese  Quick 
have  a  great  deal  of  lore  concerning  dealing  with  the  dead. 
Lanterns are lit, creating a path to the grave and final resting 
place, and much care is taken to not allow the wraith to attach 
to the home as a haunt. Feng shui is used to carefully choose 
gravesites where the wraith can look upon his family home from 
a respectful distance without interfering with day-to-day life.

Offerings  and  prayers  are  submitted  to  the  dead.  Paper 
money known as hell money is burnt, as well as paper objects 
resembling  useful  objects.  As  the  paper  burns,  the  wisps  of 
smoke rising toward the heavens transport economic support 
and gifts to the intended receiver. The objects take form in the 
Shadowlands, but not as usable relics. They rather become raw 
materials that can be transformed into portable, tradable Pathos. 
As such, a great deal of a wraith’s wealth is determined by the 
actions of their living descendants. 

This is not the only way Jade wraiths get Pathos. They can 
get Pathos much like Stygian wraiths, though their Passions are 
usually tied to their families. These familial obligations require 
the wraith to try to ensure the prosperity of the blood they’ve 
left behind. After all, the more prosperous the family, the better 
they can afford to make offerings to their ancestors. 

However, unless you are an ancestor so famous or so re-
nowned as to echo down through the ages, your personal offerings 
are forgotten within a generation or two. This gives the most 
recently deceased wraiths the most access to the paper Pathos 
currency. The currency can be used to help enrich the coffers 
of the family or it can be used to help bribe one’s way up the 
bureaucratic food chain. The influx of new wraiths and new 
currency help ensure a natural turnover in the heavenly ranks.

The Rise of Qin Shihuang

As far back as written history extends, empires would rise 
and fall in the Yellow Springs. Emperors and kings, revered in 
life and honored in death, would establish a kingdom where 
they would rule, supported by soldiers and offerings as long as 
they were remembered. They would induct wraiths into their 
kingdoms until a newer or more powerful wraith arrived with 
their own supporters, and then the cycle would repeat.

Separated by language, by clans, and by generations, dynas-
ties would rise and fall in the Shadowlands of the east. In truth, 
politics of the Shadowlands mirrored those of the Skinlands. 
That is, until the arrival of Qin Shihuang. Known as the first 
emperor to unite China, Qin Shihuang conquered an empire 
and succeeded in uniting all of China under his rule. He created 
an imperial bureaucracy that could rule over multiple provinces. 
He established standardized weights and measures, connected 
roads, and started connecting the walls of many separate states 
into what became known as the Great Wall. But most impor-
tantly, he burned books until the only surviving written script 
was the one his empire used, thus uniting China under one 
single written language.

Fearful of death and of the many enemies he sent to the 
Shadowlands, Qin Shihuang started a two-pronged strategy. One 
was to attempt to prolong his life with an elixir of immortality, 
the other to prepare for his demise and protect himself from 
the dark spirits waiting to kill him in life and to torture him 
in death. Five years before his death, Qin Shihuang ordered 
the construction of his tomb at the foot of Li Mountain, a half 
day’s journey from the city of Xi’an. 

436

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The tomb was a city in and of itself. Rumored to be have 
been built by over 700,000 men, the palace tomb had moats 
of  mercury,  jade,  and  gold,  and  mystical  artifacts  plundered 
from the conquered kingdoms that made Qin’s empire. In the 
meantime, scholars, magicians, and necromancers from all over 
the empire were ordered to study and learn as much as they 
could about the afterlife. 

When Qin Shihuang died in 210 BCE, his arrival hit the 
Shadowlands  like  a  thunderbolt.  He  arrived  with  thousands 
of his most treasured servants and advisors, hundreds of jade 
Artifacts and relics, the magicians and scholars he had begun 
to collect years prior, and the spirits of thousands of his imperial 
guardsmen imbued into living terra cotta statues in full armor 
and on horseback.

Known as the Immortal Guard, these soldiers were nigh 
invulnerable, with unstoppable mystical powers and Arcanoi 
never before seen. Ghostly Chinese kings and warlords quickly 
tried to form alliances to stop this new threat, but they were 
systematically swept aside by clever campaigning and mystical 
might.  From  his  relic  fortress,  Qin  Shihuang  stood  resolute 
against  waves  and  waves  of  enemies  he  had  conquered  just 
years before.

LUNG WANG

During the last, desperate days of the initial 
resistance to Qin Shihuang’s march across Yellow 
Springs, an opposing general named Li K’un made 
an alliance with an ancient Malfean calling itself 
Lung  Wang.  The  great  beast  first  opposed  the 
Emperor at a climactic battle at the Great Wall, 
but when that proved inconclusive, it resorted to 
more devious means. Disguising itself, it lured the 
Emperor into the Tempest, and there the two did 
battle. The Emperor, armed with the legendary 
Ju-i, a magical scepter of True Jade made by the 
magician Fu Xia, smote the beast, cast it down, 
and wrung its secrets from it. Then, the Emperor 
emerged, transformed and brimming with power, 
and once again took up the reins of power in order 
to build his empire.

Or so the official story goes.

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

437

Unfortunately  for  the  second  emperor  of  the  Qin,  but 
fortunately  for  his  father,  rebel  forces  in  life  had  slaughtered 
hundreds of thousands of Qin soldiers in a successful attempt 
to overthrow Qin dynasty rule in the three years following Qin 
Shihuang’s death. Now the first emperor of China could expand 
his control in the Shadowlands at the expense of his legacy in the 
lands of the living. His enemies and subjects of his enemies were 
enslaved so he could continue building his empire in death where 
he couldn’t in life. Except now, he had all the time in the world.
With fresh levies from his son’s defeated armies and the mys-
tical juggernauts that were his Immortal Guard, Qin Shihuang 
quickly secured the eastern Shadowlands in less than a decade. 
It was then that he decided to anoint himself with the name of 
the highest of gods in the Chinese Pantheon. Qin Shihuang 
became Yu Huang, god of the heavens, the Jade Emperor. And 
as such he has reigned, through Maelstrom, war, rebellion and 
even peace, ever since.
The Empire Today

The Empire finds itself at a crossroads. The ever-increasing 
size of the Empire means the Emperor’s forces, particularly the 
Immortal Guard, are stretched thin, and brushfire rebellions 
spring up everywhere. Japan, in particular, continues to resist. 
Meanwhile, the Empire’s demand for White Jade remains in-
satiable, demanding more conquest and continuing the cycle. 
And yet, the Emperor remains, eternal and untouchable, 

secure in his power.  

Denizens of the Empire
Kuei

The  wraiths  of  those  who  were  buried  improperly,  kuei 
are mindless, hungry ghosts. While normally a p’o stays with 
and protects the body of the deceased, when the proper rites 
are  not  observed  the  p’o  can  become  warped  and  vengeful, 
and transform into a kuei.  They are not Spectres, but rather 
something unique and uniquely dangerous.

Kuei rarely stray far from their bodies, the corpse serving 
as their only Fetter. They have only basic motivations — find 
peace, get vengeance on those who wronged them, and find an 
end to their pain. It’s impossible to communicate with them 
on more than an animal level; even the best kuei trainers the 
Empire has to offer understand this. The Way of the Farmer 
Arcanos can be used to control kuei, but beyond that, they can 
only understand simple orders.

Kuei often organize into packs, and their teeth and claws 
make these groups fearsomely dangerous to lone wraiths wan-
dering in their territory. Captured kuei are sometimes turned 
into the equivalent of barghests. These creatures, now called 
kuei-go or “bad dogs,” are used for sentries or hunting. Kuei-go 
pit fights are also popular in certain, less savory areas of the 
empire, though they are officially frowned upon.

Kuei do have certain limitations. They are destroyed by 
exposure to sunlight, or by repeated contact with human bodily 

438

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

fluids. Kuei can also be trapped within their own corpse by the 
application  of  jade  to  the  eyes  and  tongue,  imprisoning  the 
hungry ghost within their body. And even if a kuei avoids these 
fates, it only has three years before succumbing to Oblivion. 
Rare cases have been known to endure longer, but they are few 
and far between.

Kuei can be rendered into White Jade, but the material that 
results is of inferior quality, and breaks down after a few months. 
They do have a few basic Passions, all related to family or corpse, 
and some possess mastery of a single level of various Arcanoi.

Eunuchs

Eunuchs are the walking, talking, mindless repositories of 
knowledge of the Empire. Drained of all Willpower and Moli-
ated into a form best suited for functional record keeping, they 
store knowledge of Imperial decrees, local proclamations, and 
whatever else they are told to record by their masters. Many 
are guarded by locks, with the key formed from the Eunuch’s 
own Corpus. 

Each of the branches of the Imperial government has its 
own particular use for, and special type of, Eunuch. Eunuchs 
cannot lie, nor can they alter the information kept within them, 
and for these reasons they are considered utterly trustworthy.
The Immortal Guard

The most powerful force within the Empire’s military, the 
backbone of the emperor’s power, and the most terrifying and 
awe-inspiring of the Emperor’s servants, the Immortal Guards-
men are the elite soldiers that helped build an empire. Created 
by the legendary Fu Xia, they are the spirits of the best of the 
Emperor’s soldiers, bound up in the terra cotta bodies of the 
army buried with Qin Shihuang upon his death. Now, in the 
afterlife, they maintain their stone-hard exterior while being 
able to move with too-perfect smoothness and agility. Further-
more, they glow unnaturally in shades of red, orange, and other 
bright colors that have no place in the Underworld. To see them 
is to see something that by all rights should not be, and the 
discomfort their mere presence inspires is part of their power.
Originally, there were three regiments of Guardsmen, each 
6,000 strong. And while it is almost impossible to destroy a 
member of the Guard, their irreplaceable numbers have been 
whittled down over the years. No one knows how many remain 

or where they are stationed, though the ever-expanding reach 
of the Empire dictates many must be deployed to the colonies. 
And yet, there always seems to be a small squad of Guardsmen 
present when needed. 

The Guardsmen are the only wraiths who know the secrets 
of the Emperor’s Chains. Only members of the Guard can use 
this Arcanos, and to even attempt to teach it (fruitlessly) to 
one outside the Guard means death. Guardsmen spend all their 
time training or in active deployment. They are given the best 
weapons the empire has to offer, and stand in the front line 
against rebels, Spectres, plasmics, or whatever other foes of the 
empire present themselves.

The Guard’s great secret is that its members cannot acquire 
Pathos in the usual manner. Rather, they must be fed souls, 
with each soul supplying the Guardsman with the equivalent 
of several hundred stored Pathos. Only the Emperor can feed 
the  Guard,  and  the  feeding  takes  place  only  in  the  greatest 
secrecy at the Jade Palace at Xi’an.

The Wonders Beyond
Jade

Many of the Artifacts found in the empire are made from 
White Jade. This is a milky white material created from rendered 
wraiths, one which can be crafted into a variety of shapes. The 
garden-variety implements of the Yellow Springs are made of 
White Jade, which is sturdy enough and generally lasts a good 
long while. It can be shaped into weapons, armor, and pretty 
much anything else needed. 

Most White Jade is forged from the unfortunate wraiths 
sentenced to hell; indeed, hell’s real purpose is not the punish-
ment of the wicked, but rather the relentless manufacture of 
White Jade for the Empire’s needs. Wraiths sentenced to hell

are relentlessly abused and worn down until they finally take 
their place on the Wheel of Law, which determines what they 
will be molded into. These wraiths are then fed to a grist mill 
and ground to bits. The resultant material is then smelted into 
an Artifact of White Jade. 

Much rarer is True Jade. Pale green and much sought after, 
True Jade is what results when jade is buried with the body of 
someone who becomes a wraith. Skilled artisans can hammer 
True Jade into almost any form. It is incredibly hard and durable, 
and can hold an edge for centuries; a True Jade blade can slice 
though White Jade like it’s cutting through water (difficulty 
4). True Jade Artifacts are treasured. Many have been adapted 
to  store  Pathos,  and  they  are  rare  and  guarded  jealously  by 
their owners.
Ti Yu

Ti Yu, the Earth Prison, is the capital of what is colloquially 
known as hell. Set up by the Jade Emperor as a means of sourcing 
White Jade, it serves to punish criminals and dissidents. Now 
a thriving city in the Tempest, it can be reached only from the 
mountain Feng Tu. The journey to hell takes seven days, each 
of which features its own unique torments, and at the end, the 
prisoner is then subjected to a trial, found guilty, and turned 
over to all the new agonies the residents and architects of Ti 
Yu can conceive. 
Chinatowns

In major Stygian Necropoli such as London, New York, and 
San Francisco, the skyline and architecture will suddenly shift to 
a series of gabled, inclined roofs with sweeping curvatures that 
rise at the corners. Bored guardsmen lounge at the pillars of giant 
gates that proclaim the entrance to the historical Chinatown. 
Many of the wraiths bustling to and fro will be those of Asian 
descent. While the Chinese wraiths are in the majority, Korean, 
Japanese,  and  other  east-Asian  nationalities  are  represented 
en  masse.  Even  members  of  other  Dark  Kingdoms  might  be 
present, because this is a place of lower commerce, unofficial 
communication, and darker vices.

There are also equivalent Stygian settlements in Yellow 
Springs, often centered on churches. Macau, Singapore, and 
Shanghai’s Bund are all marked by such. There’s even a Midnight 

MRS. MENG

There  is  one  bit  of  respite  on  the  road  to 
hell, an evening at the house of the entity calling 
herself Mrs. Meng. Those wraiths who accept her 
hospitality, behave honorably and politely while 
they are her guests, and who refuse the offer of 
hellnotes she makes to bribe the guards may find 
themselves  on  a  different  path  altogether,  one 
that leads either back to the Yellow Springs or 
to Paradise. Or so the story goes.

DID YOU TRY THE CHINATOWN?

The markets of Chinatown are dense with 
competing stalls all selling the same product or 
stalls selling the most unique items or services. 
Many skilled wraiths with talents in Arcanoi usu-
ally only found in the Jade Kingdom or elsewhere 
might be found here plying their trades. Others 
might be trading in Pathos coins, and still others 
might be slinging various relics new and old. Lost 
and stolen Stygian steel and White Jade objects 
can also find their way to the market. But buyer 
beware; not everything is what it seems.

Imperial troops. 
Arcanoi and the Yellow Springs

By  and  large,  the  Stygian  Arcanoi  are  known  and  used 
throughout  the  Empire.  In  addition,  there  are  a  handful  of 
Arcanoi that are unique to Yu Huang’s domain. Teaching an 
outsider one of these is grounds for being sent to Feng-Tu, and 
one, Chains of the Emperor, literally cannot be taught to anyone 
not of the Immortal Guard.

Svarga, The City of Delights

estern  society  is  focused  on  the  tangible. 
Ghosts  cannot  be  seen,  they  cannot  be 
touched  or  measured,  and  therefore  they 
do not exist. The lines are not so clean in 
southern Asia. Indian wraiths are afforded 
a very different existence than their Stygian 
counterparts, simply because Indian culture 
is, on the whole, far more sanguine about the presence of ghosts 
and malevolent creatures of the night. Spirits are blamed for 
any  number  of  occurrences  in  daily  life.  An  unhappy  spirit 
might break dishes, or a stressed worker might suffer illness via 
ghostly possession. Unlike the west, the veil between the worlds 
is thinner simply because the people of India believe. Every city 
or village hosts at least one wise old man or woman who claims 
to know the mantras, spells, or curses required to interact with 
the dead. These Mantriks call upon the spirits to settle disputes, 
find lost information, help allies, or hinder enemies. 

The View from Without

To the Stygian visitor, Svarga feels deceptively similar. It’s 
easy to equate Bhuvar with the Shadowlands, the Sea of Shiva 
with the Tempest, or Pisachas with Shades, but assuming those 
correspondences tell the whole story can lull a wraith into a false 
sense of security. Even with simple concepts, a slightly different 
outlook can cause affronts and misunderstandings between visi-
tors and native wraiths. For example, western wraiths tend to 
place a higher value on individual independence than residents 
of Bhuvar. Most Indian wraiths believe they have a responsibility 
to tradition and their personal cycle. The distinction between 
“unfinished business” and “karmic debt” can be a confusing one.

Samsara, the Cycle of Rebirth

The  corporeal  being  is  composed  of  three  parts.  The 
Karana Sarira, or “causal body,” is the seed, the “beginningless 
ignorance,” from which the other two parts spring. The Shula 
Sarira, or “gross body,” makes up a being’s physical form, while 
their Sukshma Sarira, or “subtle body,” is the being’s spirit, or 
Corpus. When a person dies, their Javi, or soul, is still tethered 
to the now-useless Shula Sarira. Proper care of the soul requires 
an elaborate ceremony called Antyesti, a process of releasing the 
soul and preparing the Sukshma Sarira. Without the Antyesti 
ritual, even the most virtuous soul can be warped and deformed 
by their imprisonment in the Shula Sarira, and return as a bro-

WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS?

Southern  Asia  is  home  of  any  number  of 
religions, including the faiths that originated in 
the area (Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism) 
as  well  as  Christianity,  Islam,  and  more.  Each 
of these has their own vision of the afterlife. In 
India, the vast majority of believers are Hindu. 
Consequently, the Dark Kingdom that western 
wraiths have found is predominantly Hindu. It 
is  possible  that  Svarga  simply  dominates,  just 
as the majority of the Western underworld falls 
under the structures and psychogeography of the 
Stygian Empire. Other Dark Kingdoms may exist 
in the storm-tossed Sea of Shiva, but no Stygian 
wraith has returned to speak of them.

ken, evil thing. Over the course of 10 or 11 days, the Suskhma 
Sarira is built. Each day develops another part of the subtle 
body, providing a head and neck, heart, spine, navel, genitals, 
thighs, knees, ankles, and feet. 

Similarly, the Javi itself is divided into a number of qualities, 
called Gunas. A soul’s qualities fall into three distinct classes. 
The first is Sattva, which relates to divinity or purity, and most 
directly relates to a western wraith’s Psyche and Eidolon. The 
second class is Tamas, which contains the darker qualities, like 
the Shadow and Angst. Finally, there is Rajas, which represents 
qualities related to activity or change, such as Passions or Pathos. 
Gray Wastes and Brilliant Oases 

The universe is a complex thing, comprised of many levels 
and worlds. The upper worlds are known as Lokas, while the 
lower levels are called Talas. The world of the living, or Bhur, 
is the Loka we are most familiar with, the concrete reality that 
surrounds us. Layered atop that is Bhuvar, the Loka of the ghosts. 
Those souls who, for whatever reason, cannot move on in the 
continuous flow find themselves in Bhuvar. 

Bhuvar is a dark, desaturated place. The overgrown fields 
lay fallow and colorless. The temples and homes are dilapidated, 
crumbling ruins. Everything is gray and decayed. But in the 
distance,  the  city  of  Svarga  bursts  with  color,  a  shimmering 
Oz  locked  away  behind  gleaming  walls.  The  reward  for  all 
the wraiths’ toil and labor lies just within sight. Wraiths learn 
quickly that if they work hard and liberate themselves from their 
Fetters, either through Resolution or (for the desperate many) 
destruction, they may eventually earn the right to move on to 
the next stage, within the fertile garden of delights. 

For  all  intents  and  purposes,  Bhuvar  is  identical  to  the 
Shadowlands. The primary difference is one of outlook, and it 
is a surprisingly important distinction. To those who find them-
selves in Bhuvar, it is a waystation on the road to reincarnation, 
a temporary stop where the wraith must pay their karmic debts. 

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

441

Those souls who do not make their way to Bhuvar are assumed 
to have been judged by Yama and sent on their way to the next 
stage of the cycle. The wraiths of Bhuvar don’t believe they 
are in some kind of punitive hell analog. Rather, they have 
simply been found in need of some sort of karmic cleansing, to 
be determined by Yama’s servitors, the judges. 

In many ways, the judges are similar to Stygian Reapers. 
They free newly dead wraiths from their Cauls and welcome them 
to Bhuvar. It is their task to help the Enfant find her place in 
wraith society. Unlike Stygia, manacles and chains are replaced 
by tradition and faith. This is, if not familiar, then at least a 
feasible part of the newly arrived wraith’s worldview. Ostensibly, 
the judge is to examine them with Fatalism, while the wraith is 
asked to recite the litany of her life. The judge decides how the 
Enfant can best serve the Heavenly Regent and gain entrance 
to the City of Delights. The process is a long and arduous one, 
complicated by an enormously baroque bureaucracy and little 
to no recognition of merit or hard work. On the rare occasion 
that a call for justice does wend its way through the system, it 
does so with all the speed and urgency of a somnolent turtle. 
Of course, judges are as human as the wraiths who depend 
on them, and they are as susceptible to corruption as any other. 
Some merely make a show of judgement and promptly deliver 
the new wraith into the hands of a predetermined master in 
return for favors or other compensation. Either way, the Enfant is 
usually taken to the nearest enclave and put to work in whatever 

role is deemed necessary. While the caste system has loosened 
in modern Indian society, there are many in Bhuvar who still 
hold firm with the old ways. Whatever the Enfant’s status in the 
living world, he may suddenly find himself on the bottom rung 
in the Shadowlands. The highest-ranking caste, the Brahmin, 
are the rulers and inhabitants of the City of Delights, while the 
Kshatriya make up the officers of the Host and the leaders of the 
various settlements of Bhuvar. Minor functionaries and traders 
are considered part of the Vaishyas. The bulk of the population 
of Bhuvar are Sudras, laborers who perform whatever tasks their 
“betters” require of them.

Depending on the situation, the new wraith might find 
herself clearing fields that never seem to be planted or built 
upon, assigned to watch over a ruined temple that might attract 
Naga, or join a trading caravan as servant or guard. She might 
be enlisted into military service as part of the Host of Svarga, 
or slotted into the increasingly complex and bizarre structure 
of minor officials who seem to exist solely to make work for 
other officials. In some rare cases, a wraith is evaluated and the 
judge declares that there must have been some kind of divine 
clerical error. The wraith is shuttled directly to the palace and 
their eternal reward. Those left behind whisper behind closed 
doors that it can’t be that simple, and the wraiths who enter 
the palace are never seen again… but if they moved on, they 
wouldn’t be, would they? 

442

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The Naga

Not all those who toil within sight of the city accept the 
status quo. They whisper to one another, and they resent the 
elite who exist in luxury while their existence is hardly better 
than slavery. Life was enough of a hardship. They refuse to suffer 
through a second life of servitude on the hope that this time, the 
promise of reward will be kept. No, it is better to war on the Holy 
Regent and the City of Delights, just as the serpentine Naga of 
myth war on the gods for their wealth. The wraiths who take 
up the banner of the Naga work to breach the walls of Svarga 
in any way they can. The Naga have occasionally attempted 
to force their way through the gates, to take what they have 
lost hope of earning. Thus far, the beautiful and terrible Host 
of Svarga has repelled every attempt, crushing the rebels and 
dragging them away, never to be seen again.

The Naga coil in one of the lower Talas, a disphotic place 
called Patala. In the darkness there, they built a series of palaces 
and cities, pale reflections of the riches of Svarga. It is even 
said that they recreated small gardens of their own. But those 
miniature paradises provide little comfort; they must be kept up 
through constant raiding and sacrifice, and merely remind the 
Naga of the sheer abundance being kept from them. Recently, 
the Naga turned their attention to the outposts of Bhuvar, where 
they are less likely to encounter the full force of the Host. They 
may not reap the same rewards so far from Svarga, but they are 
far more likely to succeed.
The Asura

The Naga are not the only faction lurking in the lower 
Talas. Like the Naga, the Asura oppose the Host of Svarga, but 
where the Naga envy the luxury of the City of Delights, the 
Asura reject it outright. Though the Asura do not know the 
secret of Svarga, they believe that the abundance of the city is 
maintained at great cost. Some say that the price is a tithe of 
accumulated karma; others that it requires a step back down 
the wheel. There are nearly as many rumors as there are Asura, 
but all of them oppose what they view as spiritual extortion. 
They view accepting whatever cost it requires to become part 
of the City of Delights as, at best, a distraction from the cycle. 
The Asura do everything they can to discover the truth behind 
what they call the Great Lie. They fight to save wraiths from 
whatever  fate  awaits  them  within  Svarga’s  walls,  and  they 
surreptitiously proselytize among the working class of Bhuvar. 

The Walled City of Svarga

The wraiths of Bhuvar dream of the City of Delights. A 
riot of color bursts from within its enormous walls. Inside lies 
the glory of Svarga; countless boulevards bristle with palaces 
and temples, and the avenues are lined with verdant gardens 
and luxurious courtyards. The air is as full of music as the city 
is stuffed with loveliness. Every inhabitant of the city was Moli-
ated into forms of great beauty and awe, often adopting aspects 
of divinity such as blue or red skin or a third eye. The most 

THE SECRET OF SVARGA

The flourishing gardens and sumptuous feasts 
of  Svarga  are  simply  impossible.  While  it  may 
be comforting to pretend otherwise, there is no 
cheating death, even in the so-called City of De-
lights. As with the other lands of the dead, there 
is no life where death holds sway. No plants may 
grow; no crops can be harvested. Within the Dark 
Kingdoms, the only things that exist are wraiths 
and the cast-off detritus of the living world. But 
the Holy Regent believes that it is better to rule 
through  hope  than  fear.  The  city  is  a  shining 
jewel of hope for the masses of Bhuvar, a better 
yoke than shackles could ever be. 

Within the City of Delights, a group of ex-
perts named after the god of artisans, Tvashtriyas, 
specializes in the creation of technicolor dreams. 
They dissolve unfortunate wraiths and literally 
shape the distilled stuff of their souls into plants, 
food, water, and soma. The ritual of dissolution 
and reformation is no small thing, requiring an 
enormous amount of skill and knowledge. A num-
ber of Arcanoi are involved, including Inhabit, 
Moliate, and Usury. The Tvashtriyas are highly 
respected  and  prized  within  Svarga  and  it’s  no 
surprise; without them, the false paradise would 
collapse, and the elite of the city would have to 
acknowledge their own bleak mortality. 

Make  no  mistake,  the  secret  of  Svarga  is 
an  open  one,  at  least  within  the  walls  of  the 
city. Every inhabitant is complicit. The beauty 
is  not  complete;  the  foliage  murmurs  in  tor-
ment.  The  burbling  water  begs  for  release. 
But  it  is  a  subtle  sound,  easily  countered  with 
stirring  songs  and  animated  conversation. 
The  courtiers  and  Gandharvas  entertain  in 
large  part  to  maintain  the  illusion  of  paradise. 
To  satisfy  the  endless  appetite  of  Svarga,  the 
Host must engage in nearly constant campaigns 
against the city’s enemies. The bulk of the souls 
used to sustain the city come from the ranks of 
the Nagas, Asuras, and Spectres like the Pisachas. 
Soldiers who fail to heed their orders — capture 
over annihilation or escape — often become an 
example to their fellows. Someone has to take 
the place of the souls that are lost or “wasted” 
by an overzealous soldier, after all.

talented Gandharvas sing, and dancers called Apsaras perform 
while alluring courtiers mingle with the reveling elite in lush 
garden courtyards. The Holy Regent and his citizens indulge

every sensual urge. Here, unlike the gray lands outside the walls, 
the trees burst with delicious fruit and the clear water is cool 
and refreshing. Soma is the drink of choice among citizens of 
Svarga, a powerful and intoxicating beverage that is one of the 
many resources produced by artisans within the City of Delights.
The Sea of Shiva

The roiling Sea of Shiva surrounds Bhuvar on all sides, 
separating  it  from  the  other  Lokas  and  Talas.  Nightmarish 
creatures of legend slide through the depths of that pounding, 
tumultuous water lying in wait to prey upon foolish travelers. 
Familiar to western wraiths as the Tempest, only the bravest 
or foolhardiest of wraiths make the trek across those waters, 
and only the most suicidal do so alone. The Byways are thick 
with Spectres, known here as Pisachas and Bhuta, who prey 
upon careless wanderers and would-be good samaritans. Canny 
travelers never greet or stop to help other wraiths in the Sea of 
Shiva, regardless of how they appear. Many voyages have ended 
in ambush after a wraith begging for aid turned out to be one 
of the perfidious Bhuta. 

As in Stygia, wraiths use Argos to navigate the sea. However, 
Indian wraiths do not view the Arcanos as a skill, so much as a 
matter of purification. The more refined one’s Sukshma Sarira, 
the more easily one travels the sea. Conversely, a wraith whose 
“subtle body” is uncultivated is thought to have a harder time 
traveling between the Lokas and Talas.

Talas

As there are seven upper worlds, there are seven lower twins, 
or Talas. These lower realms are Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Rasatala, 
Talatala, Mahatala, and Patala. Whether these realms of the 
dead are the Talas or simply analogs named by wraiths trying to 
identify and understand their world is up for debate. Whatever 
the truth, the seven Talas surround Bhuvar and Svarga, resting 
at equidistant points in the Sea of Shiva. 

The Naga stage their assaults from the rocky plains of Patala, 
in strongholds and palaces built from the relic ruins that dot 
the landscape and furnished with spoils pilfered from outposts 
in Bhuvar. The greatest Naga stronghold is Bhogavati, and it 
would be a glorious jewel if its inhabitants weren’t so preoccupied 
with the ways it falls short of Svarga’s splendor. Bhogavati is 
ruled by three chieftains known by custom as Shesha, Vasuki, 
and Takshaka, after the greatest Naga of legend. They raid the 
settlements of Bhuvar and, on occasion, the Asura, to provide 
their followers with all the comforts and riches the Host of Svarga 
denies them. The opulent palace in Bhogavati even has a small 
but verdant garden tended by a renegade Tvashtriya. Of all the 
things the Naga have acquired from the Holy Regent’s lands, 
the Tvashtriya is the only true wound they have struck, and 
the Host zealously suppresses rumors of her defection whenever 
they appear. The garden is an enormous tax on Naga resources, 
but it provides invaluable fuel to stoke the raiders’ fire, so the 
chieftains happily pay the price. Officially, captured soldiers 
of  the  Host  are  the  only  sacrifices  made  to  the  Tvashtriya’s 

ministrations,  but  upstarts  and  rivals  of  the  chieftains  have 
been known to disappear when times grow lean.

Mahatala and Talatala also fall under the auspices of smaller 
Naga factions. True to their bandit natures, the Naga are not a 
monolithic force, and the Naga of these Talas raid one another 
as often as they do Bhuvar. But even these feuds are easily put 
aside for mutual profit when a raid on Svarga forms. 

The Asuras control Sutala and Rasatala. Their communi-
ties are less ostentatious than the Naga’s, owing to their dif-
fering values. This is not to say that all Asura settlements are 
puritanical affairs, but they do tend toward the practical, rather 
than the sumptuous. The Asura separated themselves from the 
citizenry  of  Bhuvar  for  a  multitude  of  reasons,  ranging  from 
the ascetic to the skeptical. If, as so many of them believe, the 
cost to maintain Svarga is so dear, then it would be immoral to 
nurture even a shadow of its splendor themselves. 
The Heavenly Regent of Indra

According to tradition, the Loka of Heaven is ruled by 
Indra,  the  leader  of  the  Devas,  a  golden-skinned,  dancing 
god. Svarga’s Heavenly Regent speaks for Indra, and his word 
is law. The Heavenly Regent is said to be an avatar of Indra, 
one aspect of the god who deigns to guide the wraiths through 
their cycle. He takes the form of an intensely attractive, well-
muscled man with a full beard and sensuous lips; in essence, 
the very image of Indra.

Everyone knows the Heavenly Regent rarely leaves the 
lush utopia of Svarga. He is rarely seen by himself, preferring 
the company of an entourage of unearthly courtiers. On the 
rare  occasion  that  he  does  leave,  his  caravan  is  a  wondrous 
sight, a moving technicolor oasis in the drab countryside. The 
Regent’s presence radiates beauty and life, even if it is only a 
temporary blossoming. In truth, the Regent leaves more often 
than his people realize. Through judicious use of Arcanoi, he 
visits his Citadels in drab disguises — the better to know what 
his lieutenants and acolytes are really up to. An ostentatious 
caravan tends to advertise itself too far in advance for the Regent 
to gauge the real situation in Bhuvar.

In general, the Heavenly Regent chooses the carrot over 
the stick. He believes the wraiths of Bhuvar are more power-
fully motivated by their desire to gain entrance to Svarga than 
they  would  be  by  fear  of  their  overlords.  In  troubled  times, 
the Heavenly Regent mounts offensives against the Nagas or 
the Asuras, making certain that his army is augmented by the 
troublemakers and ne’er-do-wells who don’t toe the line. At 
other times, a search for duplicitous Bhuta can serve as an equally 
effective distraction. With the right finesse, the citizens become 
paranoid, examining one another for indicators of evil — and 
what could be a more telling sign of iniquity than questioning 
the Heavenly Regent’s divine order?
Interaction with the Mortal World

While  cemeteries  sprawl  across  western  countries,  most 
westerners believe their loved ones have passed on, whether 

444

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

to  some  great  reward  or  an  ineffable  beyond.  In  India,  it  is 
commonly accepted that death is simply another state of be-
ing. Hundreds of thousands visit “ghost fairs” in villages like 
Malajpur for exorcism or invocation. If a person acts oddly or 
falls ill, the malady can be attributed to ghostly interference. 
Enterprising wraiths with appropriate Passions can harvest a 
cornucopia of Pathos just by drifting through the ecstatic crowds 
that flood the ghost fairs for weeks at a time.

Exorcism is easily the primary duty of India’s hedge sorcer-
ers. Different traditions employ varying methods and rituals to 
enact the exorcism, from fasting and ritual chants, to coercion 
and bribery, to literally beating the ghost out of its host with a 
broom. Ultimately, the ritual is merely a focus for the exorcist’s 
faith.  Exorcising  a  wraith  using  Puppetry  or  Inhabit  (in  the 
case of objects) requires a resisted roll between the True Faith 
[rated 1 to 10] of the exorcist and the Willpower of the wraith. 
If the wraith botches, he must leave that body or object, never 
to possess it again. Should the exorcist botch, he may never 
again attempt to force the wraith to leave that particular form.
According to local lore, a ghost may only possess a person 
with a similar Guna to their own. The truth is that a wraith 
may possess anyone, given the appropriate Arcanoi, but it is far 
easier if the target’s current emotional state matches one of the 
wraiths’ Passions. By the same token, it is more difficult for a 
wraith to possess a target whose emotions are drastically differ-
ent from her Passions. The bonus (or penalty) is determined by 
the intensity of the target’s emotional state, at the Storyteller’s 
discretion. The modifier also applies to attempts to exorcise the 
wraith — it’s much harder to evict an aggressive wraith from a 
livid host than from a peaceful one.

Sorcerers also petition ghosts on behalf of their clients, 
summoning  them  to  engage  their  services  through  force  or 
bribery. The easiest method to get a wraith’s attention is ac-
quiring one of her Fetters, but it’s certainly not the only path a 
sorcerer might take. For less discriminating needs, a noisy ritual 
wherein the sorcerer destroys food or other objects will draw 
wraiths like moths to a flame, allowing the sorcerer to make his 
bargain while the ghosts gather the resulting relics in Bhuvar. 

Spectres
Pisachas

Brahma’s son Krodha was the embodiment of rage, and 
Krodha’s wife Himsa was the avatar of violence. Together they 
begat Kali, the archenemy of Vishnu. It is also said that Himsa 
gave birth to deformed, flesh-eating demons called Pisachas. 
The shadowlands of Bhuvar are beset by malevolent Shades with 
more than a little resemblance to the vicious children of Krodha 
and Himsa. These Pisachas make solitary travel through the 
Sea of Shiva all but impossible, and even endanger wanderers 
in the relative safety of Bhuvar. They set upon wraiths with no 
regard to allegiance or mercy. Their ravening brutality is one of 
the only things that can inspire the Asuras, Nagas, and the Host 
of Svarga to put aside their differences, even for a short time.

Bhuta

If the Pisachas are deadly, implacable foes, at least their 
gruesome appearance gives their enemies some warning. The 
Bhuta are Dopplelgangers, moving unnoticed among the masses, 
causing as much suffering as possible. Commonly considered to 
be wraiths who suffered violent deaths but did not receive funeral 
rites, the Bhuta are malevolent due to spiritual circumstance 
rather than an inherently evil nature. It is unknown if that is 
the true origin of the creatures, or if Bhuta are created in some 
other way entirely. Whatever the case, they are cunning and 
subtle creatures who spurn the blunt, bludgeoning violence of 
the Pisachas in favor of insidious corruption. A Bhuta might 
choose to ingratiate himself with a Citadel’s taskmaster, subtly 
introducing miscommunication and mistrust within the chain 
of command or changing work orders to cause dangerous short-
ages. Another might act as the herald of an imminent Naga 
strike, quietly riling the workers into attacking their masters, 
only  to  slip  away  before  the  erstwhile  rebels  realize  that  no 
reinforcements are coming. 

It’s the easiest thing in the world to blame a Bhuta when 
something  goes  wrong,  so  they  have  become  a  convenient 
scapegoat  across  Bhuvar.  Within  Svarga’s  area  of  influence, 
wraiths live under the “if you see something, say something” 
rule, and more than one innocent wraith has been accused of 
being a Bhuta by a jealous rival. The fate of such a wraith is 
rarely pleasant. The process of interrogation is difficult, to say 
the least, and it is not unheard of for a wraith to succumb to 
Oblivion at the judges’ hands. Even if a wraith survives inter-
rogation  and  is  exonerated,  the  suspicion  can  poison  their 
relationships and bedevil them for the rest of their existence. 
On the other hand, should proof of a false accusation come 
to light, the judges have even less mercy for the accuser who 
abused their sacred authority just to oust an enemy.

The Dark Kingdom of Obsidian

tygian  scholars  interested  in  the  ancient 
history of the Shadowlands will sometimes 
discuss  the  lost  Dark  Kingdom  of  the 
American continents. Most often, they will 
call it the Dark Kingdom of Obsidian. Rarely, 
they  deign  to  recognize  that  there  were, 
in fact, at least three loosely confederated 
empires of the dead. When they bother to differentiate, they call 
the three lands the Islands of Flint in the Kingdom of Obsidian, 
and the Lands of Gold. But of course, they say, those Kingdoms 
are long gone. At best, one might find a desolate place bereft 
of all but the most faded memories of what once was. At worst, 
the foolhardy will come across a hive of maddened Spectres, 
shattered and incredibly dangerous. 

Just  as  in  the  living  world,  thriving  empires  existed  in 
the Americas long before the first Stygian wraith set foot on 
the continent. When the Europeans found their way to the 
New World, so too did Stygia. Entire cultures were unraveled 
through war, pestilence, assimilation, and conversion. As the 
Native Americans across both continents ceded ground to the 
invaders and colonists, Stygia claimed more and more of the 
Shadowlands, and eventually the Obsidian kingdoms were lost 
in the violent flux of the Third Great Maelstrom. 

While  the  living  may  forget,  the  dead  rarely  have  that 
luxury. Oblivion may take individual souls, but in a land where 
long-burned libraries full of knowledge still echo, nothing stays 
buried  forever.  An  uncomfortable  truth  is  that  the  empires 
and kingdoms of the Underworld are all too often subject to 

Everything turns upon the wheel of creation. The cycle 
of birth, death, and rebirth rolls ever onward. According to 
the  Legend  of  Five  Suns,  the  world  has  been  wrought  and 
torn asunder four times, the people created and destroyed by 
the gods again and again. In the beginning, Ometeotl was all 
of creation. It unfolded itself into gods who in turn unfolded 
themselves and so on. Every person, plant, animal, and object 
is a fragment of creation. Everything that has been or will be 
came from — and will return to — Ometeotl. When someone 
dies, their energy is reabsorbed into creation and used to create 
some other part of the universe. 

At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work.
The last age ended in a great flood. The sun was struck down 
and the sky was ruptured, unleashing a torrent of water that 
covered the earth. In the darkness, the great feathered serpent 
Quetzalcoatl descended into the earth and brought forth two 
skeletons made of obsidian. He breathed life into the skeletons 
and made a man and a woman. The man’s name was Mixcoatl, 
and he became renowned as a proud and powerful warrior. He 
guided and cared for his people until he died of old age. Rather 
than be folded back into Ometeotl and reborn as he expected, 
Mixcoatl found himself on the outskirts of the capital of his 
empire. He wandered the city in a daze, searching for someone 
who could help him. He grabbed at his subjects, shouted in their 
faces, but nobody could see or hear him. Mixcoatl felt drawn 
to the feast hall, where he found his family and friends feasting 
and exchanging gifts. At the head of the table lay Mixcoatl. He 
looked on his own face, and he fled into the wilderness in terror.
He should have been taken in by Ometeotl, reformed into 
something else. Why had the gods forsaken him? He was in 
the world he had always known without being a part of it. The 
gods must have done this for a reason! Mixcoatl was created 
by Quetzalcoatl to repopulate the earth and to care for it. His 
calling was to bind the people together so that they might better 
serve the gods. He refused to believe that they would simply 
abandon him. So, he reasoned, the gods must have put him here 
to continue caring for his people in a new way. Though there is 
honor in sacrifice by death, death was not the greatest sacrifice 
one might make to please the gods. Remaining separate from 
Ometeotl, trusting in the gods and doing his best to serve them 
even in this dark place, that was the sacrifice the gods required. 
With new resolve, Mixcoatl learned how to affect the living 
world. From beyond the grave, he helped to guide his people and 
provide for them. He summoned nourishing rains when the Olmec 
farmers were struggling; he frightened the enemies of his people 
when they dared to come too near. In time, he found others like

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

WHAT ABOUT THE ISLANDS OF FLINT AND THE LANDS OF GOLD?

The Dark Kingdom of Flint was never a single entity, at least not in the sense that Stygian histories 
describe. Rather, the kingdom was itself a loose confederation of five large power blocs of Native American 
wraiths: The Iroquois Nation, the Council of Tribes, the Cherokee Nation, the People of Peace, and the Inuit. 
Even among those power blocs there lay fragments, small shifting alliances made up of over 500 individual 
tribes, with a dizzying array of social systems and beliefs. 

According to Stygian history, the Islands of Flint are officially destroyed. Nothing is left of the First Nations 
in the Shadowlands except Spectre-haunted burial mounds and battlegrounds, and long, jagged, wood and iron 
scars haunted by shadow locomotives. Legion patrols tend to avoid those places, or they are never seen again. It 
is rare that Stygian citizens find their way into the Islands of Flint, and even rarer that they find their way out.

The Lands of Gold bore the brunt of the horrors that led to the Third Great Maelstrom. As European explorers 
sought El Dorado, Stygian Renegades and Heretics also sought to escape the inquisitors. By Skinriding sailors leav-
ing Iberian ports, they descended upon the Lands of Gold as hate and fear grew within them. When their Shadows 
seized control, they unleashed decades of war and atrocity. The deathly triple alliance of Obsidian, Gold, and Flint 
fought together against the invaders throughout all three empires, but it was in the Lands of Gold that Ix Chel, 
known to the Deathlords of Stygia as the Obsidian Queen, was destroyed by the Heretics and Renegades. The Lands 
of Gold themselves were hurled into Oblivion, churning the Sea of Shadows into a Tempest that has never ended.

Whether the Lands of Gold have truly been destroyed, are lost on the other side of some unexplored 
Byway, or have intentionally closed their gates to visitors and hidden themselves away is unknown. Rumors 
pop up of artifacts and treasures waiting for adventurous wraiths within the golden ruins, but thus far, nobody 
in Stygia has produced proof one way or the other.

him, and he taught them the same tricks he had learned. The 
Olmec Empire blossomed under Mixcoatl’s guidance. 
The Four Houses of the Flayed Lands

When Mixcoatl was building his shadow empire, the Ol-
mecatl began to attribute the haunting effects of his assistance 
to an elusive spirit-god they called the Werejaguar. Their artists 
created icons and tributes to the Werejaguar, and Mixcoatl was 
pleased. He took on the mantle of the Werejaguar and his follow-
ers organized under the banner of the House of the Werejaguar. 
The sacrifices of the Olmec people worshipping the Werejaguar 
served to make Mixcoatl ever more powerful, and he found his 
way into the dreams of several Olmec seers to demand more 
sacrifices. The ranks of the House of the Werejaguar grew, and 
with them grew the Olmecian Empire. 

But the Olmecatl began to rely too heavily on the interference of 
the Werejaguar. They became debased and spoiled under Mixcoatl’s 
care. Rather than hunt, they were too willing to wait for game to 
be led to them. When a small tribe from the south had the gall to 
stand up to the swelling tide of Olmecian influence, they went to 
war. The House of the Werejaguar did what they could, but the 
Olmec warriors had grown soft, and could not fight for themselves. 
The Empire crumbled under the weight of its own decadence.

When the Olmecian Empire collapsed, Mixcoatl went with 
it. At first, the higher-ranking members of the House of the 
Werejaguar concealed his disappearance, but it soon became 

THE BALL GAME

The most popular sport in Mesoamerica is a 
precursor to basketball known simply as “the ball 
game.” It was played by every major civilization 
from  the  Olmecs  to  the  Aztecs.  In  the  Flayed 
Lands, it was possibly even more popular, since 
it helped the various tribes and houses to find 
common  ground,  as  well  as  an  outlet  for  their 
competitive spirit. 

In  the  Skinlands,  the  mortals  used  the  ball 
game as a crucible of sorts, training their warriors 
to work together and attain the peak of physical 
prowess, and sacrificing the losers to maintain the 
power of the ghostly kingdom supporting them. In 
the Flayed Lands, the ball game still holds a spiritual 
and martial significance. The teams symbolize the 
struggle between Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca, 
and the constant fight for balance. The teams are 
groomed by each house, and their victories are a 
source of pride for all the members of that house. 

Even now, as modern spirits trickle into the 
Dark Kingdom of Obsidian, with their basketball 
and football, the ball game remains at the center 
of Flayed Lands society.

apparent that the House had lost its stranglehold on the Flayed 
Lands. Until now, only those who had been Olmecatl in life 
found their way into the afterlife. With the fall of the Olme-
cian Empire, the worship of the Werejaguar became déclassé, 
and the faith that flowed from the Skinlands dried up. Wraiths 
from other tribes began to appear, with the names of other gods 
on their lips. Werejaguar no longer held the sole position of 
power in the Skinlands, and as the followers of Xipe Totec, Ix 
Chel, and Itzamna died, their faith spread into the underworld.
Here, as in the living world, they denied the power of the 
Olmecs, and built their own houses named after the gods of their 
people. Each tribe gathered their own and groomed their living 
descendants for greatness, just as the Werejaguar had. They ig-
nited wars that were fought on both sides of life and death. The 
living tribes were kept from reaching their potential, lashed to 
the foolish ambitions of leaders long dead through their priests 
and seers. The houses waged brutal wars among themselves, and 
many souls were obliterated in the conflict. The members of the 
House of the Werejaguar had experienced this folly for them-
selves, and they saw that this war was everything Mixcoatl had 
railed against. So, they brought the dead together for a summit.
The summit very nearly failed before it began. The new 
houses were suspicious of the Werejaguar’s motives, and wary 
of their enemies in the other houses. It had been some time 
since the House of the Werejaguar held any real power in the 
Skinlands, but they were still a force to be reckoned with in the 
Flayed Lands. Through sheer willpower and faith in Mixcoatl’s 
message of unity, the Werejaguar held the summit together. 

Eventually, the houses came to an agreement. The wraiths 
of the Flayed Lands would no longer concentrate all their influ-
ence on a single tribe. Instead, they would come together to 
improve the lot of all of Mesoamerica. Rather than join one of 
four houses based on which tribe one came from, they would be 
divided according to the way they had lived their lives. Each 
house would be made up of polar opposites, to maintain the 
balance of duality that fills every part of creation. Each house 
would be dedicated to one of the gods, and its leader would 
take  on  that  god’s  name  as  well.  The  houses  would  take  in 
wraiths who represented the values of their patron deity. The 
four leaders would govern as partners, each with an equal voice 
in the new Council of the Flayed Lands.

Despite this decision or, perhaps, because of it, tensions ran 
high in the days after the formation of the council. Mesoamerica 
was a land of many different gods, and the Flayed Lands were 
now home to as many different bands of wraiths who championed 
those gods. Those who weren’t included in the final four houses 
resented those who were, and they chafed under the new system. 
The council itself had no leader; the idea of a society of equals 
left  nobody  to  moderate  the  four  houses  as  they  maneuvered 
among themselves to gain the most power for their constituents. 
Even now, after the Conquest, there is no voice that unites the 
interests of the Council. The four houses squabble over scraps, 
each trying to attain dominance over the others in a land still 
scarred by the coming of Stygia and the Maelstrom that followed.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The Fifth Sun

As the Mesoamerican tribes spread, the Flayed Lands grew 
with them. The houses, working in concert, helped the mortals 
build a complex and vital society. The wraiths of the Flayed 
Lands discovered the different layers of their world, from the 
Shadowlands to the Tempest. Their attention no longer divided 
by internecine war, they began to carve a unified kingdom out 
of the tumultuous and stormy seas. 

They named this new kingdom the Fifth Sun, in honor 
of the age in which the Flayed Lands were established. There, 
the four houses built up an enormous metropolis, with mas-
sive temples to their patron gods, elaborate palaces, and even 
sports stadiums. 

The Fifth Sun was prosperous. Their symbiotic relation-
ship with the mortal priests provided a constant flow of Pathos, 
which they forged into one of the greatest empires of the dead 
the world has ever seen. 

Then the ships arrived.

The Conquest

When the first Spanish ships arrived in the New World, 
they  brought  passengers.  Heretics,  fleeing  the  political  and 
religious  persecution  of  Stygia,  stowed  away  among  the  liv-

ing explorers and missionaries, and sought freedom from the 
oppressive regime of Charon and his Deathlords. When they 
arrived in the Flayed Lands, they were tired and desperate, and 
they did not expect the elaborate kingdom that awaited them. 
Unwilling to return to the hell from whence they came, and 
unable to understand the civilization they had stumbled onto, 
the Heretics chose war.

The xenophobic Stygian wraiths quickly learned that the 
sacrifices  that  human  priests  made  to  their  gods  fueled  the 
power of the Flayed wraiths, so the Heretics possessed bands 
of Spanish warriors and generals, and manipulated their living 
counterparts into war against the tribes. 

When the Heretics first arrived, the Obsidian Council weren’t 
quite sure what to make of them. The House of the Werejaguar 
called for assimilation and unification, as they believed Mixcoatl 
would have wanted. Ix Chel and Xipe Totec both argued that 
the Stygian wraiths brought nothing but trouble, and demanded 
that the Flayed Lands prepare for war. Unfortunately, the council 
was still locked in deliberation when the Heretics struck. The 
council was too divided to mount a cohesive defense against foes 
attacking on both sides of the Shroud. They failed to stop the 
Heretics early, when a decisive victory was still possible. The war 
drew out, and as the Spanish forces overwhelmed the aboriginal 
population, the flow of Pathos stopped. 

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

449

The Flayed Lands crumbled, and the once-powerful Obsid-
ian wraiths ceded more and more of the Shadowlands to the 
Heretical Stygian wraiths. The battle spread to the Lands of 
Gold and the Islands of Flint, and still the houses argued among 
themselves. Most, faced with the loss of their power, favored 
retreat. Some Flayed wraiths had the foresight to understand 
what was happening when the Spanish forces overthrew the 
first  priests.  They  dug  down  into  the  Tempest  and  began  to 
build a new realm, a New Sun to replace the one they could 
see setting behind them. They called the new realm Mictlan. 
The leader of the House of Ix Chel refused to retreat. She 
argued that the Heretics had overextended, that the help of 
their allies from the Lands of Gold would easily repel the invad-
ers. She managed to gather her house and the House of Xipe 
Totec behind her. Many of the wraiths who had so recently 
argued for retreat found themselves preparing for a new push 
in the long war, driven by Ix Chel’s confidence and the power 
of her rhetoric. But Ix Chel and the others didn’t understand 
how the tide was turning.

Before the Heretics came, the wraiths of the Flayed Lands 
only knew one way to harvest Pathos; the sacrifices made by the 
human priests. As those priests were slaughtered, the conduit of 
power was irreversibly cut. The Flayed wraiths exhausted their 
power and found themselves unable to use their Arcanoi. Ix 
Chel refused to give in. She fought to the last with her most 

loyal  followers  upon  the  battlefields  of  the  Lands  of  Gold. 
When the Heretics finally brought her low, something deep 
within the Underworld recoiled in horror. The ground buckled 
and cataclysm wracked the Lands of Gold. The Heretics sav-
aged the Flayed Lands and brought an entire civilization low. 
The abomination they committed unleashed the Third Great 
Maelstrom, tore apart the Lands of Gold, the Fifth Sun, and 
even wrought destruction upon Stygia itself.

Only those few Flayed wraiths who had retreated to Mictlan 
survived the desolation that followed. By using the last reserves 
of their Pathos, the refugees were able to conceal the New Sun 
from  the  Heretics.  Their  empire  was  shattered,  the  leaders 
of their houses were dead, and their living descendants were 
assimilated and barred from the old ways. They were trapped 
underground  with  no  outposts  in  the  Shadowlands  and  no 
purpose. But they had survived.
Mictlan Today

Hidden in the Tempest, it took the council centuries to decide 
that the time had come to reopen the Byways of Mictlan and 
venture forth again. The first scouts discovered that the Heretics 
had been banished from the Fifth Sun, but that the Hierarchy 
stood in their place. Where the houses had existed to support 
the living, the Hierarchy only fed off their passions. Without the 
balance of sacrifice and support, the Flayed wraiths were forced 

450

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

to adopt the Stygian method of gathering Pathos. In the past, 
the sacrifices had been willing, the power given freely and with 
honor. Now, the Flayed wraiths felt like thieves. Someday, things 
might return to the old way, but until then, there seemed to be 
no other way to restore things to their rightful place.

The council reestablished a few outposts in the Shadow-
lands, and began to recruit souls into the houses once more. For 
now, they have to be taken surreptitiously, a few at a time. But 
as they are whisked out from under Stygia’s nose, the Flayed 
Lands become more powerful, an inch at a time. The houses 
become more confident, and bands of Flayed warriors hunt the 
Shadowlands of Mexico, striking back where they can at the 
complacent wraiths who stole their world so many years ago. 
Mictlan itself is still small, a network of caverns buried 
beneath  the  ruins  of  the  Fifth  Sun  and  occupied  mainly  by 
ghosts who died almost 500 years ago. Newly Reaped wraiths 
are even more lost than usual when they find themselves in the 
rocky vaults of Mictlan. This is a time capsule, the afterlife of a 
civilization that exists mostly as words in books, or tourist attrac-
tions. While there are active Nahuas extant in Mesoamerica, 
the vast majority of the spirits recruited by the Flayed wraiths 
are Catholic. These are lawyers and shop owners, street kids 
and teachers, and they have no investment in fires that stopped 
burning hundreds of years ago. They’re still trying to cope with 
the idea of their own deaths, trying to figure out where they are 
and how things work. The Werejaguars have seen this before. 
They  know  what  happens  when  new  wraiths  and  their  new 
gods wend their way into the Flayed Lands. It’s only a matter 
of  time  before  the  status  quo  shifts  again,  and  this  time  the 
Werejaguars are determined to see Mixcoatl’s dream through.

Who’s in Charge 

The Dark Kingdom of Obsidian is ruled by the Obsidian 
Council, which is made up of leaders from each of the four houses. 
Ostensibly, there is no head of the council. Theoretically, the group 
is supposed to exist as a parliament of equals, but in reality it is 
constantly shifting, as each house attempts to shift policy to favor 
themselves. In the past, the House of the Werejaguar attempted 
to play moderator, but their tactics have shifted recently, and the 
leaders of the other houses aren’t quite sure why.
The House of the Werejaguar

Once the only house, the Werejaguar is now one of four. 
It has been millennia since Mixcoatl disappeared, leaving the 
house rudderless. Shattered by the loss of their leader and their 
empire, the Werejaguars suffered through centuries of lethargy. 
Recently, a fiery cult of personality has grown up around a new 
leader. Driven by Lord Eight Deer, the freshly minted leader of 
the house, the Werejaguars seem refreshed, ready to reaffirm their 
commitment to Mixcoatl’s vision of unification and expansion. 
They  stopped  accepting  members  when  the  Olmecian 
empire fell, but they have recently begun to take in new recruits 
under Eight Deer. For the moment, the House is still small, how-
ever, the bulk of its members are ancient and powerful wraiths 

who have existed for thousands of years. It is uncertain exactly 
how the newly active Werejaguar Reapers recruit souls to their 
cause, but Eight Deer seems to have less trouble communicating 
with the new wraiths than his peers. The other houses whisper 
that the Werejaguars plan to take over the council. One thing 
is for certain though, their sudden reinvigoration is sure to shift 
the landscape of the Flayed Lands. 
The House of Ix Chel

Ix  Chel  is  the  War  Woman,  the  Jaguar’s  Midwife.  She 
is the red goddess of earth and the bringer of the floods. The 
members of this house achieved great success or suffered great 
failure before their death. Therefore, the house is populated 
with  leaders  and  losers,  kings  and  businessmen  and  beggars. 
When the Heretics arrived, Ix Chel counseled defiance, and 
it was Ix Chel’s wraiths who fought to the bitter end, even as 
other houses stole away to the New Sun. The house is only now 
beginning to recover from the devastating losses it suffered.
The House of Xipe Totec

This is the House of the Flayed God, the god of crops and 
war. Those who were takers or givers of life join the House of 
Xipe Totec. On one hand, the house welcomes farmers, war-
riors, and nurses, but the house also holds murderers and rogues 
of all stripes. Xipe Totec is a house divided. Its members come 
from such incompatible paths, it is inevitable that they find 
themselves constantly at odds with one another. If they could 
unite, the house could be unstoppable within the council, but 
it’s so difficult for the house to find common ground on any 
issue that it remains paralyzed instead.
The House of Itzamna

Itzamna is a creator god, the invisible and mystical ruler of 
the heavens. He is Ix Chel’s counterpart, the sun to her moon, 
and father of her 13 children. It is said that Itzamna was the first 
shaman, that he brought writing, knowledge, and medicine to 
the Maya. Itzamna is an enormous bird whose wings fill the sky. 
He is a symbol for the entire universe, and any wraiths who fit 
into no other houses are more than welcome here. Itzamna is 
by far the largest house, but its members are considered aimless 
wanderers and misfits, and there is very little in the way of a 
powerful leader drawing the Itzamna together. Legends have 
long foretold the rise of Itzamna, but for the moment, the house 
has very little influence in the council.

Duality and the Obsidian Wraith

Wraiths of the Flayed Lands believe in the oneness of all 
things. They value purpose and duty, and believe that when their 
purpose is complete, they will be folded back into Ometeotl, 
to become one with the universe again. This, to them, is Tran-
scendence. If they fail at their purpose, if they fall to Oblivion, 
it is much more than the loss of an individual. It is the loss of a 
piece of the universe itself. It is blasphemy, an affront against 
Ometeotl itself.

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

451

When Ometeotl unfolded itself into all the things that make 
up the universe, it first unfurled into two aspects of itself, two 
pure urges of creation and destruction. The aspect of creation 
was Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent who created Mixcoatl 
and  his  mate.  Destruction’s  darker  urges  were  personified  in 
Tezcatlipoca, the “invisible god,” who helped to form the earth. 
These two aspects are not forces in conflict, however. They are 
opposite urges that work in conjunction toward the goal of a 
perfect world. As spring and summer must give way to autumn 
and winter, so too do Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca take turns 
in ascendance. In this way, they build and destroy each world in 
turn, improving upon the last and working toward perfection.
Or  they  did,  until  the  Third  Great  Maelstrom  tore  the 

balance from its axis. 

The aspect of creation has been known by many names. He 
was Kukulcan, or Q’uq’umatz, or Quetzalcoatl, the Morning Star 
who guided the sun into the sky, the lightbringer and lifesaver. 
He was Ehecatl, the Lord of Wind, who brought the rains and 
fed the crops. He was the protector of all things that grow, and 
in each one, Quetzalcoatl unfolded a piece of himself. The act 
of creating art was, by its nature, a magical rite dedicated to 
the feathered serpent, for it was unfolding a portion of his spirit 
and causing it to manifest.

Destruction  is  not  a  mindless  force.  Entropy  exists  in  a 
necessary  balance  in  Mesoamerican  culture.  Tezcatlipoca  is 
the Evening Star who chases the sun from the sky. He is the 
trickster  spirit  who  baited  the  great  Earth  Monster  with  his 
own foot, and forced her to remain on top of the sea so that the 
people would have something to walk upon. His name means 
“Smoking Mirror,” symbolizing the obsidian that replaced his 
lost leg, and the way in which he communicates with his priests. 
The Center Cannot Hold

When Cortés and his fleet landed in Mexico, Tezcatlipoca 
was ascendant. As was his nature, the Smoking Mirror encour-
aged the destruction of his people, pushing toward the end of the 
Fifth Age. When the Heretics committed the abomination that 
destroyed the Fifth Sun and caused the Third Great Maelstrom, 
something shifted in the great balance. Tezcatlipoca took the 
opportunity to avoid his predestined fate, and dove into the 
vast storm. He was torn by the Maelstrom, wounded, infected, 
and corrupted; the Smoking Mirror became a force of Oblivion. 
Every  wraith  in  the  Flayed  Lands  is  a  dual  spirit,  made 
up of both Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca. Before Ix Chel was 
cast into the Tempest, the Shadow was merely a part of the 
balance, influencing a wraith but never actively driving her 
toward Oblivion. Now, the Flayed wraith’s Shadow is literally 
an unfolding of all the hate and pain that erupted from the 
conquest, intent on destruction and Oblivion. The distinction 
is a subtle one, and mostly manifests in more aggressive tactics, 
but in instances where the Shadow is influencing the wraith 
on matters that echo the conquest — incidents of oppression 
or incursion, for example — any Eidolon rolls may have their 
difficulty increased by 1.

The Bush of Ghosts

verything Stygia knows about Africa is a lie.
To Stygian ambassadors and traders, the 
dead of Africa are gathered under the aegis of 
the so-called Dark Kingdom of Ivory, ruled 
over by a benevolent queen. This kingdom 
unites the dead of the continent and presents 
a single face to the outside world.

And it is a sham.
There is no Dark Kingdom of Ivory, only a front put together 
by several of the rulers of the true kingdoms of Africa’s dead to 
distract and distance outsiders. The queen is a figurehead who 
wields no real power, and the “Dark Kingdom” is the only part 
of the Bush of Ghosts that foreigners are allowed to set foot on.

Beyond the façade, however, rests the truth.

The Bush, Ocean and the Kingdoms

The cities of the African Shadowlands are akin to most cities 
throughout the Underworld: decaying, dangerous, and built of wave 
upon wave of history. Beyond them, however, things change. Away 
from the cities is the Bush, and here can be found the ghosts of trees 
and animals long gone from the Skinlands. Here, too, the Shroud 
is thin, and occasional bursts of sunlight peek through to illuminate 
the great ghostly herds and forests. Nevertheless, the Bush does 
have its dangers, and few abambo are willing to traverse it alone. 
Surrounding  the  Shadowlands  is  the  constantly  roiling 
Ocean. Within the Ocean’s depths, time appears to act differ-
ently; wraiths who swear they were lost for hours emerge from 
the storm years or even centuries later. And of course, there are 
the endless storms that rumble through its depths. 

It is said that all of reality was created from the chaos of 
the Ocean. Whether this is true or not is unknown, but what 
is known is that Byways through the Ocean are few and hard 
to find (except for those well-maintained ones leading to the 
façade of the Dark Kingdom of Ivory). It is also said that the 
Creator tricked the Ocean into giving humans souls, and that 
ever since, the Ocean has sought to reclaim what was its own. 
Deep within the Ocean are the so-called Lost Kingdoms, 
potent  empires  of  the  dead  largely  ruled  by  powerful  beings 
who have taken the title Orisha. Dependent on the reverence 
of the living for their power, the Orisha face an uncertain future 
as Christianity and Islam sweep across the continent, old ways 
are lost or forgotten, and younger wraiths with decidedly more 
materialist viewpoints seek to remake the afterlife. Several of 
the Lost Kingdoms have been taken over by abambo, and one 
is rumored to be under the control of animal ghosts. 

The Four-Part Soul

A wraith from the Bush of Ghosts is known as an ibambo. 
Rather than just a Psyche and Shadow, abambo have four-part 

452

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

souls. There is the Soul, which roughly corresponds to the Psyche, 
and the Shadowself, which equates more or less to the Shadow. 
Beyond that are the Dreamself and the Heartlife. The latter is 
the  ibambo’s  connection  to  the  lands  of  the  living,  while  the 
former is the aspect of the wraith that can harvest and use Pathos. 
Because of the unique nature of their souls, abambo have 
access to a unique Arcanos called Behest. While outsiders have 
seen it in action, it cannot be taught to outsiders. For more on 
Behest, see p. 465.
Animal Abambo

One of the foundational elements of the Bush of the Ghosts 
is that life and death are one, that the living and the dead are 
connected, and that one without the other is incomplete. What 
then to make of the plight of the animal abambo, whose numbers 
in the lands of the living are decreasing catastrophically even as 
they swell in the afterlife? Justifiably, the animal spirits — who 
have their own villages, councils, and laws — are angered by 
this, and there have been incidents where the ghosts of rhinos, 
elephants, and others have exacted revenge on humans they felt 
were deserving, or who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Sikinda

Sikinda are monstrous, cunning creatures intent on way-
laying and destroying as many souls as they can. Possessed of 
devious intelligence, they set ambushes along Byways in the 
Ocean and venture into more populated areas stalking their prey. 
Grotesque of visage, they are roughly equivalent to Shades, but 
far more intelligent and dangerous.
Mla Watu

The Mla Watu, the ghost eaters, believe that by devour-
ing the Corpus of talented wraiths, they can absorb the best 
qualities of their victims. At least one Lost Kingdom is under 
Mla Watu sway, and though their numbers may be few, fear of 
them and their spies is widespread.

Shadowlands

he Shadowlands and the deeper Underworld 
of Australia are distinct and separate. The 
Shadowlands, for all intents and purposes, 
are  part  of  Stygia.  They  consist  of  dim, 
dingy Necropoli huddled along the coast, 
all  of  which  hearken  back  at  least  150 
years in construction and style. Each of the 
Legions is represented here by a full complement of Anacreons 
and  Legionnaires,  but  the  streets  also  teem  with  avowed 
Guildwraiths,  Renegades,  and  even  Heretics.  Stygia  seems 
very far away, and the law is perhaps more accommodating to 
would-be rebels and outsiders.

The  land  outside  the  cities  is  cracked,  dry,  and  dusty. 
Maelstroms here are swirling clouds of choking red dust, not 
the roiling clouds common elsewhere. Between Necropoli, the 
Shadowlands are barren and by and large deserted.

The Tempest surrounding Australia, however, is another 
thing  altogether.  A  roiling  black  ring  of  endlessly  storming 
clouds, it is fearsomely dangerous. Byways through are rare and 
fragile, and wraiths traveling them are always at risk. 

It is said that the cloud is a manifestation of the guilt and 
shame felt by Stygian wraiths for the crimes they and their an-
cestors committed against Australia’s aboriginal people. What 
is known is that the Shadows of Australian wraiths are linked 
via a loose hive mind akin to the one manifested by Spectres, 
and that this vast shadowy intelligence works to force wraiths to 
succumb to despair and guilt over what was done. Supposedly, 
each time a wraith plummets to Oblivion for this reason the 
storm around Australia’s Shadowlands lessens, though many 
dismiss this as wishful thinking.

The Island

The  ancient  island  of  Karta  rises  up  from  the  Tempest, 
its sheer sides made of red rock. 50,000 years old or more, it 
dates back to the Sundering, when life and death first became 
separated. Its surface is a heat-blasted plain of scorched earth 
and caves. Here, originally, only the ghosts of infants and elders 

454

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

came after death. Now, however, Aborigines of all ages find 
themselves  in  Karta  after  death,  there  to  work  on  resolving 
their connections to the living world and preparing themselves 
to enter the Dreamtime. 

The  first  arrivals  in  Karta  were  a  pair  of  brothers  who 
reached  there  from  the  Dreamtime,  Kungaru  and  Kurulba. 
Finding  themselves  trapped,  they  reacted  in  different  ways. 
Kungaru, the elder, set about learning what he could of death 
and what lay beyond, and he guided those who came after him 
in  search  of  the  Dreamtime.  He  himself  reputedly  returned 
home, several centuries ago.

The other brother, Kurulba, was a cruel, vindictive monster. 
He  waged  war  on  Kungaru  constantly,  and  after  his  brother 
moved on, sought to seize for himself the kingship of Karta. He 
could muster only a few wraiths to his cause, however, but to this 
day these Children of Kurulba continue to fight, murder, and 
mock wherever they may. They still seek rule over Karta, even 
though their leader has long since succumbed to his Shadow.

Western  wraiths  have  not  yet  found  their  way  to  Karta 
from Australia’s Shadowlands, though Aboriginal wraiths have 
been known to move back and forth. Native wraiths, however, 
shun the cities and are more likely to be found dealing with 
their business in the Outback.

Dreamtime

Dreamtime is at once a place and a state of being, where 
the  dead  of  Australia  pass  on  to  in  order  to  be  reborn  once 
they have moved on from earthly concerns. It is the present, 
the past and the world around them. Wraiths in Karta prepare 
to enter Dreamtime through resolving their links to the living 
world, as well as following those laws they may have ignored 
or broken in life.

Once a wraith is ready to journey to Dreamtime, he heads 
to one of several special caves dotting the island’s landscape. 
These caves lead straight to Dreamtime, and they are forbidden 
to those who have not yet prepared themselves for the journey 
by resolving the issues from their earthly existence. The Chil-
dren of Kurulba claim that the caves instead are simply Nihils 
leading to deep within the trackless Tempest, and that those 
who venture into them are instead simply lost.
Wulgaru

Wulgaru is the self-appointed judge of the dead, a creation 
of twisted magic. Made from carved wood, mud, river stones, 
and red-ochred wax, it roams the Outback, looking for Restless 
who  have,  in  its  somewhat  erratic  opinion,  broken  the  law. 
The definition of “breaking the law” wavers, as Wulgaru is an 
inconstant creature, but it often includes having dealings with 
the  Quick.  Should  the  wraith  be  found  guilty,  and  Wulgaru 
delivers its verdicts with great haste after short deliberation, the 
creature will attempt to devour the wraith in hopes of adding 
the guilty one’s Pathos to its own.

The Mirrorlands

he  wraiths  of  the  Caribbean  are,  by  and 
large, a mystery to those from outside. Their 
domain touches three continents and the 
whole of the Caribbean, a region thick with 
Spectres and home to some of the Tempest’s 
worst weather. To journey to the Mirrorlands 
takes strength, luck, determination, and a 
sure knowledge of the way, and these ingredients can be hard 
to find.

Residents of the Mirrorlands believe in reality as the Cosmic 
Mirror, its two sides being the Visible and Invisible. Each side 
can affect the other. Wraiths call themselves Les Invisibles, while 
the living are Les Chevaux, or the horses. They take this name 
from the habit of being Skinridden by Les Invisibles, as a rider 
mounts a horse. This ritual is of vital importance, providing 
benefits to both Les Invisibles and Les Chevaux in ways that 
go back centuries.

Metaphysics

When a person dies, it is their soul — the gros-bon-ange 
— that moves into the Invisible. The ti-bon-ange, essentially 
the conscience, separates (in most cases) and what is left is one 
indivisible soul with both good and bad. The Shadow is not to 
be destroyed, but rather accepted as part of the whole. Wraiths 
who succumb to their dark side are called Baka, though they 
are not hunted down. Rather, Les Invisibles’ unique Arcanos 
of Connaissance enables wraiths to defend themselves against 
the Baka’s predations.

If the wraith’s family wishes to stay in touch with them, 
they will contact a priest or houngan, to perform a ceremony 
called retirer d’en bas l’eau, “Reclaiming the soul from the waters 
of the Abyss.” This ties the gros-bon-ange to an earthenware 
pot known as a govi, which is then entrusted to living relatives. 
They in turn use it to contact the departed. Functionally, this 
establishes the govi as a Fetter for the wraith.

When  the  family  wishes  to  ask  something  of  the  ghost 
tied  to  the  govi,  they  return  to  the  houngan,  who  uses  it  to 
summon the wraith. Sacrifices of items — which materialize 
in the Invisible as useful relics — are made, as well as Pathos-
providing sacrifices of animals and food, which is devoured by 
Les Chevaux when mounted by the family ghost. In exchange 
for this, Les Invisibles share knowledge with and offer protec-
tion to their families.

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

455

Origins

The wraiths of the ancestors of those taken in human bondage 
Skinrode their descendants, unwilling to be separated from them. 
But in the Caribbean they found an inhospitable home. The Abyss 
was too dangerous to consider, while the Mirrorlands were constantly 
battered by Maelstroms and hordes of Baka. So many and so constant 
were  the  attacks  that  Les  Invisibles  decided  their  only  hope  for 
survival was to take the fight to the enemy, and wipe the Baka out 
at their source. During calm seasons in the Abyss, hunting parties 
went out, seeking the source of the floods of Baka. Many vanished 
or were destroyed, but one group found success.

Deep in the Abyss, a lone hunting party located an island that 
the Baka would not approach. Dwelling there on The Island Below 
the Sea were beings known as Les Mysteres, entities of immense 
power  who  were  nevertheless  unable  to  reach  the  Mirrorlands. 
They  proposed  a  bargain:  Bring  more  wraiths  to  the  island  and 
pledge to serve them, and in exchange receive knowledge and the 
ability to manipulate the Baka. Many wraiths took them up on this 
offer, learning the ways of Connaissance. Others were suspicious 
and  refused,  but  upon  their  attempt  to  return  home,  they  found 
they had been un-Fettered by their descendants’ forced conversion 
to the Christianity of their masters, and could no longer enter the 
Mirrorlands. With storm season in the Abyss approaching, these 
wraiths faced destruction. Thus was created the retirer d’en bas de 
l’eau, a way to Fetter older wraiths. Many were saved this way from 
the Abyss’s seasonal fury; many more were not. 

But  once  the  immediate  crisis  had  passed,  Les  Invisibles  set 
about  reconnecting  with  their  descendants.  Possession  through 
Puppetry became common, and the old rites and rituals were passed 
down. Both the living and the dead took strength from this, with 
Les Invisibles fanning the flames of revolt and resistance against 
the horrors of slavery.

Many years later, the first servant of Les Mysteres, calling herself 
a Loa, appeared. She repeated Les Mysteres’ offer and asked other 
wraiths to journey with her to the island. Some of the wraiths of 
the original hunting party remembered their suspicions and spoke 
against her, but still many wraiths heard her tales and journeyed 
with her to meet Les Mysteres. Now the majority of the wraiths 
of  the  Mirrorlands  view  Les  Mysteres  as  something  to  serve  and 
be served, and a seasonal traffic flows back and forth through the 
Abyss to the island.

Factions

There are two major factions among Les Invisibles, named after 
their founders. Those who follow Rada are suspicious of Les Mysteres. 
They hold a generally peaceful philosophy, and favor aiding their 
descendants and others among the living indirectly.

Followers of Petro, however, are more aggressive and interested 
in direct action. This faction appeals to a great many younger wraiths, 
and is considerably larger than the Rada faction. However, each 
side respects the other, and Les Chevaux call upon wraiths of both 

456

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

groups  for  assistance.  Rada  Invisibles  are  asked  for  guidance 
and healing, while Petro wraiths offer protection and strength. 
Some of Les Invisibles are also pledged to a Mystere. Such 
wraiths  are  called  Loa,  and  they  often  take  on  aspects  of  the 
personality of the power to which they have pledged themselves. 
Only those who devoutly wish to serve can become Loa, and they 
act as the eyes and ears of their Mystere in the Mirrorlands. When 
it is one of Les Invisibles who seeks guidance or knowledge, more 
often than not she will contact a Loa.

When the Abyss permits, there is plenty of traffic between 
the island and the Mirrorlands. Not only the Loa go. Others of 
Les Invisibles make the journey as well, looking for an audience 
with a Mystere, or to trade for the marvelous items found on the 
island, or simply to satisfy their curiosity. There are even those 
among Les Invisibles who have made the journey multiple times 
and who now serve as guides between the Mirrorlands and the 
Island, albeit for a price.

Cosmology

There are two aspects to the Cosmic Mirror, the Visible and 
the Invisible. The Invisible is made up of the Mirrorlands (the 
Shadowlands of the Caribbean) and the Abyss (The Tempest).
The Abyss is often roiled with storms and small Maelstroms, but 
these come in patterns matching the seasons. A wise wraith can 
usually tell if journeying into the Abyss is safe or not.

The Surface of the Mirror is the barrier between the Vis-
ible and the Invisible. In some places, it is thinner than others, 
and Les Invisibles can pass through more easily.  Many of these 
spots become the locations of temples set up by houngans, called 
Hounfors. Often a group of wraiths, called a Nanchon, will inhabit 
the Hounfor as a Haunt.

Arcanoi

hile the Arcanoi known in Stygia are also 
known in other afterlives, some of the Dark 
Kingdoms also have Arcanoi that are unique 
to them. Some of these are jealously guarded 
secrets, while others are better known, and 
when a non-Stygian wraith finds herself in 
the  Dark  Kingdom  of  Iron,  there  may  be 
considerable demand for her unique talents. Alternately, there 
could be pressure from local Hierarchs or Guildwraiths to shut 
her down. It all depends on circumstance and location.

Under very rare circumstances, if not specifically stated 
otherwise, Stygian wraiths may be able to learn some of the 
Arcanoi of other Dark Kingdoms. 

As far as Stygia knows, the non-Stygian Arcanoi do not 
have Guild equivalents (at least not in the Dark Kingdom of 
Iron). As such, they do not have Initiate arts, or at least not 
ones that are known in Stygia.

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

457

Arcanoi of the Jade Empire

With the exception of Castigate, all of the Arcanoi known 
and practiced in Stygia also have their adherents in the Jade 
Kingdom, though Yu Huang has ruthlessly rooted out even the 
slightest hint of Guild influence. Inhabit and Usury, while not 
unknown, are rarely used by upstanding wraiths, in as much as 
one is considered unseemly and there are superior alternatives 
to the other.

There are a half-dozen Arcanoi, however, that are native 
to  the  empire.  Four  are  based  on  Confucian  teachings,  the 
so-called Four Ways that reflect the four stations in society. 
These — the Ways of the Farmer, Merchant, Artisan, and 
Scholar  —  are  the  most  commonly  known  of  the  Jade 
Arcanoi. Less popular but equally potent is the Way of 
the Soul, which is derived instead from Taoist teachings. 
And restricted only to the Emperor’s Immortal Guard 
is the last, the fearsome Chains of the Emperor. Ru-
mors abound of those outside the Guard who have 
learned its secrets, but the official position is that 
such a deed would be impossible.

The Way of the Scholar

The Way of the Scholar is most often 
studied by magistrates, especially members 
of the Protectorate and Judges. It allows 
those who have developed their hun to 
become sensitive to others’ psyches, to the 
point  where  eventually  they  can  control 
others’ minds. 
• Discern the Lie

Discern  the  Lie  allows  the  Scholar  to  do 

exactly that: discover if someone speaking to her 
is in fact lying. 

System: To use Discern the Lie requires a Percep-
tion + Empathy roll, (difficulty 5 + the subject’s Subterfuge 
rating). A single success is enough to uncover falsehood, 
while  a  failure  is  inconclusive.  A  botch  will  produce  an 
incorrect  result,  which  can  have  all  sorts  of  consequences 
down the line.
•• Inquiry

Inquiry  allows  a  Scholar  to  force  a  subject  to  answer 
one question with absolute honesty. The target is allowed 
to express the truth however he sees fit, but he cannot lie. 
However,  this  still  leaves  broad  room  for  interpretation, 
meaning the Scholar had best choose the words of that single 
question carefully.

System: The wraith spends a point of Pathos and makes 
a Manipulation + Intimidation roll (difficulty of the subject’s 

Willpower).  A  single  success  allows  for  a  simple  question 
to be asked. More successes allow for more complexity. A 
botch drains a second Pathos point and adds one point of 
temporary Angst. 
••• Word of Yu Huang

With this power, the Scholar can issue a single com-
mand  to  the  subject  that  must  be  followed.  The  subject 
cannot  be  commanded  to  perform  a  self-destructive  act, 
and  they  are  free  to  take  advantage  of  any  ambiguity  in 
the Scholar’s phrasing. 

System: The Scholar makes a Manipulation + Leadership 
roll against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower. The more 
successes, the more complicated the command that can be 
given. One success allows for a one-word command, while 
five successes permits orders up to a paragraph in length. 
However, the order must be given (and will be followed) 
immediately.  If  the  order  is  not  given  at  once,  the 
power fades, leaving a resentful and angry subject.

The Scholar must spend 1 point of Pathos for 
every success gained on the roll, while each 1 
results in the acquisition of a point of temporary 
Angst. Those targeted by this power generally 
have no idea they have been manipulated 
thus  unless  the  Scholar  screws  up  the 
command, as above. 
•••• Filial Duty

An insidious use of the Arcanos, Fil-
ial Duty allows the Scholar to manipulate 
the hun of the target, making him willingly 
wish to cooperate with the Scholar. The sub-
ject can’t be forced to do things that directly 
contradict long-held convictions or positions, but 
he will assist the Scholar in all other things as if 
the Scholar were a respected member of his family. 
System: The Scholar makes a Charisma + Expres-
sion roll (difficulty of the subject’s Willpower), spends 3 
Pathos and 1 Willpower. The number of successes obtained 
determines how long the subject will remain sympathetic to 

the Scholar.
One Success: 
One Hour
Two Successes:  Six Hours
Three Successes:  One Day
Four Successes:  One Week
Five Successes:  One Month.

and creates a lifelong enemy. 

A botch gives the Scholar 3 additional temporary Angst, 

Once Filial Duty wears off, the target recognizes what has 

been done to her and reacts accordingly.

458

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

••••• The Emperor’s Servant

••• Rework Relics

Useful in creating Eunuchs for the Imperial Government, 
the Emperor’s Servant is an expression of mastery of manipu-
lating the hun. With this power in her arsenal, the wraith can 
fully control the minds of others, planting permanent orders 
within their minds. 

System: The action requires an entire day with the subject 
and costs 1 point of Willpower and 3 Pathos. To activate the 
power, the Scholar rolls Manipulation + Leadership against a 
difficulty of the subject’s Willpower + 2. The more successes 
gained,  the  more  complex  the  order  that  can  be  seamlessly 
implanted. This order cannot run contrary to the wraith’s con-
victions or personality, but anything else is fair game. A botch 
gives the Scholar an additional point of temporary Angst and 
costs a Willpower point for each 1 rolled.

The Way of the Artisan

The techniques for manipulating jade and relics are the 
purview of the Way of the Artisan. Through careful work with 
relics, White Jade, or even True Jade, an Artisan can create 
nearly anything. 

It is implicitly understood by all Artisans that everything 
in the afterlife is made from the souls of something from the 
living world, be it a mortal human or an object. Thus, once 
the Artisan comprehends the nature of the soul she is working 
with, she can shape it as desired.
• Shape True Jade

With enough time and raw material, an Artisan can use 
this power to create a simple object from True Jade. A handful 
of True Jade is not enough to make a sword, but master Artisans 
can make efficient use of what they are given.

System:  When  attempting  to  work  with  True  Jade,  the 
Artisan makes a Wits + Expression roll (difficulty 6). The num-
ber of successes needed depends on how complex the desired 
end product is. A failure means the working was unsuccessful, 
but the material has not been ruined and can be shaped into 
something  else.  A  botch  wrecks  the  True  Jade,  rendering  it 
useless for anything else. 
•• Work White Jade

This power allows the Artisan to work with White Jade 
just as the previous power covers True Jade. However, due to 
the inferior nature of the material, it takes three times as much 
White Jade as True Jade to create a given object.

Wraiths  who  have  mastered  Work  White  Jade  can  also 

work with the prepared Corpus of a kuei. 

System:  The  roll  and  results  are  the  same  as  for  Shape 

True Jade.

Using this power, the Artisan has the ability to work with 
objects made from something other than jade. A skilled Artisan 
can change the form and even the nature of a relic. 

System: The Artisan rolls Dexterity + Way of the Artisan 
(difficulty 7) to change a relic’s form. Modifying the material the 
relic is made from requires three or more successes on the same roll 
against a difficulty of 8. A failed roll leaves the relic as is, while 
a botch means that the relic has been functionally destroyed.
•••• Empower Jade

With this power, the Artisan can imbue jade items with 
Pathos  or  other  Arcanoi  that  she  might  possess.  Any  jade 
item — White or True — can be used to store the powers of a 
single Arcanos as well as the necessary Pathos fuel.  However, 
the Artisan can only infuse the item with her own Pathos and 
Arcanoi.

System: The Artisan spends 3 Pathos plus whatever he is 
investing in the item, and makes a Wits + Crafts roll. The dif-
ficulty is 5 for True Jade and 7 for White Jade. True Jade items 
can  maintain  the  power  imbued  in  them  indefinitely,  while 
White Jade items lose their powers after a number of months 
equal to twice the number of successes rolled. If the Artisan is 
attempting to imbue an Arcanos power, it costs a Willpower 
point plus another Pathos per level of the Arcanos power being 
imbued. Failure leaves the jade unempowered, while a botch 
drains an additional 3 Pathos points (to a minimum of 1) and 
adds a point of temporary Angst. 
••••• Create White Jade

A useful but terrifying power, Create White Jade allows 
an Artisan to craft a soul into White Jade. Before a soul can be 
transmogrified, it must have its spirit broken (Willpower and 
Pathos ratings of 0). Once that has been achieved, the Artisan 
spends three days working the unlucky soul into White Jade. 
System: To use Making White Jade requires a Manipula-
tion + Crafts roll (difficulty 6). When 10 total successes are 
gained across three days (the entire time must be invested), 
the effort is successful and the soul has transformed into White 
Jade. Roughly three pounds of White Jade emerge from each 
forged Corpus, and a botch during the process transforms the 
captive soul into a kuei. 

Before starting the process, the Artisan must identify what 
sort of White Jade she is creating, i.e. whether it is to be hard 
and rigid (useful for weapons and armor) or soft and flexible 
(best for furniture, garments, etc.). Once the decision has been 
made, it cannot be changed. 

Using  Making  White  Jade  gives  the  Artisan  a  point  of 

temporary Angst and costs 1 Pathos per day of the process.

The Way of the Farmer

While Scholars work the hun, Farmers work the p’o. Using 
fear and intimidation, Farmers harness and train untamed souls. 
They have a particular knack for Reaping and wrangling kuei. 
• Finding the Hidden Ghost

This ability allows the Farmer to sense the location of kuei 
and those wraiths who are currently being controlled by their p’o.
System: The wraith makes a Perception + Investigation roll 
(difficulty 6) to sense the location of every being within range 
that is dominated by their p’o (or Shadow). This includes kuei, 
Spectres, and wraiths in Catharsis. Each success on the roll expands 
the radius of the sphere of detection by 15 feet. Failure on the 
roll returns no information, while a botch either provides false 
positives or causes the wraith to miss targets she’d normally spot. 
•• Cowing the Bestial Spirit

By using forceful, direct language, the Farmer can intimidate 
any kuei or other wild soul into not attacking. In some cases, 
the Farmer can even command the obedience of the target. 

System: The Farmer makes a Charisma + Intimidation roll 
(difficulty 7) and speaks in a threatening manner to the target. 
The effects of the power last 10 minutes per success rolled. The 
number of successes determine the effect.
One Success: 
The subject flees in terror.
Two Successes:  The  subject  cannot  advance  toward  the  

Farmer, and may only retreat slowly.

Three Successes:  The subject is frozen in place.
Four Successes:  The  Farmer  may  render  the  subject  

 

 

 

 

“unconscious.”

Five Successes:  The Farmer can control the subject’s movements.
The  power  costs  1  Pathos.  On  a  failure,  the  Farmer  is 
ignored. A botch gives the Farmer a point of temporary Angst 
and causes the target to attack immediately.
••• Purify

This  power  has  the  effect  of  reducing  a  p’o’s  temporary 

Angst score. It has no effect on permanent Angst. 

System: The Storyteller rolls the Farmer’s Charisma + Way 
of the Farmer against the subject’s permanent Angst score. Each 
success removes a Corpus level and 1 temporary Angst from 
the target. Any 1 rolled gives a point of temporary Angst to 
the Farmer. This power costs 1 Willpower.
•••• Deaden Spirit

With this power, the Farmer soothes the savage p’o through calm 
and soothing words. This deadens the raging jealousy and hatred 
that power them, bringing them some form of temporary peace. 

System: The Farmer makes a Charisma + Empathy roll 
(difficulty 8) and spends a point of Pathos. On a success, the 
Farmer mollifies the beast, deadening its emotions and caus-
ing it to calm down. The target will take no violent action for 

a period of one turn per success scored, instead muttering to 
itself or just curling up and grumbling. A failure has no effect 
on the target. A botch causes the target to attack immediately, 
and gives the Farmer 3 temporary Angst.
••••• Reap the Hungry Ghost

With  Reap  the  Hungry  Ghost,  the  Farmer  may  render 
down the Corpora of kuei into rough blobs that can be easily 
transported or stored. This power only works on subdued kuei, 
preferably those that have been deadened, and does not work 
on wraiths controlled by their p’o or on Spectres. 

System:  To  render  down  a  kuei,  the  Farmer  spends  two 
points of Pathos and rolls Manipulation + Crafts (difficulty 7).  
This power also requires half an hour per Corpus level harvested. 
With success, the kuei is worked down into an easily transport-
able lump. A botch ruins the Corpus being worked and gives 
the Farmer a temporary point of Angst.

The Way of the Merchant

In  the  Middle  Kingdom,  the  Merchant  serves  as  an  es-
sential  middleman.  While  the  Arcanos  may  not  come  with 
the respect given to practitioners of other arts, every wraith 
in Yu Huang’s realm must know someone with access to this 
Arcanos or they will be unable to use the sacrifices their living 
relatives make to them. 
• Transfer

With Transfer, a Merchant may give Pathos or take it from 
another  wraith  as  desired.  This  power  only  works  on  direct 
contact regardless of whether the target is willing or unwill-
ing, and a yellowish glow is emitted from the point of where 
the two touch. 

System: To perform a Transfer, the Merchant rolls Manipu-
lation + Way of the Merchant. To give Pathos, the difficulty is 
the Wraith’s current Pathos rating. To steal it, the target dif-
ficulty is the subject’s Willpower. Each success rolled translates 
into 1 point of Pathos that can be transferred. Each 1 rolled 
gives the Merchant a point of temporary Angst. Transfer costs 
1 Willpower to use.
•• Cash Money

The  most  popular  ability  in  the  Way  of  the  Merchant, 
Cash  Money  is  where  most  Merchants  stop  their  studies.  It 
allows the wraith to fully utilize any sacrifices made by living 
relatives, converting them directly into Pathos, which can be 
kept or shared with another wraith as needed.

System:  Converting  a  sacrifice  into  Pathos  requires  a 
Manipulation + Way of the Merchant roll versus the number of 
Pathos points in the sacrifice. A success means that the sacrificed 
item has been transformed into its equivalent in Pathos. Once 
this has been done, Transfer can be used to share the Pathos 
with other wraiths. If Transfer isn’t used, the Merchant simply 
keeps the Pathos. Each 1 rolled causes the loss of a point of 
Pathos from the sacrifice.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

••• Withdraw Essence

With this power, the Merchant can pull Pathos from the 
Corpus of kuei that has been converted by a Farmer, or from 
raw, unshaped White Jade. White Jade that has been worked 
cannot be used for this, nor can a kuei that has already been 
forged into a new form. 

System: The Merchant spends a Willpower point and then 
makes a Manipulation + Way of the Merchant roll. The dif-
ficulty is 5 + the number of Pathos points to be gained. Thus, 
an attempt to gain 1 point of Pathos would have a difficulty of 
6, 2 points would be at a difficulty of 7, etc. On a botch, each 
1 rolled adds a point of temporary Angst. 
•••• Returning the Favor

Returning the Favor does exactly what its name implies, 
allowing a Merchant to send Pathos back across the Shroud 
to a mortal. The results of this transfusion vary, based on how 
much Pathos is given, but the boost of emotional energy given 
the mortal is always beneficial.

1 point will allow a mortal to reduce the difficulty of a 

single action by 1.

2 points will allow the mortal to reroll a failed dice roll.
3 points of Pathos will restore a point of Willpower.
A  Merchant  can  return  a  maximum  of  3  points  at  any 

given time. 

System:  Returning  the  Favor  requires  only  that  the 
wraith be within five feet of her target. She spends a Pathos 
and a Willpower point, then rolls Charisma + Empathy (dif-
ficulty equal to the number of Pathos transferred + 4). A 
failure means no Pathos was transferred, and a botch gives 
the Merchant temporary Angst equivalent to the number 
of 1s rolled.
••••• Mint Money

Mint Money lets the Merchant turn Pathos into physical 
tokens that can be easily transferred. Wads of paper money 
and  strings  of  coins  are  common,  though  other  forms  are 
sometimes used as well. Indeed, some Merchants make distinct 
tokens that serve as their signatures, which can then be seen 
as a sign of quality. 

System: To use this art, the Merchant spends 2 Pathos 
and  a  Willpower  point,  then  rolls  Manipulation  +  Way  of 
the  Farmer  (difficulty  of  the  amount  of  Pathos  converted 
+ 4). The wraith’s own Pathos then drains out of them and 
manifests as freshly minted currency. It will last in this form 
for  one  day  per  success.  A  failure  results  in  the  loss  of  the 
Pathos  the  Merchant  was  attempting  to  convert.  A  botch 
gives the Merchant 2 temporary Angst points for each point 
of Pathos lost. 

The Way of the Soul

Unlike the other four Ways, the Way of the Soul is not 
grounded in Confucian teachings. Rather, it is based in Taoist 
thought, enabling Jade wraiths to battle their own demons 
rather than turning to outsiders to assist them. It is rare for a 
follower of the Way of the Soul to be able to affect another’s 
p’o, but mastery of the art gives a wraith considerable power 
over her own.
• Coax

Coax allows the wraith to modify the number of Shadow 
Dice its p’o offers, thus allowing the wraith to minimize certain 
risks taken when dealing with one’s dark side.

System: To use Coax, roll Way of the Soul against a dif-
ficulty  of  6.  Each  success  allows  another  die  to  be  removed 
from or added to the Shadow Dice pool. Use of Coax adds 1 
temporary Angst point.
•• Nullify Thorns

Through the use of this power, a wraith is temporarily able 

to prevent her p’o from using one of its Thorns.

System: The wraith spends a point of Pathos, then makes 
a contested roll of a wraith’s Stamina + Meditation versus her 
temporary Angst. If successful, the wraith can prevent the use 
of a single Thorn for one half hour per success. On a botch, the 
p’o gains a point of temporary Angst. 
••• Give Higher Passions

The wraith can use this power to attempt to induce some 
of his own Passions into the p’o, temporarily replacing one of 
its Dark Passions.

System: To successfully implant a Passion, a wraith must 
spend 2 Pathos and make a Manipulation + Meditation roll 
versus a difficulty of the p’o’s temporary Angst + 2 (maximum 
10). Each success rolled equals one day that the wraith’s Passion 
replaces her choice of the p’o’s Dark Passion. A botch results 
in the wraith gaining 2 temporary Angst.
•••• Alter Demeanor

With this power, the wraith can talk to her p’o in such 
a way that it cares about different things, such as love and 
accomplishment instead of simple envy and hatred. By doing 
so, the wraith can make the p’o take on a new Archetype 
for an extended period of time, even one normally reserved 
for the hun. 

System: This art costs 3 Pathos, and requires a Manipula-
tion + Persuasion roll against a difficulty of the p’o’s Angst + 
4 [maximum 10]. For each success, the effect lasts for a week. 
However, if the player botches, then the p’o gains 4 temporary 
Angst. Even if the player merely fails without botching, she 
still gains 1 temporary Angst.

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

461

••••• Inner Peace

Rather than standing in opposition to an assertive p’o, Inner 
Peace allows the hun to join with it, allowing the two halves 
of the wraith’s soul to act as a unified whole. This moment of 
unity often reminds the p’o of days gone by, making it reluctant 
to act aggressively against its other half.

System: The wraith makes an opposed roll of his Will-
power versus the p’o’s Angst. The player gets Pathos from both 
his Dark Passions and his hun’s Passions, and may use both 
his own Arcanos and the p’o’s Thorns, drawing upon both 
his temporary Angst and his Pathos. The wraith may not be 
entirely in control of himself during this phase, but the p’o is 
not in control either. 

The joining of the two aspects ends when the wraith ex-
hausts all of the p’o’s temporary Angst, or 24 hours have passed. 
A failed roll on Inner Peace rouses the p’o to new heights of 
fury; a botch gives it immediate control and 3 additional points 
of temporary Angst to play with. 

Chains of the Emperor

It is said that only members of the Immortal Guard have 
access to the powers of Chains of the Emperor. Created by the 
Emperor himself, in conjunction with Fu Xia, this Arcanos is 
designed to subdue, not kill. In that, it is extraordinarily effective. 
• Brilliance

While  the  eerily  painted  forms  of  the  Immortal  Guard 
are already brighter than is normal for the Underworld, with 
Brilliance  comes  an  enhanced  glow  that  shines  out  brightly 
enough to blind enemies.

System: This process takes three turns to reach full bright-
ness.  At  their  full  brilliance,  the  colors  blind  all  those  near 
the Guardsman who do not make a Stamina roll (difficulty 7). 
Attacks against the Guard when Brilliance has been activated 
have their difficulty increased by 1 for the first two turns the art 
is in play, and by 2 for each consecutive turn after that. It costs 
1 Pathos to use Brilliance for five turns, and a botch blinds the 
Guardsman for one turn per botch.
•• Shackles

Using some of his own Corpus, the Guardsman can create 
a pair of shackles with which he may bind either the hands or 
feet of an opponent who has already been immobilized. These 

cannot be removed by anyone but a Guardsman unless rent 
through the use of Moliate. The shackles share the same eerie 
color scheme as the Guardsman.

System: The Guardsman rolls Dexterity + Chains of the 
Emperor (difficulty 5) to manifest the shackles and place them 
on an immobilized foe. Shackles take one turn to place on the 
subject.  They  cost  2  Corpus  and  1  Pathos.  A  failure  results 
in the loss of 2 points of Corpus, while a botched attempt at 
Shackles causes the Guardsman to lose the 2 points of Corpus 
as aggravated damage. 
••• Snare

With Snare, the Guardsman can cancel out another wraith’s 
ability to use Argos. Tactically, it’s used to keep enemies from 
fleeing the field of battle or prisoners from trying to escape hell. 
System: Any wraith the Guardsman is in physical contact 
with (this includes Shackles) must win an opposed Strength + 
Brawl roll with the Guard or she will be unable to use Argos. 
•••• Lariat

Similar to Shackle but useful up to a distance of 50 feet, 
Lariat can be used on a moving target. To use Lariat, the Guard 
takes part of his Corpus and flings it at the target. 

System: Successful use of Lariat costs 1 Pathos and 2 Corpus, 
and requires a successful Dexterity + Chains of the Emperor 
roll (difficulty 7). Each 1 rolled is taken by the Guardsman as 
a level of regular damage.
••••• Net

This Art has a shorter range but a wider effect than Lariat. 
It can be flung 20 feet, but consists of a net rather than a single 
pair of shackles, and thus can be used to target a group of wraiths. 
System: With an expenditure of 3 points of Pathos, the 
Guardsman produces a colorful web, 12 feet in diameter. The 
Guardsman then casts this net at his targets, using a Dexterity 
+ Chains roll (difficulty 6). The net completely ensnares any 
victim it touches, wrapping around them with sticky fibers so 
that they are completely immobilized. 

Breaking a strand of the net requires a successful Strength 
+ Brawl roll. It takes between three and six successes to escape 
the net completely. True Jade can be used to cut the net, though 
White Jade will shatter on the attempt. 

A botched attempt at using Net gives the Guard 3 health 

levels of aggravated damage, as well as 2 temporary Angst.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Arcanoi of Svarga: Displace

isplace  combines  elements  of  Inhabit, 
Moliate, and Usury. In Svarga, the Arcanos’ 
chief use is for “creating” all the splendid 
“foods”  and  comfortable  accoutrements 
which  characterize  that  Dark  Kingdom. 
Basically,  wraiths  who  belong  to  that 
kingdom but who attempt one of the three 

aforementioned Arcanoi in Stygia find themselves facing 
certain restrictions and having certain advantages — none 
of which apply to Stygian wraiths. Conversely, no Stygian 
wraith can ever practice the art of the Tvashtriya.
Tvashtriya

Death  strands  numerous  Rajput,  Punjabi, 

and Bengali troops and trench-diggers — whom 
the  British  export  from  colonial  India  —  in 
the Dark Empire of Iron. Unlike wraiths of 
the other Dark Kingdoms who turn up in 
Stygia, the Tvashtriya are not necessarily 
Renegades in the Dark Kingdom of Iron. 
Stygia has no treaties with Svarga, so the 
Hierarchy  isn’t  opposed  to  seeing  such 
wraiths enthralled or integrated into the 
bureaucracy in more pleasant ways. However, 
all Tvashtriya experience dreams of Svarga, 
with its seeming ease and plenty. Stygia’s rela-
tive bleakness is something to be fled for most 
of these wraiths.

Once such wraiths master their Arcanos, they 
can render another wraith into amorphous soulstuff, 
a substance they can then reshape into all manner of 
Artifacts. What distinguishes Displace from Moliate and 
Usury is that a Tvashtriya must wraithride a target before 
he can have any other effect on her. Every aspect of this art 
involves wraithly Corpora.

A Tvashtriya wraithriding another faces risks similar to the 
ones that affect someone who is Straddling: Damage inflicted 
on the ridden wraith affects the wraithrider equally. This rule 
includes  Arcanos  damage  such  as  what  Early  Withdrawal 
might inflict (i.e., a Usurer directing that art at someone who 
is wraithridden gets double Corpus levels). Tvashtriya cannot 
insert their Corpora into mortals, relics or Artifacts. 

Practitioners of Displace obviously make great spies, a fact 
that makes these wraiths welcome in any Renegade Circle and 
hunted by the Legions. The Artificers’, Usurers’, and Masquers’ 
Guilds pursue them relentlessly in effort to learn the Displace 

Arcanos — which they can never do. Many individual wraiths 
are uncomfortable with the invasiveness of the Arcanos and 
therefore seek Moliation by Tvashtriya — or Pathos infusion 
from them — only as a last resort.

Botches
Depending on what a Tvashtriya is attempting inside 
another wraith, botches can have a range of results. Typi-
cally, a botch causes a boomerang effect wherein attempted 
theft of Pathos drains it from the Tvashtriya or efforts 
to infuse a wraith with Corpus instead drain the target 
of health. Nasty failures can trap a displacer inside 

his subject.
• Wraithride

A Tvashtriya who can make contact with 
the Corpus of another wraith can invade the 
target’s Corpus and remain there for an in-
definite time. A successful wraithrider finds 
herself in a dark, quiet place. Normally, 
she has no perception of events outside 
the host wraith except for the host’s entry 
into Slumber (which causes a Displacer’s 
“environment”  to  brighten)  and  attempts 
to  detect  the  rider’s  presence  (which  the 

Displacer might notice as a buzzing noise). 

Wraithride provides no control or influence 
over the host wraith. It also exposes the rider to 
all damage the host wraith suffers, including Har-
rowings and theft of Corpus or Pathos. Also, should a 
wraithriding Tvashtriya fall into a Harrowing, she drags 
her host along with her. A Usurer who receives “extra 
Pathos” from a wraith can sometimes infer the additional 

presence of a wraithrider. 

System: The player rolls Stealth + Displace to invade a tar-
get’s Corpus. The number of successes achieved must be exceeded 
in a resisted roll for another wraithrider to force the first out of 
the host. Although a successful wraithrider can be intentionally 
detected only through the use of Sense Rider, a wraith who uses 
Transfer (or other applicable Usury ability) on a ridden wraith 
can determine the presence of a rider in her target’s Corpus with 
a successful Intelligence + Usury roll (difficulty 8).
•• Deflect

Deflect  allows  a  Tvashtriya  to  combat  others’  attempts 
to  sense  his  presence  when  he’s  riding  an  object  or  another 

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

463

Tvashtriyawraith. This art also lets a wraith channel damage from his 
own Corpus to that of a wraith he’s in contact with as the 
damage occurs. 

System: Obviously, a Tvashtriya must first successfully 
ride an object or Corpus before he can attempt to deflect 
efforts at detection. Also, he must realize that someone is 
attempting to detect him, which requires one success on 
a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 6). To avoid 
detection, the player makes a contested roll 
of his character’s Manipulation + Displace 
against the seeker’s Perception + Inhabit 
or Perception + Displace, as appropriate. 
Detection by a Usurer cannot be deflected; 
in that instance, the cat — or, rather, the 
Corpus level/ Pathos — has already left 
the bag. It’s up to the Usurer to make 
sense of the excess profit.

To  deflect  damage,  the  wraith 
must  make  physical  contact  with  a 
target who can receive it (the wraith-
rider  cannot  deflect  damage).  The 
player rolls Manipulation + Displace. 
The number of successes equals the 
number of Corpus levels of damage 
the Displacer can channel.
••• Transfuse

A  Tvashtriya  riding  another 
wraith’s Corpus can lend Pathos to 
her host or take Pathos from her host. 
If the host is not in Slumber at the 
moment of transferal, he can notice 
the event, as can onlookers. Bestowal 
of  Pathos  produces  a  momentary 
scintillation around the host’s Cor-
pus, whereas theft of Pathos causes 
fleeting waves of darkness to sweep 
across the host’s Corpus. 

System: Once the Tvashtriya 
is successfully wraithriding a target, 
the player rolls Stamina + Displace 
to bestow Pathos or Dexterity + Dis-
place to steal Pathos. The difficulty 
to  bestow  Pathos  equals  the  host’s 
current Pathos, whereas the difficulty to steal 
Pathos equals the host’s Willpower.

Pathos theft with this art grants the Tvash-

triya 1 temporary Angst.
•••• Reconfigure

With  Reconfigure,  a  Tvashtriya  can 

make various changes to his host’s Corpus. 
Minor alterations can be effected during 
the host’s Slumber without rousing the host. 

Such changes include making part or all of the host’s 
Corpus  luminescent  (as  with  the  Moliate  ability 
Glow),  transparent  (to  let  the  Displacer  visually 
reconnoiter his surroundings; a wraithrider looking 
out while her host Slumbers inside a Fetter sees only 
impenetrable darkness), or resonant (so he can hear 
the host’s surroundings; dead silence means the host 
is inside a Fetter). Any more extensive alteration at-
tempted with Reconfigure on a wraith in Slumber 
may rouse the host. Major alterations with this 
art include new appendages or sensory organs, 
modified  teeth  or  extremities.  A  favorite 
Tvashtriya trick is to make the host resemble 
the  Displacer,  then  abandon  the  lookalike 
host, who serves as a decoy.

System:  Once  a  character  has  suc-
cessfully  wraithridden  a  host,  the  player 
rolls Intelligence + Displace (difficulty 7), 
with the number of successes required to be 
determined by the Storyteller, based on the 
goal  of  the  Tvashtriya.  Changes  made  with 
Reconfigure to the host’s Corpus can likewise 
be  undone  with  Reconfigure  or  the  Moliate 
ability Sculpt. Otherwise, Reconfigure’s effects 
are permanent. If a Tvashtriya attempts to use 
Reconfigure on a host in Slumber, the target’s 
player should roll Perception + Awareness and 
be roused on a successful roll (difficulty 8).

This art costs 1 Pathos to use, and the host 
loses 1 Corpus level. Use of Reconfigure on an 
unwilling host grants the Displacer 2 temporary 
Angst; on a willing host, 1 temporary Angst.
••••• Transmogrify

Masters  of  Displace  can  change  a  host’s 
corpus into nearly anything (mostly inanimate 
stuff,  though),  including  a  form  that  can  be 
consumed for Pathos “nourishment.”

System: Once a character has successfully 
wraithridden a host, the player makes a contested 
Wits + Displace roll against the host character’s 
Willpower (difficulty 7 for both). Three or more 
net  successes  for  the  Tvashtriya  allow  her  to 
render the host into an “edible” form that grants 
Pathos to the consumer.

Many users render a target into a form re-
sembling a cluster of grapes. Each “fruit” a wraith 
ingests confers 1 Pathos; a cluster contains one 
grape per point of Pathos the target possessed 

at the time of transmogrification.

Any use of Transmogrify costs 2 Pathos 
and  grants  the  Tvashtriya  3  temporary 
Angst.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Arcanoi of the Bush of Ghosts: Behest

he  African  ibambo  is  a  four-part  entity 
combining  a  soul’s  “immortal  essence,” 
the dark “shadowself,” the sleep-traveling 
“dreamself” and the entwining “heartlife” 
that bridges the physical and spiritual worlds. 
Much of living Africa, conceiving the world 
to  be  abundant  with  spirits,  sees  each 

animal and plant as housing a soul of its own. Thus, their 
human dead do not leave the living world behind; they 
merely slough the body from themselves and reside in a 
“spirit Africa.” They respond when properly called by 
one among the Quick — a medicine man or witch 
doctor — or among the dead — the wraith known 
as a Moriman. Belief spins reality in the intricate 
Web  of  the  Dead.  With  Behest,  abambo  can 
intimately  sense  the  strands  touching  every 
wraith... and pull!

Behest is an Arcanos that melds aspects 

of  Lifeweb,  Puppetry,  and  Fatalism.  It 
parallels the practice among the Quick 
of bewitching others through effigies or 
personal belongings, for both derive from 
the  African  understanding  that  a  person 
is a spirit who affects (and can be affected 
by)  the  spiritual  realm  of  the  world.  In  the 
Skinlands, menstrual blood buried or washed 
away in a river, cut hair and fingernail clippings 
secretly buried in the earth, and bodily remains 
completely  disposed  of  by  scavenger  or  flame  all 
ensure the owner’s spirit cannot be abused by magic 
that  incorporates  these  materials.  Precious  items  or 
personal weapons are often burned or buried with their 
owners, in part for respect, but also for security. Caring for 
things, holding them “close to the heart,” imbues them with 
a link to the human spirit that still binds in death.

This  link  applies  all  the  more  so  to  wraiths.  African 
wraiths can sense, with their heartlife, the imbued connec-
tion of all things in the Underworld. The truly gifted master 
of Behest can even follow the lines of spiritual bonds to living 
Fetters  across  the  Shroud.  Although  any  wraith  may  learn 
from skilled Puppeteers to manipulate unsuspecting Quick, 
only the abambo may do such to another wraith. Individuals 
learned in Behest find employment as the most valuable as-
sassins, extortionists, and saboteurs among the dead. Location, 
physical manipulation, and energy drain are potent weapons 

against an unsuspecting wraith… especially when the target 
can be utterly destroyed from a distance. 

The average wraith lavishes intense concern on her Fet-
ters, people, or objects of importance on the other side of the 
Shroud,  while  being  relatively  oblivious  about  the  persons 
and things of similar importance to them in the Underworld. 
Behest  affects  the  Shadowlands  and  their  residents.  An 
ibambo toying with Behest outside the Bush of Ghosts is 
ignorant and free of the stringent laws that restrict abuse 

of the Arcanos.

Like  a  neighborhood  of  gun  owners,  crime  is 
low in the Dark Kingdom of Ivory; knowing that 
everyone  is  similarly  armed  keeps  miscreants  in 
line. On the other hand, Europeans are not taught 
the  importance  of  protecting  their  cherished 
objets de morts. For most Moriman dwelling in 
Stygia, the combination of vengeance and 
advantage afforded them by their power 

is simply too much to resist. 

The Western mind sees death as the 
absence of life. Africans know death is 
still part of the Web of Life, but, for one 
who is dead, there is also access to the Web 
of Death. Normally, these abambo would have 
become revered witch doctors, spiritualists, or 
spellcasters for their tribal faction in the Bush of 
Ghosts. But without the framework or guidance 
of  the  Dark  Kingdom  of  Ivory,  a  practitioner  of 
Behest in the European Underworld is left to carve 

his own niche.

Aware  of  the  premium  placed  on  their  services, 
bold  Moriman  abandon  the  uniform  shirts  they  wore 
upon awakening in Stygia. They display their distinctive 
Arcanos markings with pride and defiance — for few wraiths 
are foolish enough to draw the wrath of Behest’s masters. Of 
course, a few individuals manifest in tribal garb from the start. 
Right Hand / Left Hand

There are two Hands in the art of Behest: location and 

manipulation.

The ability to master each Hand is enhanced by the object 
with which the Arcanos is being guided, and the expertise of 
the Moriman herself. But one must exercise both Hands equally 
in order to be truly strong. The Right Hand seeks and finds. 
The Left Hand steers and strikes.

THE OTHER DARK KINGDOMS

MorimanBotches
Botch  results  vary  considerably  depending  upon 

what aspect of the Behest Arcanos was (unsuccessfully) 
attempted. Most often, the target wraith simply cannot 
be located, leaving a cold trail or sometimes a false one. 
Mimicry is the curse of Moriman who flub efforts to 
control another wraith. That is, the target unknow-
ingly dictates the motions of the Moriman.
This outcome can be merely hu-
miliating  or  completely  disastrous. 
Behest is a superb weapon, as long as 
you can avoid being its target.

Restrictions
Lifeweb  and  Fatalism  cannot  be 
practiced  by  an  ibambo  in  any  other 
fashion than through the channels of 
Behest.  Puppetry,  on  the  other  hand, 
is an element of Behest, but may also be 
taken  as  a  separate  Arcanos  to  be  used 
specifically on the living. Behest is purely 
a manipulation of wraithly and soulstuff ener-
gies; Puppetry affects the living, man or beast. 
These fields of play are separate, and both 
are open to the ibambo Moriman.

Behest has no spatial range or limita-
tion  to  its  use  —  as  long  as  the  target  is 
somewhere on the planet, it can be found. 
What  varies  is  how  much  time  may  be 
required to follow the connective strands 
to their source; the closer in proximity the 
Moriman is to his target, the sooner the task 
may be accomplished. The target “eluding” 
Behest is the cover-up term for a Moriman’s 
failure to produce results. And in the Euro-
pean hells, time is not to be wasted, for as 
long as an African wraith remains outside 
the Bush of Ghosts, his very soul mutates 
into the dead soul of a Stygian wraith, into 
Psyche and Shadow. With their four-part self 
vanishes the ability to ply Behest. Practice 
of this Arcanos is a finite trade outside the 
Dark Kingdom of Ivory, and clients must 
pay handsomely for the Moriman’s sacrifice 
of precious time.
• Delve

A Moriman armed with the appro-

priate link to another wraith can enter 
a trance state and experience what that 
wraith has recently undergone. Although 
Delve  lets  the  practitioner  detect  the 
recent surroundings — and feelings — of her 

target,  this  Right-Hand  art  does  not  confer  “mind-
reading” abilities or control of any sort. 

System: The player needs at least one success 
on an Intelligence + Meditation roll (difficulty 6) 
before she can attempt Delve. Thereafter, she rolls 
Empathy + Behest (difficulty varies; see chart). One 
success bestows the target’s recent mood. Two successes 
give visual impressions, including faces the target saw 
and details about his environment. Three successes 
add fragments of auditory information to the 
mix  —  incomplete  sentences  and  ambient 
noise,  for  example.  Four  successes  vividly 
recreate the target’s surroundings, and five or 
more successes reveal when the target had 
this  experience  and  how  he  felt  during  it. 
This art costs 1 Pathos.
•• Trace
By grasping an item belonging to the wraith 
under  examination,  or  by  occupying  a  space  re-
cently vacated by that individual, the Moriman can 
determine his target’s current location. When using 
an object, the practitioner must surround it with a 
nimbus of exhaled smoke; when using a locale, he 
must occupy the exact space that the target did and 
surround himself with smoke. Within the exhaled 
cloud, the strands of Fate glow and shift. The strand 
that extends outside the smoke leads to the target.
System: Roll Investigation + Behest (diffi-
culty varies; see chart). One success merely points 
in  the  target’s  direction,  whereas  five  successes 
establish a glowing thread between the practitio-
ner and the sought wraith. A player may not turn 
down successes, so extreme success can have the 
disadvantage of alerting a target (who needs only one 
success on a Perception + Alertness roll [difficulty 
5] to realize something’s up). However, a player can 
use less than his total dice pool for the roll. Strands 
made visible by Trace remain that way for a number 
of scenes equal to successes on the roll. This art costs 
1 corpus and 1 Pathos.
••• Scry

The third level of the Right Hand lets a Moriman 
with a usable link enter a trance state to simultaneously 
perceive  what  another  wraith  perceives.  Scry,  like 
Delve, does not make the practitioner aware of 
a target’s thoughts, but it does reveal some of 
the descried wraith’s emotions.

All successfully applied Behest arts, Right 
Hand  and  Left  at  this  level  of  expertise  and 
higher, are visible to other wraiths using Soulsight. 
A glimpse with Soulsight at a wraith “invaded” by 
a Moriman’s consciousness shows knotted strands 

466

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

shaped just like the ones that merge on the practitioner’s chest 
(no two Moriman have identical Arcanos markings), but radi-
ant, not dark. The Shadows of a Moriman and her target can 
communicate freely during any use of Scry. 

System: The player needs at least one success on an Intel-
ligence + Meditation roll (difficulty 6) before she can attempt 
Scry. Thereafter, roll Empathy + Behest (difficulty varies; see 
chart). The target may make a Perception + Subterfuge roll 
(difficulty  6)  to  realize  someone  is  using  Scry  on  him.  One 
success allows the target to make a Willpower roll to resist the 
Behest user. Should the Moriman win this contest, her successes 
determine the amount of information she receives exactly as 
they do with Delve. Scry lasts for a number of turns equal to 
successes on the Empathy + Behest roll. This art costs 2 Pathos 
and 1 Willpower.
•••• Divine

Although  rumor  has  it  that  further  Right-Hand  powers 
exist for practitioners of Behest in the Bush of Ghosts, Divine 
is the uppermost such ability for a Moriman dwelling in Stygia. 
It allows the user a glimpse of what Fate holds in store, either 
for the Moriman herself or for another wraith. Practice of this 
art does not require a link, only meditation upon the individual 
seeking divination. After meditating, the Moriman expels smoke 
that coalesces into a scene of the future.

System: The player needs at least one success on an Intel-
ligence + Meditation roll (difficulty 6) before she can attempt 
Divine.  Thereafter,  roll  Intelligence  +  Behest  (difficulty  8). 
One success gives a blurry tableau, whereas three allow a silent 
play in miniature, complete with recognizable individuals and 
settings.  The  smoke  representation  endures  for  a  number  of 
turns equal to successes on the roll. This art costs 1 Corpus, 2 
Pathos, and 1 Willpower.
••• Twitch

Use of the Left Hand stems from mastery of the Right Hand 
— a Moriman cannot affect wraiths she cannot find. Thus, the 
practitioner must first successfully Scry her target. The effects 
of Twitch on a victim are limited to the most minor of bodily 
manipulations: a stumble, a rolling of the eyes, an irritating 
tingle... Such changes are tiny, but potentially devastating if 
well-timed  and  ill-intentioned.  Moriman  dabbling  with  the 
Left  Hand  routinely  cause  missteps  that  throw  unsuspecting 
wraiths into walls or other wraiths, and off staircases into space.
System: After successfully using Scry on the target, roll 
Dexterity + Behest (difficulty varies; see chart). At this point, 
the target (if aware of what’s happening) gets a second chance 
to use Willpower to resist the Moriman. The number of net 
successes determines what minor Corpus stimuli or spasms the 
Moriman may cause, and to what degree. One success might 

cause the target only to nudge that jugged Spectre someone fool-
ishly left on the parapet, yet fail to push the container off. Two 
successes make the action more of an elbow lunge, something 
a suspicious onlooker might believe was intentional. Three or 
more successes take things up to an open-handed shove. Players 
should be encouraged to pantomime whatever actions they wish 
the target to commit; irritations are portrayed by the Moriman 
player pinching or tickling herself. This art costs 1 Pathos and 
confers 1 point of temporary Angst.
•••• Murmur

The second level of the Left Hand lets the Moriman speak 
through another wraith’s mouth (or whatever orifice the target 
commonly uses). The practitioner’s utterances sound exactly like 
the victim, unless the Behest user consciously wills otherwise.
System: The Moriman must successfully Scry the target. 
Thereafter,  roll  Intelligence  +  Behest  (difficulty  varies;  see 
chart). As with Twitch, the target may resist with Willpower. 
The number of net successes determines the number of turns 
that the Moriman may speak through the target. This art costs 
2 Pathos, and it confers 1 point of temporary Angst.
••••• Veer

Through exertion of will and mastery of her Arcanos, the 
Moriman makes another wraith into a puppet squatted upon the 
practitioner’s expert hand. Veer encompasses all wraithly “mo-
tor skills,” and it allows the user of this art to march her victim 
into the nearest Nihil, or to defend himself from an attack that 
the Moriman anticipates but that the target of Veer does not.
System:  Once  the  Moriman  succeeds  in  using  Scry  on 
the target, roll Dexterity + Behest (difficulty varies; see chart). 
As  with  Twitch,  the  target  may  resist  with  Willpower.  The 
number of net successes determines the number of turns that 
the Moriman may control the target. This art costs 2 Pathos 
plus 1 Willpower, and it confers 1 point of temporary Angst.
Items with a closer link to a targeted wraith lower the dif-
ficulty of most Behest arts. For example, a Moriman who has 
a skinmask of a wraith he’s attempting to control or find has 
will do so more easily than a practitioner who has only relics 
belonging to the Restless in question.

Appendix:  Orpheuseath is not the end. 

Many believe this, but few truly know 
it. Ghost stories are often relegated to tab-
loids or horror movies in the mainstream, 
but plenty of mortals believe in something 
following  death  without  voicing  their 
suspicions. It still takes many wraiths by 
surprise when they first cross the Shroud and discover their 
new  existence.  Hardened  atheists  and  pragmatists  are  the 
largest group of unbelievers, doubting the spiritually inclined 
no matter the evidence.

The Orpheus Group is out to change this disbelief, one 

mind at a time.

Through drugs and a technological blending of science 
and spirituality, the firm claims to be able to eject their agents’ 
souls from their bodies, enabling them to walk among the 
dead without permanently departing the land of the living. 
For  a  fee,  the  Orpheus  Group  will  send  agents  capable  of 
projecting to investigate suspected hauntings. They can put 
you in touch with your departed loved ones, or rid your life 
of a relative who simply can’t let go. For a slightly higher fee, 
Orpheus can be quietly contracted as private investigators who 
will never be seen and who can’t be stopped by petty things 
like doors or walls or locks. Pay a little more, and Orpheus 
will send a projector to sit in on a board meeting, view assets 
firsthand, and otherwise engage in corporate espionage no 
company can stop, physically or legally. After all, nobody’s 
managed to legislate against ghosts yet.

Be very quiet, and pay a lot more, and Orpheus can make 
your enemies disappear, die of a heart attack, or perish in a 
freak accident. Of course he killed himself — what, do you 
think a ghost did it?

For now, Orpheus’ exposure is limited. They show up in 
select tabloids, they’re whispered about by their corporate 
and ultra-wealthy clients, and they’re discussed in hushed 
tones  among  those  paranormal  researchers  who  consider 
themselves “in the know.”

Lexicon

or the most part, Orpheus projectors use 
terminology derived from popular culture, 
leading  to  confusing  interactions  with 
seasoned wraiths. Experienced projectors 
tend to pick up Stygian slang and lingo 
over time.
Beach: Vacation or downtime between 

missions requiring projection.

Black Heroin: Pigment (q.v.).
Cradles:  Sleeper  cryonic-suspension  tubes.  Also  called 

“coffins.” 

Crucible: Orpheus term for a circle of wraiths and projectors; 

disparate interests working together. 

WHAT IS ORPHEUS?

The Orpheus Group is a corporate group in 
the Skinlands of the World of Darkness. They 
advertise in coded websites, spread their service 
via word-of-mouth, and appear in personalized 
catalogues  for  important  officials.  They’re  a 
Silicon  Valley-esque  startup  company  that 
has the technology to pierce the Shroud and 
attempt to engage with the dead on their own 
terms. Orpheus hires individuals who’ve had 
close brushes with death and uses meditation, 
spiritually active drugs, and cryogenic technol-
ogy to forcibly eject these individuals’ spirits 
as pseudo-wraiths who can walk as ghosts do. 
Orpheus holds only a dim knowledge of Restless 
society. Orpheus possesses little knowledge of 
Stygia, operating exclusively in the Shadow-
lands and only now slowly starting to scratch 
the surface of death’s mysteries.

Fumigation: A mission involving ridding a place of wraiths 
or  projected  entities,  usually  by  destroying  them  or 
their Fetters.

Gauze: A wraith’s Corpus, so named for the weblike consis-
tency formed by plasm passing through solid Skinlands 
objects.

Ghost: Nonprojecting spooks (q.v.); a wraith.
Horror: Arcanos. 
Hue:  A  ghost  who  was  a  pigment  user  in  life,  essentially 

different from a wraith.

Lament: Project Echo terminology for the different “classes” 

of ghost.

Malkovich (slang): A Consort, especially that of a Skinrider.
Meat,  the  (slang):  Term  for  the  physical  body  projectors 

(q.v.) leave behind and return to.

Near-death  experience:  Close  calls  and  personal  experi-
ences with death, any time a mortal is forced to directly 
confront their mortality. Shorthand is NDE. An NDE 
can be anything from surviving a drive-by shooting to 
narrowly missing a fatal car accident to contracting a 
terminal illness, thereby lessening the grip of the Fog 
on the character.

Networking (slang): Sharing Pathos among a crucible.
Pigment: A hallucinogen that, rumor has it, allows the living 
to perceive the dead. Addictive, but cheap, and gaining 
popularity among casual drug users.

Post-Life Entity: The clinical term for a wraith or hue.
Project Echo: Orpheus’ ongoing research into wraith society, 
ghostly metaphysics, and the refinement of projection 
technology.

Projector: Humans who can send their souls out of their body. 

Some are skimmers (q.v.), some sleepers (q.v.).

Projector Firm: A company capable of employing and main-
taining post-life operations. Orpheus is currently the only 
projector firm in existence.

Repeater (slang): A Drone.
Shade: Orpheus Group slang for the seven types of personality 

groups that wraiths fall into. 

Skimmer: An agent who projects from her body using drugs 

Sleeper: An agent who projects from his body via flatlining 

and yogic techniques.

and cryonic suspension.

Spook (slang): A wraith or projecting entity.
Stains: Physical deformations of a ghost’s gauze, the manifesta-

tion of violent passions and personal bitterness.

Squatter (slang): A self-willed wraith who chooses to remain 
in a certain area, like an office or abandoned building.

History

SPOILER ALERT

Wraith: The Oblivion ended in 1999 with 
the  supplement  Ends  of  Empire,  detailing  a 
series  of  events  culminating  in  the  rise  of  the 
final,  catastrophic  Maelstrom  that  consumes 
the Underworld. Orpheus was a core book pub-
lished four years later, with a limited release of 
five supplements, covering the rise of the titular 
projector firm. Orpheus’ supplements delved into 
the secret history we’re going to reveal below, and 
ultimately the fate of the entire Underworld. This 
history is mostly the same as it’s presented in the 
Orpheus supplements.

If you’re a player who’d rather not be spoiled 
on the deep and heinous history behind Orpheus, 
skip ahead to the rules section on p. 477.

he technology that bridged the Shroud, like 
so many revolutionary scientific discoveries, 
came about as a complete accident.

Orpheus  began  its  existence  as  JDG 
Cryogenics,  a  startup  firm  like  so  many 
others in the mid-1990s, drawing a talent 
pool from its affiliation with Caltech. Bob 
Jackson and Anne Del Greco founded the company based on 
the precept that individuals with terminally advanced physical 
conditions could be cryogenically suspended until such time 
as their illnesses could be treated successfully. The medicine 
of  the  future,  JDG’s  pamphlets  proclaimed,  held  the  secrets 
of life and death. The key lay in surviving until those secrets 
could be uncovered. The company managed to attract a few 
investors, and while they never were precisely popular, they 
did put enough wealthy and progressive clients into cryonic 
suspension to remain solvent. 

JDG had one tremendous advantage over their competitors: 
Dr. Eduardo Fernandez, a cryonics specialist and one of the few 
people in the world with the scientific skill to freeze and reani-
mate a human body. Before JDG, the greatest impediment to true 
cryonics was the fact that portions of the human body possessed 
different tolerances to freezing; while one set of organs would 
freeze cleanly, the adjoining tissue was completely destroyed by 
the process. Dr. Fernandez relied on mummification through a 
protein-rich, cold-tolerant suspension fluid that prevented ice 
from forming and damaging tissue within the body.

Remarkably, it worked, generating a serious breakthrough in 
cryonics: JDG thawed and revived their first client just after the 
millennium. Surviving terminal illnesses, deep-space travel via 
cryonic suspension, keeping blood and organ tissues viable for 
donation for years on end — the future seemed bright. They’d 

pulled off a legitimate medical miracle, and JDG boasted that 
they could bring their clients back from the dead.

And it turned out, they had, just in a more literal manner 
than the press releases meant. Out-of-body experiences were 
frequently reported from thawed clients, and the patients re-
ported being privy to conversations they couldn’t possibly have 
been party to. One client in particular, Jane Kennedy, had a 
long flirtation with Eastern esotericism and holistic medicines, 
transcendental  fascinations  she  developed  between  lifelong 
rounds of chemotherapy, and she put this to use once she was 
in the chamber. Having died on the operating table twice in her 
life, she found herself well suited to out-of-body experiences. 
While her fellow clients found themselves merely floating above 
their bodies, Jane ventured out much further. For weeks at a 
time, she wandered the areas around JDG Cryogenics, marvel-
ing at the shattered, ruined buildings and hiding from what she 
described as roving bands of armed ghosts stalking the streets.
Kennedy approached the board with an offer of funding 
and a new mission. She’d been to the afterlife, she said, and 
she could prove it. Thanks to insider knowledge gleaned from 
long months of sitting in on private board meetings, Kennedy’s 
personal  worth  doubled,  then  quadrupled,  then  quintupled 
again.  The  rest  is  barely  concealed  public  history:  Kennedy 
became the mother of projectors, and JDG rechristened itself 
the Orpheus Group with a mission to explore the afterlife for 
human advancement, with a vision to profit from projection 
into the land of the dead.

The private history was far more sinister.

Dark Days

The scientific potential of the cryonics breakthrough was 
well heralded, but few rushed to take advantage of the expen-

470

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

sive  process,  and  JDG  soon  found  themselves 
approaching  insolvency.  Kennedy’s  experience 
and patronage allowed the newly dubbed Orpheus 
Group some breathing room to explore the new 
side  of  their  technology,  yet  early  experiments 
generated inconsistent results. Scientists of every 
stripe  were  hired  right  out  of  colleges  and 
promised  glorious,  groundbreaking  futures, 
but  were  unable  to  precisely  duplicate  (or 
explain) the science of projection even while 
backed  by  the  firm’s  specialized  resources. 
Even after Orpheus’ transition, several banks 
of cryotubes remain dedicated to rich clients, 
waiting for resurrection. In the meantime, 
Orpheus tapped (and continues to tap) into its 

trust funds to fuel talent acquisition.
Orpheus knew that projecting was possible, but 
getting replicable results took time and money. Still, by ana-
lyzing the histories of clients still in suspension, the researchers 
determined that those likeliest to succeed in “projecting” had 
survived an above-average number of near-death experiences 
in their lives — they were familiar, even comfortable, with the 
idea of their own mortality. Then the botanist team headed by 
the famed Dr. Amours Katlilian discovered that certain plant-
based drugs, especially derived from psychoactive plants found 
in the Central American rainforests, could greatly facilitate 
the act of projecting when introduced into the protein strains 
in Dr. Fernandez’s suspension fluid. Funded by the last of 
Orpheus’ cash, Katlilian led a group of interns (most of 
whom still work at Orpheus, sworn to fearful secrecy) 
into the heart of the Bosawás Biosphere Reserve on a 
quest for a plant strain that held the qualities he knew 
would unlock the secrets of the dead.

Against all odds, the botanist succeeded, returning 
as a driven and darkened soul completely dedicated to 
his work. The plant he discovered — Kakos stromithi-
carum — was highly addictive, but easily facilitated 
projection.  The  newly  territorial  Katlilian  grew 
batches of the plant in an Orpheus warehouse, 
allowing none other than he to tend the plants. 
Orpheus attempted to culture seeds and cut-
tings,  but  all  efforts  to  replicate  his  work 
with  the  plants  failed  utterly,  even  when 
they reproduced the environment of Bosawás 
exactly.  Even  with  this  breakthrough,  Or-
pheus exhausted all available funding, and was facing 
bankruptcy and the cessation of all operations.

Then another backer stepped in.

Project Flatline

The National Security Agency greatly 
expanded operations during America’s War on Terror, find-
ing themselves in possession of a vastly expanded operational 
mandate and several black budgets. Certain elements of the 

ORPHEUS

471

A CRUSADE OF ASHES
Despite  the  Orphic  Circle’s  name  and  far-
reaching reputation, they had absolutely nothing 
to do with Orpheus’ creation, mandate or salva-
tion by the NSA, at least not at first. The group 
discovered the hidden Orpheus — how not, with 
that name? — but never moved to investigate 
or  infiltrate  the  secretive  cryogenics  company. 
The reason for their early lack of interest in the 
fledgling projector firm lies in the Circle’s worship 
of the Underworld goddess entity, Diké — better 
known as Zyras, the All-Consuming. 

The  myriad  Spectre  cults  under  Zyras  saw 
their  counterpart  cults  worshipping  Lamachis 
behind  the  creation  of  projection  technology. 
Powerful Spectres wielding scissors in honor of 
their  master  swept  through  the  Shadowlands, 
purging the NSA projectors while cultivating the 
Marion Flatliners. It was enough for the Orphic 
Circle to back off, with other longtime hunter 
and medium groups taking their lead. 

agency were intrigued by Kennedy’s obvious act of economic 
espionage, and certain (smaller, quieter) elements held suspicions 
of a ghost world that lay adjacent to our own. Soon enough, the 
NSA adopted Orpheus as a “skunkworks” project — dedicated 
to the exploration of technology that could breach the Shroud.
Complications arose from Orpheus’ irate CEO, who disdained 
the company’s new partners and objected to the agency’s pressure 
to test the addictive stromithicarum extract on human subjects. A 
single, too-convenient heart attack ended all dissent on the mat-
ter, and the NSA provided the projector firm with test subjects: 
twelve death-row inmates with no appeals left, all of whom had 
multiple near-death experiences and nothing left to lose. 

The NSA shrouded Marion Federal Penitentiary in secrecy, 
paying off the warden to use the facilities and inmates, with none 
the wiser. Combining Katlilian’s drugs and Fernandez’s cryonic 
admixture, Orpheus placed all 12 inmates— dubbed Flatliners 
— into suspension. The head researchers naïvely believed that 
by holding the prisoners’ bodies hostage, the inmates would 
remain docile and compliant. They were wrong; the Flatlin-
ers discovered that not only could they exist as wraiths, going 
wherever they pleased, but they could also afflict the living, to 
the point of manifesting. Following charismatic kingsnake con 
Uriah Bishop, a demagogue convicted of poisoning 40 Southern 
Baptist parishioners at a picnic, the Flatliners strode into the 
Underworld, binding the Reapers who came for them in their 
own slavers’ chains and laughing at the hand of Fate.

Orpheus panicked, now responsible for a dozen comatose 
corpsesicles who couldn’t be revived to be executed. Its NSA 
handlers reacted with more aplomb: Within a day, a fire swept 
through the prison, killing dozens of death-row inmates and 
annihilating any physical evidence of the Flatliners or the proj-
ect. The entire incident was swept under the rug, and Orpheus 
owed the NSA a favor.

The aftermath of Project Flatline seemed disastrous, but it 
was actually a triumph for Orpheus. Katlilian was found dead 
almost immediately following the Marion Penitentiary event, 
his  death  a  complete  mystery  even  post  autopsy.  However, 
Orpheus  was  able  to  seize  his  research  notes  and  warehouse 
full of stromithicarum plants. With Katlilian’s drug under their 
control, Orpheus knew skimming was theoretically possible, 
and they ventured into the Underworld. The casualties were 
appalling, but they persisted.

A year after the Marion fires, the NSA demanded a return 
on their investment: the new projectors Orpheus had taught, 
to be brought under the agency’s auspices for espionage and 
intelligence  missions.  Orpheus  complied,  cutting  its  losses 
and taking the last of the agency’s skunkworks money to train 
a new batch of projectors who never knew about Flatline or 
the previous generation. The only remaining vestige from the 
NSA’s involvement was the strict NDA preventing Orpheus 
from making any findings from their investigations public, no 
matter the client. Breaching this at any point would provoke 
further government interference, and potential shutdown.

Project Echo

Orpheus rededicated itself to its core mission: exploration of 
the Underworld and development of technology to help bridge 
the gap between the living and the dead. At this point, it was 
keenly aware that the Restless Dead it had under its protection 
were helping them in violation of the Laws of the Underworld, 
so Orpheus altered its training crucibles to emphasize stealth 
and  defensive  techniques  over  analysis  and  research  skills. 
Rechristened  Echo,  the  ongoing  initiative  concerned  itself 
with research projects inside the afterlife itself. As far as most 
employees know, it’s the first project Orpheus had.

The NSA never allowed Orpheus to go public with their 
projectors and revelations about the Underworld, despite argu-
ments from several important players. The constant argument 
arose that Orpheus would learn far more about the Great Here-
after and the powerful ghosts that resided there if people were 
inclined to let Orpheus know when incidents occurred — offer-
ing, even paying, for their domiciles and property holdings to be 
investigated. This way, Orpheus could act as a clearinghouse and 
intelligence fusion center, determining the agendas of powerful 
clients while interacting with the elements of wraithly society 
least likely to draw attention. Along the way, they could identify 
items and structures in the Skinlands of interest to wraiths. This 
permission was strenuously denied, with emphasis placed on 
Orpheus being disallowed from retaining stocks of client and 
Underworld knowledge. They were told in no uncertain terms 

472

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

to act as explorers of the Underworld purely as an application 
for  clients,  rather  than  for  private  research,  with  threats  of 
takeover should they pursue too much of the latter.

Of  course,  rumors  were  spreading  (on  both  sides  of  the 
Shroud)  that  projector  technology  existed.  Fernandez  had 
long since left the company, and leaked information to several 
interested parties. Still, Orpheus remained secretive, protect-
ing its technology and methods from duplication. The closest 
competitors,  Terrel  &  Squib  (with  superior  pharmaceutical 
knowledge) and NextWave (a private security company using 
techniques out of the old Soviet psychic programs), were years 
— even decades — behind Orpheus.

SHADOW GAMES
Orpheus only emphasized secrecy during pro-
jection operations after the first batch of projectors 
were brought under the NSA’s auspices — those 
early projectors never properly learned to keep 
silent or remain hidden. However, they had less 
contact  with  Stygia  than  might  be  expected, 
considering that the agency restricted their move-
ments and missions to spying on the Quick and 
the occasional assassination. 

Unfortunately for them, Spectres took par-
ticular offense at this invasion of the Underworld 
by the living. They boiled out of Nihils, surging 
over  the  NSA  projectors  and  dragging  them 
deep into the Labyrinth. Powerful Doppelgangers 
stalked and murdered the embodied projectors 
by possessing nearby bystanders, then destroyed 
the wraiths they left behind. One by one, each of 
the NSA’s projectors died screaming. In several 
cases, partially manifested sleepers were torn to 
shreds  by  enemies  that  nobody  else  could  see, 
their pods cracked open to let the frozen meat 
thaw and spoil.

Horrified, the NSA quietly decided to con-
tract out Orpheus for their espionage and wet-
works missions, a relationship that continues to 
this day. Orpheus hushed the matter up in turn, 
and lets its new recruits blissfully believe there’s 
no  danger  Oblivion’s  monstrous  servants  will 
hunt them down and destroy them. 

But the past won’t stay buried. Several NSA 
agents  have  moved  on  to  other  agencies,  and 
won’t let the matter drop. Even now, Orpheus 
has  several  powerful  enemies  on  both  sides  of 
the  Shroud,  quietly  waiting  for  them  to  make 
that one fatal mistake.

Finally,  though  Orpheus  had  perfected  the  process  of 
creating and training projectors, their drug stocks were almost 
completely gone, and they needed an alternative. They found 
it  in  pigment.  Given  that  their  skimmers  tended  toward  the 
thrill seeking, Orpheus got wind of pigment long before the 
DEA ever did. Project Echo’s researchers realized the brand-new 
street drug facilitated projection just like their plant stocks — 
except pigment was far more addictive. Orpheus substituted the 
drug for the majority of their projector training, weaning their 
skimmers off before their addictions became too overwhelming. 

The Quick and the Dead

wo years have passed since leaks surrounding 
the  Orpheus  Group  reached  message 
boards, blogs, and conspiracy journals. Such 
revelations don’t cover the titanic city of 
the  dead,  nor  the  great  colonial  Citadels 
that stretch above the ephemeral skyline of 
cities in the Shadowlands. Most simply add 

to the growing belief in ghosts among today’s youth. 

Today, Orpheus offices are an eclectic mix. The brass are 
polished technocrat executives, fueled by a desire to make a 
killing by exploiting their access to the land of the dead. The 
researchers are a mix of fringe scientists and college graduates 
looking for a sweet paycheck. The field agents come from all 
walks of life, by necessity — the only qualification is a collec-
tion of near-death experiences. Cliques form rapidly, though 
researchers and field agents find plenty of things to talk about, 
and  the  competitive  nature  of  R&D  means  that  researchers 
occasionally waylay agents and ask them to test a particular 
theory or piece of equipment. Agents and researchers are in-
structed to focus only on “operations-related” questions about 
the Underworld and actively discourage staff from trying to draw 
metaphysical conclusions or learning more. This doesn’t stop 
groups of employees from privately collating data and drawing 
their own terrifying conclusions.

Project Echo focuses on six areas of interaction with wraiths 
and pursuit of projection refinement: recruitment, intelligence 
gathering, espionage, retrieval, removal, and salvation.
Recruitment 

Temp agencies rarely staff the caliber of person Orpheus 
requires for projection. Orpheus do their best to appear like an 
altruistic, medical tech-company, but their past betrays them. 
Any  monumental  good  deeds  accomplished  come  alongside 
equally monumental avarice. Increasing mankind’s knowledge 
of the Underworld is a noble goal, one that drives the research-
ers of Project Echo, but their superiors see a revenue stream 
stretching beyond death. The management of Orpheus holds 
that gazing long into Oblivion can result in profit, without truly 
grasping that Oblivion gazes right back.

ORPHEUS

473

Black heroin. Ghost dust. Pigment.

PIGMENT

The drug has only been on the club scene for six months, but it’s already red hot. Chic and easily avail-
able, adored by the casual and hardcore users aside, pigment provides a hallucinogenic high like no other, 
because it allows the user to see the dead. Smoke it, pop it, shoot it up: Whatever you want, pigment can do. 

The DEA is on the verge of appointing a task force to address the growing issue. Pigment largely defies 
chemical analysis — pigment crystals sometimes appear similar to highly refined crystal methamphetamine, 
other times LSD, but always with some added impurity that radically alters the effect on the brain. This im-
purity is in fact the basis for Orpheus’ current strain of projection drugs, a fact that would ruin the company 
if it got out. Consequently, Orpheus’ researchers don’t tell projectors what they’re slamming into their veins, 
and actively discourage missions that put projectors into contact with pigment. However, given how closely 
guarded a secret the projection drugs are, the brass passing missions to Orpheus employees might ignore the 
prohibition for all the wrong reasons.

Pigment’s also connected to hues, but exactly how is unknown. 

Pigment is notable in that it has different effects depending on how it’s introduced into the body. Each 

effect persists for (8 – Stamina) hours:

Smokers get a hallucinogen, one that produces a trippy, memory-focused high, losing one die to all rolls 
for any action undertaken while high. A successful Wits + Awareness (difficulty 6) roll focuses on the happy 
memories, while a failure produces a bad trip (and a botch results in horrifying memories rising to the fore). 
While the smoker receives intermittent Lifesight and Deathsight in this state (and thus, can occasionally see 
wraiths and auras), it’s usually chalked up to errant hallucinations.

Pill poppers enjoy a high something akin to a hallucinogenic form of heroin, a sedate and sexually-aroused 
state of mind that causes a two-die penalty to all actions and a temporary halving of permanent Willpower. 
Synesthesia is common, but the affected character’s able to see wraiths and projected entities. By spending 
two Willpower points, the character is able to project as a skimmer.

Mainlining pigment into the bloodstream via injection produces an even more potent high (and a three-
die penalty to all actions), and the user can see, hear, and speak to wraiths. Spending one Willpower point 
allows the character to project, using their Willpower rating as effective maximum Pathos (though as noted 
above, their Willpower rating is halved).

Orpheus  monitors  web  forums  and  ghost-themed  blogs, 
social  media  and  veterans’  associations,  and  support  groups 
for the terminally ill. They fund several horoscope and ghost 
hunting apps, innocuously asking users if they’ve been close 
to death. The researchers are looking for commonalities and 
stories indicating a near-death experience — and potentially, a 
viable recruit. Some projectors still suffer from life-threatening 
illnesses,  lured  by  Orpheus’  promise  of  total  medical  cover-
age. Others, such as police officers or ice road truckers, have 
performed dangerous jobs for low pay — and Orpheus recruits 
start just below six figures, more if you’re willing to undergo 
hazardous  operations  deep  in  the  Underworld  or  black-ops 
missions within the Skinlands.

Orpheus has also retained the services of some wraiths, who 
can obviously pass far more easily unnoticed within the Under-
world. They also tend to retain employment of dead projectors 
who manifest as Restless, as they often don’t have anywhere else 

to go. Only the youngest Enfants, or wraiths with a decidedly 
different agenda, ever accept an offer of employment — it’s a 
direct, open violation of the Dictum Mortuum.
Intelligence Gathering

Project Echo’s primary mission involves performing paying 
jobs for paying clients while staying away from the deepest parts 
of  the  Underworld.  Though  there  are  researchers  fascinated 
with the nature of the afterlife, and interacting with the Stygian 
Hierarchy and their satellite Citadels, few clients pay for such 
intelligence, and they are under strict mandate to not pursue 
such  avenues.  Intelligence  gathering  missions  often  involve 
posing as a new wraith and attempting to discern secrets or, 
more  rarely,  question  ghosts.  Several  projectors  have  heard 
of the various Guilds, but as Orpheus’ agents rarely leave the 
Shadowlands, it’s rare they encounter a wraith Guildmember. 
As far as Orpheus is concerned, the Necropoli are unknowable

edifices in the dim distance, and approaching any of them results 
in a swift disappearance.

device to perceive ghosts (and ping the company’s servers every 
time it picks up a positive result).

Orpheus primarily uses sleepers for lengthy research mis-
sions.  Their  periodic  absences  are  explained  to  those  rarely 
interviewed wraiths as Harrowings or Fetter maintenance (which 
isn’t a lie, after a fashion, considering projection trauma and 
the need for a sleeper’s body to heal up between missions).
Salvation

Orpheus’ advertisements are limited, but word-of-mouth 
tells stories of their ability to restore contact with the loved ones 
of private clients, or laying to rest of a troubled ghost bother-
ing the living. While many wraiths interact with their living 
Fetters in subtle ways to avoid violating the Dictum Mortuum, 
Orpheus  has  refined  their  techniques  enough  to  proactively 
solicit clients and inform them they’ve got a haunting. Along 
with their ghost hunting tech, the internal Orpheus commu-
nication devices convert a smartphone camera into a Kirlian 

Only the richest and most dedicated clients would be able 
to afford the thousands of hours and immense amount of work 
Orpheus would need to help a loved one pass on after death, 
if Orpheus could even make that work. Orpheus researchers 
are  intrigued  by  the  possibilities,  but  not  knowing  whether 
Transcendence is possible, do not consider it a cost-effective 
exercise to demonstrate. 

The majority of agents operate under a “do not interact 
with the wraiths” policy, using projection more for observation, 
information-gathering,  and  recording  of  wraith  activity.  A 
handful of operatives have discovered they can act as proxies 
for the dead and in turn be paid by the living, but Orpheus as a 
company refuses to entertain this avenue. Individual agents do, 
however, risking destruction in the Underworld by promising 
Fetter maintenance and Quick aid in exchange for fat sums. 

ORPHEUS

475

The fate awaiting an agent caught practicing such illicit activity 
would be unpleasant. 

Where desired resolutions such as Transcendence cannot 
be pursued, and neither the living nor the dead can pay enough, 
there’s a more direct option to making a ghost pass on. 
Removal (Fumigation)

Orpheus  has  agents  trained  in  Lifeweb,  able  to  track  a 
wraith’s Fetters. If the Quick are bothered enough and a wraith 
decides  to  get  belligerent  and  play  hardball,  Orpheus  plays 
hardball right back. For those wraiths who refuse to deal with 
Orpheus (or those clients who specifically ask for a wraith to 
be fumigated), Orpheus will attempt to track down the wraith’s 
Fetters and either destroy (in the case of smaller Fetters) or sever 
them (in the case of living or massive Fetters, like a building). 
Agents have killed beloved pets, melted down priceless jewelry, 
and occasionally engaged in light arson in order to properly 
fumigate a ghost.

Quietly, Orpheus trains the frontline task leaders for the 
future. While the brass and investors believe the Underworld 
to be an unlimited font of potential wealth, those who’ve 
projected know the deeper they delve into the Underworld, 
the greater a risk they take of waking the sleeping giant that 
is Stygia. Should open war ever erupt between Orpheus and 
the Hierarchy, the living will suffer more than the dead. The 
more frontline projectors explore the Underworld, the clearer 
the reality becomes: Orpheus doesn’t have the experience 
or the resources to survive. 

They believe, however, that they’d be able to lop a few 
heads off on the way down, so agents make a point to identify 
the most dangerous ghosts in an area and who they were in 
life. This research exists in a perpetually premature stage, 
until Orpheus decides to cast off the limits on their research 
and delve deeper into the Underworld.
Retrieval

Retrieval missions generally result from heavy intelligence 
gathering or salvation efforts. They account for Orpheus’ at-
tempts to acquire objects, Artifacts, or relics on either side of 
the Shroud. In the past, Orpheus has also attempted to capture 
Spectres, though these missions usually resulted in catastrophic 
failure. Still, though it’s an empty warehouse in the Skinlands, 
Orpheus’ primary relic storehouse is a small but varied treasure 
trove of ghostly items and lesser Artifacts. Experienced, trusted 
projectors often counsel younger crucibles to stash away prized 
or powerful relics for their own ends, depositing them in caches 
accessible by projectors. 
Espionage

Espionage jobs usually fall into one of two categories: in-
vestigative and corporate. Investigative is much more common 
(and more pedestrian), and doesn’t pay as well. Corporate is 
lucrative, glamorous, and incredibly dangerous.

For  richer  clients  looking  for  a  private  investigator 
who will remain truly unnoticed, or corporate clients will-
ing to spend a great deal, Orpheus employs their agents on 
external espionage missions, spying on the Quick from the 
Shadowlands. All projectors have access to the same suite 
of  senses  wraiths  “enjoy”  —  especially  Sharpened  Senses 
and  Lifesight  —  and  unless  the  living  have  some  sort  of 
necromantic protection or pay Orpheus a retainer to not be 
spied upon, they’re exceptionally vulnerable to a projector 
gaining  intimate  corporate  knowledge.  While  some  decry 
Orpheus as a protection racket, retainers are slowly growing 
and  represent  a  stable  and  steady  income  rather  than  the 
large lump sum of a single espionage mission.

No court, as of yet, is willing to admit the testimony of 
the dead, though one projector has been brought up on charges 
of insider trading. She was acquitted, but only after a lengthy 
court battle after her claims of “projection” were dismissed as 
the influence of psychoactive drugs or an outright deception. 
Orpheus  considers  lobbying  for  testimonies  from  the  dead  a 
long-term goal, but for the moment it encourages its projec-
tors to pursue a private detective’s license and simply lie about 
how they came upon their information if called to the stand. 
This has led to several news stories surrounding the cryogenics 
company Orpheus. These tell-alls always rumor forays into the 
world of ghosts, but are accompanied by crackpot conspiracy 
theorists and bad science, adding to the company’s cover. They 
do not desire public scrutiny.
Wetwork

As  the  Smiling  Lord  recognized  so  long  ago,  the  dead 

make exceptional assassins.

Besides espionage, the NSA and through them the CIA 
and  Homeland  Security,  continues  to  employ  Orpheus  for 
the occasional targeted killing. Orpheus only gives such mis-
sions to its most trusted and reliable projectors. A powerful 
spook projects, finds the target, and either possesses them or 
finds some other way to kill them. All it takes is a single foot 
jammed down on the accelerator or a faulty stoplight to cause 
a fatal accident, while a Befuddled jogger can fail to realize 
he’s running far too hard for his heart to keep up. Disposing 
of any wraiths that might result from the kills, of course, is 
part of the service as well.

Beyond  that,  projectors  can  observe  network  passwords 
being typed in or precisely measure the server architecture of 
national rivals, greatly aiding the agency in pursuit of signals 
intelligence.

Rumors abound about this kind of work, both inside and 
outside Orpheus. As a side effect of wetwork training, certain 
agents  have  taken  it  upon  themselves  to  act  as  vigilantes, 
punishing those whom they feel have escaped retribution: drug 
dealers, mobsters, crooked politicians. Even with the need for 
secrecy drilled into every Orpheus projector, it’s only a matter 
of time before they’re found out, and trouble follows.

Flatlining — Orpheus Systems

Projection

PROJECTORS VS. WRAITHS
Projectors, whether astrally projecting skim-
mers or cryogenically frozen sleepers, differ from 
wraiths in a few ways:

None  possess  a  Shadow.  Instead,  they 
have  Stains,  partially  controlled  expressions 
of self-loathing.

Their Pathos, Willpower, and Corpus are subtly 
bound together in a concept Orpheus calls Vitality. 
This concept renders projectors tougher in some 
ways, yet more vulnerable than wraiths in others.

The  psychological  makeup  of  projectors 
expresses  itself  more  fully,  determining  which 
Arcanoi they favor.

They don’t have Fetters, but instead have Teth-
ers, which are functionally similar but automatically 
repair themselves due to their living nature.

Projectors  cross  the  Shroud  as  wraiths,  or  as  something 
very much like a wraith. Subtly altered by their Quick nature, 
projectors are set apart from “true” wraiths in a number of dif-
ferent ways. The specifics of what differentiates a true wraith 
from a projector (signified by a class Orpheus calls the Lament) 
are of great interest to Project Echo.

PROJECTOR CHARACTER CREATION

Default Abilities

Follow wraith character creation steps, except 

where noted.

Step One: Character Concept

Choose  Concept,  Shade,  Lament,  Nature, 

and Demeanor.

Step Four: Select Advantages

Choose Arcanoi (1 Shade Arcanoi, 1 Embody, 
1 Lifeweb, plus 2 points), Backgrounds (7 dots), 
Passions (5 points), and Tethers (10 points, 5 of 
which must be spent on the physical body).

Step Five: Finishing Touches

Record  beginning  Pathos,  Willpower,  and 

Angst (all 5).

Apply Shade modifiers. Spend freebies (18).

Anyone with the proper psychological makeup can learn 
to project. Repeated NDEs and spiritually active drugs loosen 
the  connection  between  body  and  spirit.  Generally,  this  re-
quires three to four NDEs — enough, psychically speaking, to 
render the character familiar and practically comfortable with 
the experience of nearly dying. Initial training requires drugs 
(either pigment or Orpheus’ proprietary hallucinogen cocktail) 
and coaching with an experienced projector. If a candidate has 
the requisite talent to skim, it emerges during these coaching 
sessions, but even if a projector flunks their yoga sessions they 
still qualify to be a sleeper. 

The first projection is always the worst (and should be played 
through in the Prologue, in lieu of a death scene). Orpheus takes 
great pains to have the skimmer feel comfortable — projecting 
couches, dim lights, soft music — but the skimmer feels her 
soul tearing out through her chakra points as her NDEs flash 
before her eyes in rapid succession before she dies and flows out 
of her body. The sleeper’s experience is even more disconcert-
ing, though less personal: His eyes lose their focus to the sight 
of his blood draining into a series of clear bags, being replaced 
by drug-filled cryonic fluids. He’s so, so cold, until the cold is 
replaced by a numbness that slowly warms. And then the world 
snaps into focus, and he’s standing by a cold tube with a small 
window displaying his frozen corpse.

The appearance of a projector is determined as a wraith’s 
is: Usually, they look very much like they do in the Skinlands, 
though some elements of the person’s sense of self manifest on 
their body. They do not enter the Shadowlands with a Caul 
—  not  even  the  first  time,  though  Fatalism  scrutiny  reveals 
faint deathmarks from multiple NDEs like a bright light reveals 
faded scars.

A character receives the same characteristics as wraiths 
(Deathsight, Lifesight, Sharpened Senses, and Insubstantial-
ity) any time she projects. Her soul crosses the Shroud into the 
Shadowlands and separates from her body.

While separated from their bodies, sleepers bear a strong 
similarity to true wraiths, while skimmers are a different breed 
of ghost. Both types of projector may travel through the Under-
world, communicate with and physically contact wraiths, and 
become intangible and walk through walls of the Skinlands. A 
projector possesses both Pathos and Angst, though the effects 
of this fade while she’s back within her meat.

Orpheus agents have a predilection toward one or more 
Arcanoi, and this natural talent — combined with the tutelage 
of  a  few  unscrupulous  members  of  various  Guilds  —  means 
the Orpheus Group is capable of teaching most of the modern 
Arcanoi. Projectors may learn Arcanoi as normal and utilize 
the arts while projected. Projectors cannot use Arcanoi while 
in the meat (though certain Fatalism and Serendipity arts may 

ORPHEUS

477

activate  themselves,  at  the  Storyteller’s  discretion).  Of  the 
standard  Stygian  Arcanoi,  Castigation  is  the  least  familiar; 
without Shadows, projectors cannot glean the greatest benefit, 
nor do most Pardoners know how to handle a projector’s Shadow 
taint without an actual Shadow to focus on. Accordingly, most 
Castigation arts simply fail, though Purify (Castigation 3) func-
tions at +3 difficulty.

Other  powers  that  affect  wraiths,  such  as  a  vampire’s 
necromancy, generally affect projectors as well, with some ex-
ceptions — a power that would bind or compel a projector to 
a location fails when that projector is in the meat, and powers 
that would expel a projector’s soul cause them to skim instead. 
Any necromantic power that works on Fetters suffers a +2 dif-
ficulty when applied to a projector. 

Tether

Projectors do not have Fetters, yet successfully surviving 
death requires a connection to the living world. As a conse-
quence, projected entities have Tethers, which function identi-
cally to Fetters save for a few important distinctions. 
•  A projector’s strongest Tether (rated at five dots, connected 
to their body) is visible to users of Lifeweb as a slick, shiny 
silver cord.

•  Destruction of a Tether does not drop the projector into a 
Harrowing, though death of the physical body causes the 
projector to become a true wraith. Additionally, Tethers 
represent  ongoing  connections,  so  they  can  be  neither 
neglected nor resolved.

•  Tethers can suffer a Rending; use of Sever Strand can sever 
a Tether or the silver cord. However, the damage (and rat-
ing) repairs itself if the projector reintegrates with her body.

478

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

SILVER IN THE WIND
Orpheus is aware of Harrowings from first-
hand  accounts,  theorizing  that  they  represent 
some sort of tough-love process inherent to the 
Underworld. Yet the living cannot be Harrowed, 
so Project Echo has little in the way of firsthand 
knowledge.  Still,  this  doesn’t  mean  projectors 
can’t be in a Harrowing.

Harrowings take place in physical locations 
deep within the Labyrinth. It’s just barely possible 
that a targeted Nihil could drop a projector (or 
any  wraith)  into  another  wraith’s  Harrowing. 
Once there, the living projector is adopted into 
the foreign Harrowing, taking on some charac-
ter of import to the Harrowed wraith. Spectres 
swarm the projector, letting him know the way 
he should act, encouraging him to commit some 
sort of abuse against the Harrowed wraith. Once 
here, unfortunately, Spectres gleefully try to hang 
on to their new, exotic toy. Getting out of the 
Labyrinth is much tougher than getting in.

Any condition that would otherwise result in 
the projector suffering a Harrowing that doesn’t 
somehow kill him causes the projector to return to 
his body, suffering one level of aggravated damage.

Dead-Eyes

Projection changes an agent. Once they’ve seen the Shad-
owlands with their own eyes, the sight never truly leaves them. 
Projectors in the meat can activate Lifesight and Deathsight 
for a scene with a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 7), 
allowing them to perceive wraiths and Shadowlands structures. 
The multiple near-death experiences that are a prerequisite for 
projection weaken the effects of the Fog, and after their first 
projection, a projector’s never subject to it again.
Vitality

The Orpheus Group has grasped the links between Passions 
and Pathos, but the relationship between Willpower, Pathos, 
and Corpus eludes it. Hampering its efforts is the fact that the 
incomplete death of a projector seems to deepen and muddy 
the relationship between the three.

A projector’s Vitality, or maximum Pathos, can’t exceed 
her temporary Corpus rating; suffering damage causes her to lose 
Pathos as well as Corpus. On the flip side, a point of Willpower 
may  be  spent  to  energize  the  projector’s  gauze,  immediately 
providing three points of Pathos (which may exceed the pro-
jector’s Corpus rating, but which must immediately be spent 
toward restoring Corpus).

Emblem of Protection

When the first projector encountered a Maelstrom, some 
of her Pathos somehow transformed the biker jacket she wore, 
transforming it into chainmail stronger than steel and lighter 
than silk. Emblems are unique to the projector, taking on a wide 
variety of forms — it’s not unusual to see riot gear, chainmail, 
shields and robes, or anything even more esoteric the projector 
subconsciously associates with protective garb. Regardless of 
form, the mechanical effect is the same: By spending 2 points 
of Pathos, the character gains armor with a rating of 4B/2L/1A 
that also downgrades a Maelstrom’s destructive effects on the 
character by one Bell rating. For an additional point of Pathos, 
the rippling emotional energy manifests as an arcing electric 
current  on  the  projector’s  skin,  causing  one  level  of  lethal 
damage to whomever grasps her. The Emblem lasts for a scene.
Orpheus speculates that this ability is somehow related to 
projector’s living nature and is intrinsically linked to the gauze 
relics some projectors manifest, but as of yet, Project Echo has 
been unable to identify the source of the protection or provide 
a thesis for developing more Emblems.

Laments — Skimmer and Sleeper

There are two types of projectors, skimmers and sleepers, 
defined by the means by which they separate their souls from 
their bodies to project into the Shadowlands. Both are more 
vulnerable than wraiths, albeit without the ability to be drawn 
into a Harrowing. 
Skimmers 

Skimmers have mastered the ability to separate their spirits 
from their bodies naturally, through spiritually active drugs and 
unique biofeedback techniques married to Kundalini-inspired 
yoga. 

Advantages: A skimmer regenerates Pathos at a rate of 
one point per hour spent resting in her physical body. She can 
project from the meat virtually at will, and may then travel as 
normal for a wraith as far from it as she wishes. To return and 
revive  herself,  she  merely  needs  to  return  to  the  meat.  She 
may also snap back to her body reflexively by tugging on her 
silver cord. She may “ripcord” to her body as long as she’s in 
the  Shadowlands,  at  a  cost  of  one  bashing  damage  (usually 
manifesting as a nosebleed).

Disadvantages: Every scratch and wound suffered by a skim-
mer’s Corpus reverberates along her silver cord and manifests 
on her body. The claws of a Spectre slashing the projector’s 
face leave long purple bruise lines on her cheek. Any bashing 
or lethal damage she receives as a wraith manifests as bashing 
damage to her body (halved, rounding up, before application). 
Skimmers don’t suffer wound penalties from damage until they 
return to their bodies and make all soak rolls while projected at 
difficulty 5 (rather than 6). Aggravated damage is translated as 
lethal; damage rolls over to the next type as normal. 

ORPHEUS

479

A  skimmer  must  spend  one  Pathos  point  per  hour  pro-
jecting or suffer one automatic level of bashing damage to her 
body.  Additionally,  skimmers  must  purchase  Meditation  to 
project within a single turn; otherwise, they need one minute 
to project. Lastly, skimmers are largely active only within the 
Shadowlands — while they can theoretically descend to the 
Labyrinth and the Tempest, this would stretch their silver cord 
too thin for them to ripcord back. As a consequence, they must 
plan  sojourns  to  the  deeper  Underworld  carefully,  lest  their 
bodies die from accumulated damage incurred along the way. 
Orpheus protocol demands a ripcord if the projector gets into 
a fight they think they can’t win, lest they be kidnapped or 
dragged somewhere they can’t get back from.
Sleepers 

Like skimmers, sleepers’ souls leave their bodies and enter 
the Shadowlands. Instead of a comfortable little death, sleepers 
have their blood replaced with chemicals in order to drop into 
cryonic suspension, a brute-force expulsion of the soul from the 
frozen, somnolent body.

Advantages: Sleepers need not expend Pathos to project 
or  to  stay  projected.  Additionally,  a  sleeper  can  voluntarily 
shunt Angst points from his gauze back to his body, providing 
respite from that malignant energy. For each temporary Angst 
point channeled in this fashion, the sleeper’s body suffers one 
level of bashing damage (which he cannot soak), a spiritual 
punishment that the character cannot heal until he emerges 
from suspension. Once shunted, the points cannot be recalled 
or washed away via Castigation or another art. Outside of this 
channeling, projecting sleepers do not suffer health level dam-
age. Almost all damage applied shreds Corpus as if the sleeper 
were a true wraith.

While  the  Angst  persists  as  bashing  wounds,  the  reha-
bilitation process to heal the sleeper’s body and mind enables 
him to drain himself of one Angst point per day. Should the 
sleeper project again while still suffering these bashing wounds, 
the remaining Angst points immediately convert over to the 
character’s overall temporary Angst pool.

Disadvantages: A sleeper cannot project at will or in a 
hurry. Instead, he’s chemically flatlined in the cryogenic cradle, 
a process that takes about five hours. The sleeper cannot re-
enter his body until the unit warms the corpse back to living 
temperature and replaces the cryonic fluids with blood (which 
also takes five hours). While in suspension, the sleeper cannot 
recover Pathos. 

Shades

Orpheus defines seven different Characteristic Templates, 
or Shades, that projectors fall into. Partial roadmaps for how 
the projector approached life (and thus how they begin their 
journey into death), Shades help to define a projector’s traits 
and capabilities through Favored and Prohibited Arcanoi.

ON TERMINOLOGY

Orpheus uses multiple terms, such as Shade, 
that  have  very  different  meanings  in  the  Un-
derworld. Some of this comes from an imperfect 
understanding of terms they’ve heard or overheard 
from Restless over the years. There’s also sheer 
institutional bloody-mindedness to consider, as 
no one at Orpheus wants to change the forms 
and databases they’ve painstakingly constructed. 
Regardless,  the  conflicting  uses  of  those  terms 
often leads to confusion or even outright hostility 
in interactions with the denizens of the Under-
world, as there are quite a few wraiths who hear 
the term “Shade” and are ready to use Arcanoi 
first and ask questions later.  

Nature dictates a character’s identity, and Demeanor their 
outward face, but a projector’s characteristic Shade determines 
her  approach  to  the  Underworld.  A  Haunter  may  have  any 
number of reasons why she can’t rely on others, but the ultimate 
result is always that she feels better relying on tools and ma-
chines than the fickle whims of others. Wisps may be altruistic 
or masochistic in equal measure, but they always charm and 
negotiate their way through both life and death. 

Someone’s Nature may be Competitor, constantly striving 
against others to prove himself, but he could also be a Polter-
geist (his Shade), believing that the best way to win out over 
others is through anger and force. His Nature might even feed 
his spiteful fury every time someone challenges him. Alterna-
tively, a Wisp Bon Vivant might combine his enthusiasm for 
slick deception and fast talk with his desire to enjoy life, seeing 
each new exploit as amusement rather than work. 

Each Shade has a recommended list of suitable Natures 
that fit well with the concept. These suggested Natures are not 
exclusive, and players are encouraged to choose the Nature and 
Shade that best fits their character. Each Shade has also two 
Favored Arcanoi, which they learn at a slight discount (–1 XP/
level), and a Prohibited Arcanos, which is more difficult for the 
Shade to learn (+1 XP/level). Shades are limited to common 
arts when learning Arcanoi. Finally, belonging to a particular 
Nature group also grants modifiers to starting Pathos, Willpower, 
and  permanent  Angst.  Wisps,  Phantasms,  and  Marrows  are 
rarer than other Shades. 
Misery Loves Company

A general power inherent to the Shade system allows the 
projector to spend 1 point of Pathos to empathize with a wraith 
in her same Nature group. Connecting in this way grants her 
+1 dice on all Social rolls involving that wraith.

Sense the Strands

Nature Groupings
Banshee

Characterized as possessing natural insight into the psycho-
logical and the metaphysical, Banshee Shade Natures tend to 
be introspective souls empowered by their insight and empathy. 
They typically aren’t shy about much. They can, however, be 
slow to act by dint of being too willing to play devil’s advocate 
or trying to see all the sides of a situation.
Suggested  Natures:  Caregiver,  Martyr,  Mediator,  Optimist, 

Penitent

Favored: Keening and Fatalism
Prohibited: Outrage
Pathos: +0 
Haunter

Willpower: +1  Angst: –1

Haunters constantly adapt, making themselves at home 
wherever they may be. Driven toward new experiences, Haunt-
ers are never content with their current situation. They are the 
spirit of enterprise and adaptation, making themselves a vital 
part of their environs, wherever that may be. This expresses 
itself in a predilection toward possessing objects. 
Suggested Natures: Deviant, Explorer, Rebel, Rogue, Survivor
Favored: Inhabit and Flux
Prohibited: Keening
Pathos: +1 
Poltergeist

Willpower: +1  Angst: +0

Poltergeist Shade Natures are passionate, wrathful souls, 
drawing strength from the ability to chain and unchain their 
inner fury when necessary. Poltergeists master their frustration, 
using that energy as a blunt force. While experience grants their 
anger a razor’s edge, there’s still a huge wellspring of activity 
quivering underneath. Their frustration is difficult to control 
by definition, but it gives them power, and they cannot exist 
without it.
Suggested Natures: Activist, Bravo, Critic, Eye of the Storm, 

Pragmatist

Favored: Outrage and Keening
Prohibited: Fascinate
Pathos: +1 
Skinriders

Willpower: +2  Angst: +1

Characterized  by  an  immensely  strong  sense  of  self, 
Skinrider  Shade  personalities  revel  in  physical  and  mental 

contact. Skinriders are the essence of control — of others, of 
themselves, of the situation. The world needs sorting out, and 
only they have the will and power to make it so. Organizers 
and manipulators, they’re the strong hands where other Shades 
may be soft touches.
Suggested Natures: Bureaucrat, Competitor, Leader, Pedagogue, 

Traditionalist

Favored: Puppetry and Lifeweb
Prohibited: Moliate
Pathos: +0 
Wisp

Willpower: +3  Angst: +1

Orpheus  categorizes  Wisp  Shade  personalities  as  subtle 
and charming, preferring indirect action and rarely taking a 
blunt  approach  to  anything  in  life  or  death.  Gifted  with  an 
ability  to  charm,  Wisps  are  the  life  of  the  party.  Supporters 
say they act to cheer others and to grease the wheels of social 
interaction; detractors note their tendency toward manipula-
tive  social-engineering  experiments  using  everyone  around 
them as guinea pigs.
Suggested Natures: Bon Vivant, Child, Conniver, Jester
Favored: Fascinate and Argos
Prohibited: Puppetry
Pathos: +1 
Phantasm

Willpower: +0  Angst: –1

This Nature group consists of dreamers who seek to share 
their vision with others. Creatives of all stripes, they want to 
express  themselves  in  whatever  medium  is  at  hand.  Always 
eager  for  an  audience,  they’re  endlessly  enthusiastic  when 
gripped with inspiration.
Suggested  Natures:  Architect,  Avant-Garde,  Gambler,  Vi-

sionary

Favored: Phantasm and Pandemonium
Prohibited: Inhabit
Pathos: +2 
Marrow

Willpower: +1  Angst: +1

Social chameleons who embrace novelty and alternate per-
spectives, Marrow live to reinvent themselves. While Haunters 
make a place for themselves within their circumstances, Marrows 
change themselves to fit and blend in. The key phrase for the 
Marrow is “I change,” as they often define themselves by their 
ability to adapt to transforming circumstances and situations.
Suggested Natures: Enigma, Fanatic, Follower, Scientist

ORPHEUS

OPTIONAL RULE: SHADES OF GRAY

The Shades as presented here are reserved 
for projectors, representing another differentia-
tion between the mostly dead and the all dead. 
Orpheus isn’t precisely aware of this distinction, 
instead classifying all post-life entities into Shade 
personality groupings.

If a Storyteller wishes to make Shades avail-
able to a standard Wraith game as a character 
creation template and “splat” axis, the template 
should be applied before freebies are spent. Me-
moriam should no longer affect a character’s start-
ing Pathos, and Shade Favored Arcanoi should 
cost 4 freebie points (while Prohibited Arcanoi 
cost 7 freebie points). Characters should not be 
permitted to “double down” on Guild Arcanoi 
and Shade Arcanoi experience discounts. Wisps 
should be offered either Fascinate or Intimation as 
a Favored art, depending on how much contact 
the game will have with the Quick.

In general, this ties wraiths (and a Wraith 
game, in turn) far more strongly to the Skinlands 
and the concerns of the living, while dramatically 
ratcheting  up  tensions  between  Stygia  and  its 
Necropoli over the Dictum Mortuum.

Crucibles

Orpheus Group teaches its projectors to be more tightly 
bonded  than  most  wraith  Circles,  forming  close-knit  groups 
Orpheus  calls  crucibles.  Crucible  membership  offers  certain 
advantages. Characters within a crucible may share Pathos with 
one another so long as they touch, an experience that leaves 
one partner emotionally enlivened and the other drained. They 
also can take part in what’s called yoking, a means of magnifying 
the ghostly powers they’re bringing to bear. 

Most  crucibles  are  carefully  put  together  based  on  psy-
chological  profiles  and  a  willingness  to  work  together,  since 
forming the crucible requires a measure of intimacy and trust 
that’s normally reserved for close friendships. There’s no upper 
limit to the size of a crucible, though they tend toward groups 
of three to five. More than that makes it increasingly difficult 
to find compatible individuals. 

The actual process of forming the crucible takes several 
weeks of intense “together time,” where the members become 
sufficiently comfortable with one another to be able to share 
spiritual energies. At the end if this time, there is a formal ritual 
of bonding. This requires a Willpower point from each member, 
and any hesitation can cause the crucible’s formation to fail. 

Benefits

One effect of the crucible system is the ability of a projec-
tor to link with another spook, augmenting the Arcanoi of the 
linked spook. This ability is called yoking, between donor and 
beneficiary. Orpheus trains their crucibles for weeks to properly 
master yoking, which provides yet another reason for crucibles to 
remain together. Each Benefit is linked to a specific Shade, and 
is treated as an Arcanos activation costing one point of Pathos.
Banshee:  Natural  team  players,  Banshees  make  everything 
easier. Lower the difficulty of an Arcanos art by two. This 
effect lasts for one turn.

Haunter: Efficient souls, Haunters help to maximize a power’s 

efficacy. Double the duration of another Arcanos.

Marrow: A master of adaptation, the Marrow makes herself 
useful to her entire crucible. The projector acts as a nexus 
for multiple Benefits, allowing two other crucible members 
to yoke to her while she passes both Benefits to a third 
beneficiary.

Poltergeist: Poltergeist fury hits like a sledgehammer. Add +3 
damage dice to the next Arcanos-powered attack. Lasts 
one scene or until a successful hit.

Phantasm: The subtle power of the Phantasm renders the yoked 
power difficult to resist. Add +2 to the difficulty of the roll 
to resist the Arcanos, or add 1 success if there isn’t a roll. 
Skinrider: Flesh is not Corpus, but the Skinriders know that 
many of the same principles that apply to one apply to the 
other. Lend two dice to a Physical Attribute roll for an 
Arcanos’ effect. This effect lasts for one turn.

Wisp: Calm yet mercurial, a Wisp prefers to offer her aid indi-
rectly. The beneficiary may reroll any two failed dice on 
an Arcanos roll (except for dice that show a one).

Stains

No projector has a Shadow. Though they don’t suffer Ca-
tharsis or find themselves subject to the endless psychic battle 
of the Shadow, projectors still grow angrier and more choleric 
when their current Angst rating rises above their Willpower. 
Rather than give the Shadow purchase over the Psyche, Angst 
ascendant mutilates the projector’s corpus with Stains — vis-
ible, physical reflections of their worst fears and self-loathing.
Manifesting Stains

A character gains one Stain for every two dots of perma-
nent Angst. A projector may manifest a Stain for the cost of a 
point of temporary Angst, bringing forth the chosen Stain for 
a number of turns equal to his permanent Angst rating. The 
projector may manifest as many Stains as he possesses, so long 
as he’s willing to take the Angst points.

When temporary Angst rises above permanent Willpower, 
the  character  immediately  and  uncontrollably  manifests  his 
Stains, making the hideous mutations apparent on his Corpus. 
By spending a point of Willpower, the character may suppress 

482

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

the Stains for the duration of the scene, but they manifest im-
mediately afterward. If the character’s Willpower is 9 or above, 
her powerful will keeps her worst instincts in check until the 
moment they overwhelm her forever.

When permanent Angst reaches 6, one of the character’s 
Stains manifests permanently. For each dot of permanent Angst 
above  6,  the  character  gains  a  new  permanent  Stain.  Some 
permanent  Stains  can  be  Moliated  away,  but  always  return 
after a session (or the next projection, whichever comes first). 

Considered a social stigma among wraiths and a mark of 
distinction among Spectres, the harsh and spiteful demeanor 
evinced by Stained characters causes difficulty in relating to 
wraiths. Each cumulative Stain the character manifests increases 
Social difficulties by 1 among wraiths (and decreases such dif-
ficulties among Spectres by an equal amount).

Each Stain carries with it both an Advantage and a Dis-

Using Stains

advantage. 
Adder’s Scales

This Stain turns the character’s skin into dappled green-
gold snake scales, rendering them better protected and more 
supple, a trait of those who hate being pinned down by anything.
Advantage: Difficulties to escape bonds or effect athletic 
maneuvers decrease by one. The scales also grant the character 
an extra soak die.

Disadvantage: The character is more easily startled and 
likelier to react by lashing out first. The player must succeed in a 
Willpower roll (difficulty 6) when surprised to not inadvertently 
lash out physically or verbally. Also, they look like a snake.
Armor of Corpulence

A character manifesting this Stain grows grotesquely huge. 
Although he can barely move and see over his enormous mass, 
he’s resistant to harm.

Advantage: The character is immune to bashing damage and 
takes only one quarter the normal damage from lethal weapon 
attacks. Fire, electricity, poison, and other environmental sources 
of Underworld harm still inflict normal damage.

Disadvantage:  The  character  finds  it  difficult  to  move, 
as their vast bulk inhibits their actions. All movement-based 
actions suffer a +2 difficulty, and movement is restricted to a 
maximum of three yards a turn.
Barbed Corpus

Some people feel their appearance isolates them from the 
world, and put up barbs to keep other people away. This Stain 
manifests that feeling of isolation.

Advantage: The barbed hide offers one soak die, and inflicts 
one die of lethal damage against unarmed opponents who strike 
a character with this Stain. The character can also grapple or 
punch opponents to inflict the lethal damage.

Disadvantage:  Each  scene  the  character  manifests  this 
Stain,  the  character  must  make  a  Willpower  roll  (difficulty 
6) or accidentally brush up against an object or Circlemate, 
inflicting a soakable level of lethal damage. 
Brutish

The  character  grows  into  a  hulking  version  of  himself, 

three feet taller and 100 pounds more massive.

Advantage: The character gains one additional soak die 

and three extra dice to Strength rolls.

Disadvantage: The character is slow and plodding, dropping 
his initiative by five and halving his movement. The character 
also loses one die from all Intelligence and Appearance dice pools.
Chameleon Skin

For some, being noticed is deeply disconcerting, and they’d 
much rather fade into the background. The character’s Corpus 
shifts color to blend into their surroundings.

Advantage: The character gains three bonus dice on all 

Stealth rolls.  

Disadvantage: The spook has no control over this Stain. 
Whenever it manifests, the character’s Corpus shifts color and 
texture  according  to  the  background,  rendering  the  wraith 
hard to see and his body language difficult to discern. In these 
situations, the character’s Social difficulties increase by +1.
Compound Eye

The character’s eyes grow and form to be like those of a 
fly — huge, scintillating red domes that slide to the sides of 
their head, composed of hundreds of small hexagonal lenses.

Advantage: The character has a much wider range of visual 
acuity, allowing her to see everything within a 360-degree radius.
Disadvantage: The character loses distance vision while 
this Stain is active, incurring a penalty of +2 to all difficul-
ties involved in ranged combat or trying to spot anything at 
a distance.
Corpus Cilia

Small, gentle quills cover the wraith’s arms, allowing him 

to measure the flow and displacement of air.

Advantage: Perception difficulties are reduced by one, and 
all impairments to the character’s vision (from injury, fog, etc.) 
are completely nullified within a 30-foot radius.

Disadvantage: All Wits-based rolls suffer +1 difficulty, due 
to the character’s concentration on the information coming 
from those extra senses. Additionally, the character suffers –4 
to all rolls in a Maelstrom rated one bell or above.
Dark Speech

A spook who sees himself as caustic or bitingly witty when 
pressed might develop this Stain, which transforms his tongue 
into a sharp dagger, gout of black flame, or liquid column of 
acidic spittle that can extend up to seven feet away 

ORPHEUS

483

Advantage: The character acquires a ranged Brawling at-

tack that inflicts Strength + 2 lethal damage at range.

Disadvantage:  The  character  has  no  internal  editor  to 
censor his speech, inflicting spiteful verbal abuse on all within 
earshot. He must succeed at a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) to 
speak properly and stop from tinging his speech with insults and 
veiled threats. Success or failure lasts for the duration of a scene.
Gossamer Webs

It’s difficult for some people to let things go, and they feel 
like every new challenge tears a little bit of their soul away. The 
character’s Corpus grows layered and sticky, allowing him to 
slough off a web to snare opponents or encase targets.

Advantage: On successful Brawl attack, the character may 
leave behind a sticky swath of Corpus to trap, blind, or pin an 
opponent. Each Corpus level expended in this matter creates 
two dots’ worth of Strength binding. If the Brawl attack suc-
ceeds by three or fewer successes, the Storyteller dictates the 
effect, but if the player succeeds by four successes or more, he 
may dictate which part of the body is hampered. Valid targets 
include eyes (blinding), legs (hinders mobility), or arms (in-
creases Brawl difficulties by 2).

Disadvantage: The character automatically loses Corpus 
when entrapping an opponent or passing through objects within 
the Skinlands. He can still remain intangible for the scene, but 
he loses one Corpus for each large object he passes through (and 
it can’t be reabsorbed).
Hammer Fists

Some people ruin all they touch, and find that expending 
more effort makes the situation much worse. The character’s 
hands grow massive and are covered with massive chitinous 
protrusions.  The  character  may  throw  incredibly  powerful 
punches, but can do little else with their hands.

Advantage: The character delivers Strength + 3 dice of 

bashing damage with unarmed attacks.

Disadvantage: Difficulties for all tasks requiring manual 

dexterity increase by 3.
Spider’s Bristles

People are capable of surprisingly vile things, especially 
under trying circumstances. This Stain causes a carpet of hairy 
bristles to erupt from every pore of the character’s extremities, 
giving the appearance of a thick, wiry coat of fur. 

Advantage: The character can climb up walls and other 
sheer surfaces as a spider would — only soulsteel or the slickest 
surfaces of the Labyrinth cause her to slip. If she tries to adhere 
to another wraith, she fails.

Disadvantage:  All  difficulties  involving  a  light  touch 
are  at  +1.  The  projector  may  negate  this  with  a  Willpower 
roll (difficulty 7) to disentangle from an object accidentally 
glommed onto.

OPTIONAL RULE: A STAINED SOUL

With  the  biochemistry  of  life  suppressing 
the Shadow, Stains remain the only expression 
of the impurity of the soul on projectors. Wraiths 
are already capable of utilizing their Shadows for 
additional Angst and Shadow dice, but allowing 
them Stains allows the opportunity for outright 
cultivation. Storytellers who wish to allow their 
players  to  manifest  Stains  should  set  them  as 
the equivalent of a 5-point Thorn for a Shadow, 
similar  to  Shadowed  Face.  Shadows  can  offer 
to  activate  a  Stain  at  their  discretion,  though 
they are limited to one voluntary activation per 
session, and doing so grants them two points of 
temporary Angst.

Spite-fueled Arcanoi

Spite is fundamentally a negative emotion, but it can also be 
a fuel for greatness. Bereft of Shadows offering dice to enhance 
Arcanoi, some projectors turn to directly powering the arts with 
their dark sides. This is a common Stain, and rumors abound 
of training centers where certain projectors can teach a spook 
to replace one of their extant Stains with this one.

This Stain causes the Corpus to glow with a sickly orange-

purple light.

Advantage: The projector adds two dice to all Arcanoi rolls.
Disadvantage: The corrosive elements of Angst add a dark 
side to the Arcanoi. Keening may not incite positive emotions, 
while Puppetry causes health levels in damage to the possessed 
(one level per minute). While the effects are ultimately up to 
the Storyteller, tainting Arcanoi with Angst always nullifies 
benefits and intensifies destructive, negative effects.

Hues

Wraiths in washed-out colors, fading and translucent even 
in the Underworld, hues perpetually feel as if they’re less than 
they should be, mostly because they are less than they should be. 
And the faded colors are literal. Hues appear drained entirely 
of color, ghostly even to ghosts.

Like  all  wraiths,  hues  possess  enough  ties  to  the  living 
world and Passion to come into the next with self-awareness 
once they’ve been Reaped. But one other thing ties hues to-
gether: pigment. 

Every hue tried pigment in their lives, even if they only 
smoked it once at a party. Many were addicts, and most lost their 
lives to the drug’s effects. Some hues even say that the scratchy, 
syrupy craving still crawls over their Corpus, giving them a Pas-
sion that remains unfulfilled unless the hue Skinrides a mortal 
high on pigment. Hues are generally Reaped and recruited by 
the Emerald, Grim, or Skeletal Legions, as the deathmarks of 

484

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

hues tend toward the ravages of drug abuse, regardless of how 
the hue actually died.

The quiet, malignant Shadows of hues (called the Quies-
cent) don’t help the situation. With dampened Pathos, hues 
have little time before succumbing to Spectrehood or falling 
into Oblivion. A hue is already his own worst enemy, and their 
Shadows  compound  the  situation  by  refusing  to  conform  to 
expected behavior.

The few Pardoners who’ve examined hues are puzzled by 
their  odd  Shadows  and  inconstant  deathmarks,  but  nothing 
aside from their monochromatic demeanor seems to directly 
distinguish them from a normal wraith. Their ability to manifest 
Stains and tendency to gain Angst at catastrophic rates aren’t 
apparent at first, or even prolonged, glance.
New Shadow Archetype: The Quiescent

All  warfare  is  based  on  deception,  and  the  greatest  trick 
this Shadow can pull is convincing you it doesn’t exist. Nearly 
ubiquitous in hues and unknown in other wraiths, the Quiescent 
speaks only rarely, and the Psyche may legitimately believe they’re 
“merely”  dialoguing  with  themselves.  Quiescent  Thorns  tend 
toward the subtle, and even Catharsis is viewed as the hue merely 
“losing himself” for a bit. Shadow Dice are offered during periods of 
emotional duress or anger, and while a hue’s cognizant that they’re 

INCOMING

Orpheus  and  the  Hierarchy  haven’t  yet 
grasped  the  true  horror  of  pigment.  Pigment’s 
secret is that everyone who tries the drug becomes 
a wraith. Most cross the Shroud as Drones. It’s 
only the few who would’ve likely become wraiths 
anyways who can determine that they’re different 
from the Restless around them, and that more 
and more wraiths with their particular quirks are 
coming across the Shroud as the use of pigment 
expands.  What  this  ultimately  means,  no  one 
knows — it could be more fodder for the forges, 
or a population explosion that swamps the ability 
of Necropoli to assimilate them. 

feeding their darker instincts, they usually don’t recognize how 
literal that metaphor has become. As a result, hues are notably 
reticent and reluctant to undergo Pardoner examination (“No, 
I don’t hear voices in my head!”). Even seasoned Pardoners are 
stymied somewhat by the terse communications of a Quiescent 
Shadow, though Castigation functions normally on them.

ORPHEUS

485

HUE CHARACTER CREATION
Follow wraith character-creation steps, ex-

cept where noted.

Should a hue manage to purge the spectral 
ichor  from  their  plasm,  they  literally  brighten, 
with the difference in Backgrounds and Fetters 
immediately granted to the character. If they pos-
sess Memoriam, it now factors into their starting 
Pathos calculation.

Step Four: Select Advantages

Choose  Arcanoi  (5  points,  no  Guild  Ar-
canoi),  Backgrounds  (5  points),  Passions  (10 
points, but one must be a Dark Passion), Fetters 
(8 points) and Stains (3). Hues may manifest all 
of their Stains for the scene at a cost of 1 Pathos. 

Step Five: Finishing Touches

Record beginning Pathos (5) and beginning 

Willpower (5).

Spend freebies (15). Pathos may not be raised 

higher than 7.

Shadow Creation

As Chapter Six (p. 221), but every Hue pos-

sesses a Quiescent Shadow.

Gauze Relic

The  Dark  Passions  of  a  Quiescent  Shadow  mirror  the 
regular Passions of a hue — even if the emotional resonance 
isn’t attached to a normally negative emotion, the Quiescent 
may draw Angst from it. Whenever a hue draws Pathos from 
his Passions, his Shadow likewise grows stronger. If a hue man-
ages to purge his pigment taint and become a full wraith, the 
Shadow immediately converts to another Archetype, with Dark 
Passions more appropriate to the character.

You Can’t Take It With You — Orpheus Backgrounds

While  Orpheus  does  employ  a  small  number  of  Enfants 
(and a few Lemures and Doppelgangers with their own agen-
das) by offering family stipends, Fetter maintenance, and all 
the streaming video a wraith could watch, the vast majority of 
Orpheus agents are still alive. As such, Eidolon, Haunt, Legacy, 
and Memoriam are unavailable to living characters. Most other 
Backgrounds — Contacts, Influence, etc. — describe relations 
within the Skinlands rather than Stygian society. Certain other 
Backgrounds, such as Relic or Notoriety, are of limited utility 
and unlikely to be possessed at high ratings. In return, however, 
projectors benefit from Destiny, Gauze Relic, and Reincarnation, 
which are unavailable or rare among wraiths.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Destiny

For whatever reason, Orpheus projectors often seem touched 
by destiny. They find themselves gravitating toward a particular 
role in life, edging toward some heroic sacrifice or grand tragedy. 
For each point in Destiny, a character’s player may reroll one 
dice roll per session. They must take the second result of the 
roll, and may not reroll any set of dice more than once.

The  Storyteller  may  allow  some  wraiths  to  take  this 
Background, if fulfillment of their ultimate destiny involved 
their death. Such wraiths invariably cross the Shroud with the 
markings of Fate on their Corpus, as do any projectors with 
this Background.
X 

You stand without Fate’s protection, but also without 
Fate’s constraint.
One reroll.
Two rerolls.
Three  rerolls.  The  markings  of  Fate  shine  clearly 
on your gauze, and characters at this level will be of 
interest to those who dwell on the Isle of Eurydice.
Four rerolls.

•••• 
•••••  Five rerolls. Your projections are portents that thunder 
throughout the Shadowlands. The Labyrinth buzzes in 
anticipation and fear of your approach, and the Lady 
of Fate sends her agents to aid — or obstruct — your 
endeavors.

Project Echo’s researchers believe, correctly, that relics are 
themselves ghosts of items, with some undefinable emotional 
link keeping them bound to existence. While projectors are 
not yet dead, they’re able to harness the energy of their volatile 
Corpus more ably, channeling the emotional links to manifest 
an item’s ghost. By focusing on an item of personal significance 
to them and spending Pathos, the projector’s Corpus shim-
mers, melts slightly, and literally congeals into a relic. This 
relic must be chosen when this Background is purchased, and 
may not be altered thereafter.

The act of manifesting a gauze relic is highly disturbing to 
most wraiths, who aren’t capable of such a feat. Most assume the 
projector Moliated a hidden pocket into their Corpus, or used 
an Argos variant to hide the motorcycle that suddenly birthed 
itself from the wraith. Others assume the relic to be tainted, 
and immediately address the projector as if he’s succumbed 
to Catharsis. Regardless, the Background’s use immediately 
marks the projector as something different.

A gauze relic requires one point of Pathos to congeal for 
the scene. Once a relic’s fully manifested, it may separate from 
the projector. A congealed relic lasts for the duration of the 
scene, regardless of whether the scene lasts for two hours or 
two turns (the aforementioned motorcycle would last a single 
uneventful trip). Once the time is up, the gauze relic dissolves 
back to where it came from. If the gauze relic is destroyed, 

the projector loses a point of Willpower and takes a level of 
Aggravated damage.

Under  no  circumstances  may  a  wraith  take  this  Back-
ground. Should a projector die, their dots in this Background 
are refunded as experience, a small compensation for the loss 
of their life.
X 

Your gauze refuses to manifest an item. Do you have 
no material possessions that you value?
You have a small relic, such as a knife.
Your  gauze  relic  is  more  powerful,  like  a  handgun, 
though you’re on your own for the ammunition. Relics 
at this level possess general functions or grant +1 to 
an Ability roll related to the item.
At  this  level,  gauze  relics  are  capable  of  electronic 
interactions  when  invested  with  Pathos,  such  as  a 
wi-fi  connection  that  reaches  across  the  Shroud. 
Alternately,  larger  objects  can  be  manifested  (such 
as a bastard sword or assault rifle), or relics that grant 
a –2 difficulty bonus to one Ability roll.

• 
•• 

••• 

••••  Gauze relics are now more akin to Artifacts, and are 
capable of intricate mechanical or electrical operations 
(such as a motorcycle that works without fuel).

•••••  You possess some sort of powerful talisman that does 
something truly unique, allowing for +4 to an Ability 
roll, or +1 to an Attribute roll.

Reincarnate

Many cultures believe in reincarnation, and whether or 
not it’s a belief your character ascribes to, the temporary death 
the  character  suffered  has  lain  bare  the  deceased  elements 
of past souls within their own. Dormant flashes of past lives 
rise to the surface when the need is great, and the character’s 
muscle memory isn’t always their own. 

This  Background’s  rating  operates  as  a  free  dice  pool, 
which the player may use each game session to supplement 
his  existing  dice  pool  (or  even  roll  on  Abilities  he  doesn’t 
normally possess). With each level in the Background, the 
character gets one additional die for the pool.  

The  Storyteller  may  rule  instead  that  each  dot  in  the 
Background  represents  one  predetermined  Ability  that  the 
character may draw one die for, thereby restricting the player 
from intruding on another character’s specialties.
X 
• 

You have no remembrance of your past lives.
You have a case of déjà vu that allows you to draw 
upon a skill from a past life.
You may derive capabilities from quick flashes of the 
past.
Past friends you’ve never met are in your mind, and 
you occasionally remember their names.

••• 

•• 

••••  The  quick  flashes  evolve  into  extended  flashbacks, 

which are often pertinent to the situation at hand.

•••••  You remember portions of past lives the way an adult 

remembers kindergarten.

Storytelling

n  Orpheus  chronicle  differs  significantly 
from a standard Wraith game. Wraith usually 
begins  after  the  characters  have  died  (or 
when their fate is inevitable) and handles 
the deceased character acclimatizing to the 
Underworld.  Orpheus  characters  are  still 
alive,  of  course  —  but  they  meet  wraiths 

on a relatively equal playing field.

At least, that’s what they’d like to imagine. For all their 
powers and the ability to retreat to the Skinlands, projectors 
are  interlopers  in  the  land  of  the  dead,  playing  with  forces 
they cannot truly comprehend. The survival of Orpheus and 
projection technology relies on the characters being smart and 
cautious, both things the Orpheus Group requires them not to be.

Mood: Ghost Stories for Ghosts, by Ghosts

An Orpheus chronicle focuses on humanity’s experience 
with the world of ghosts, rather than the Underworld and the 
fullness of life after death. It’s a horror story and an unravelling 
mystery thriller, the story of brave but unwary souls walking 
deep  into  the  world  that  lies  beyond  the  grave.  There’s  far 
more of a focus on the Shadowlands and the liminal barrier 
of the Shroud, on the machinations of the living world and a 
sun-dappled company trying to dig deep into death.

Theme: Mankind Descendant

Humanity’s reach exceeds our grasp. Mortality is fundamen-
tal to the human experience, a constant with which everyone 
must grapple. Yet now, technology has granted mankind the 
ability to prematurely enter the world of death and return. When 
mortality  is  conquered  by  the  human  experience,  when  the 
Shroud becomes as simple to cross as a journey of a few hours, 
death begins to lose meaning, and thus the human experience 
becomes  radically  altered.  The  consequences  of  Orpheus’ 
technology are potentially dire — even apocalyptic — for both 
Quick and dead. Definable, reproducible proof of the afterlife 
will  inevitably  cause  massive  shocks  in  society  and  religion, 
with devastating wars erupting as nations and companies seek 
to exploit the lands of the dead — and the dead fight back.

A Skinlands Chronicle

While projectors can theoretically venture to Stygia, many 
of their Favored Arcanoi — not to mention their clients, bodies, 
and employer — remain focused on the Skinlands. As a conse-
quence, Orpheus projectors tend to stay within the Shadowlands, 
interacting with wraiths in Necropoli and focusing their powers 
where they’ll be most effective. Orpheus games remain there as 
well, with the Shadowlands and the greater Underworld being 
a place to which the characters very rarely venture, rather than 
where they spend the bulk of their time and energy.

ORPHEUS

Antagonists

Stygia

Orpheus pays extraordinarily well, both in terms of sal-
ary and benefits, but asks incredible, dangerous things of its 
employees. Even experienced operatives still find themselves 
doubting  what  they’re  dealing  with  on  a  regular  basis,  and 
the Underworld constantly churns up new, deadlier surprises. 
Still, crucibles find reasons to stick together once the agents 
take the field.

The Orpheus Group considers its greatest enemies to be 
rival projector firms, unfaithful business partners, and under-
performing projectors. This alone speaks to their ignorance and 
their priorities, as they rarely consider the existential threat the 
Dark Kingdom of Iron or the Shadow-Eaten pose. Ultimately, 
the greatest threats to Orpheus have yet to take notice of the 
fledgling projector firm, and both sides are far safer that way. As 
Orpheus continues to explore the Underworld, however, things 
will inevitably fall apart. They cannot remain unnoticed forever. 

The powers that be in Stygia are not stupid, contrary to 
what any given Renegade Circle might think. Reports of strange 
wraiths have made their way back to the isle, and various Le-
gions have begun sniffing around at the anomalies. For now, 
investigation is all that’s going on, but that could change should 
any of the Deathlords feel threatened. Local Anacreons, more 
likely to have to deal with an influx of hues, are already taking 
their own steps to secure their citadels, and there are places in 
the Shadowlands where any anomalous “wraith” will get tossed 
into the forges, “just to be safe.” Those wraiths most likely to 
deal with Orpheus agents are those on the fringes — Renegades 
and Heretics, or nominal Hierarchy subjects more concerned 
with their own day to day than with the hoary edicts of the 
Dictum Mortuum. The more involved a projector becomes in 
the workings of the Empire of the Dead, the more precarious 
their situation becomes.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The Living

Society at large and most governments laugh at the claims 
Orpheus makes to its clients, and have yet to truly consider pro-
jection technology a viable area for legislation. In the meantime, 
Orpheus has a small team of lawyers working on legal briefs for 
any potential situation.

It’s a well-kept secret that the biotech firm Terrel & Squib 
is close to cracking the secrets of projection, though they can 
only duplicate skimming — Orpheus alone holds the patents 
and technology to create sleepers, allowing for months-long 
forays into the Underworld. 
Spectres

Orpheus doesn’t truly understand Spectres, but they think 
they  do,  which  is  perhaps  the  most  dangerous  mistake  they 
could possibly make. The Spectres most often encountered by 
Orpheus agents are Doppelgangers, whose pleasant appearances 
belie their knack for ruthless, deadly manipulation of projectors. 
Bereft of Shadows, projectors have no personal experience with 
the Shadow-Eaten beyond fighting them in the Shadowlands, 
and as such they’re terrible at identifying when their new friend 
is actually an agent of Oblivion. While Orpheus is theoretically 
aware that there are bad people on the other side, few of their 
agents are skilled at Castigate. As a result, they’re often easy 
prey for Spectre infiltrators offering help to wayward projectors.
Two Malfeans were instrumental in the creation of Orpheus: 
Zyras, who opposed the projector firm and destroyed the first 
batch of projectors; and Lamachis, who engineered the creation 
of pigment and, indirectly, projection technology itself. It was 
a Spectre under the command of Lamachis who possessed Dr. 
Amours Katlilian, and more of her cult used their corrupting 
influence to empower the rare plants that could absorb spiritual 
energies across the Shroud. The same Spectre who possessed (and 
murdered) Dr. Katlilian now holds sway over Dr. Lionel Squib, 
a genius biochemist and one half of Terrel & Squib. Having 
intimidated his partner into silence, the Oblivion-compromised 
Squib devised the chemical formula for pigment, farming out 
production to maintain his anonymity. Slowly but surely, the 
Shroud weakens around the areas hardest hit by use of the drug, 
and the hue population continues to grow.

Involving Orpheus

If the Storyteller wishes to involve Orpheus in a Wraith 
chronicle, it will shift the focus of the game toward the Skin-
lands and resolution of Fetters. Projectors are liminal beings, 
and Orpheus encourages staying close to the Skinlands. Cut-
ting  deals  with  the  Restless  Dead  is  part  of  Orpheus’  modus 
operandi, giving wraith characters attached to their living Fet-
ters an introduction to the Orpheus Group. They might seek 
out Orpheus to work their Passions in defiance of the Dictum 
Mortuum, or Orpheus might come to them, seeking to lay them 
to rest for some mysterious benefactor. Alternately, Legionnaires 
intent on enforcing the Dictum Mortuum could decide to shut 

DEFUNCT PROJECTS

While Project Echo dominates and defines 
Orpheus,  two  other  projects  cast  a  long,  dark 
shadow over the optimism that ironically pervades 
the attempt to understand and conquer death.

Project Flatline: The secret experiment to 
create the first sleepers using 12 death row inmates 
as test subjects, detailed in the History section. It 
ended in success, though all the inmates escaped 
as  wraiths.  Orpheus  has  assiduously  scrubbed 
all references of Flatline from its databases and 
destroyed the hard copies of the project reports, 
attributing its success to an early version of Echo. 
Unfortunately, the research notes were particu-
larly treasured by the researchers who gave their 
lives for the project, and the notes persist as relics 
across the Shroud.

Project  Prometheus:  With  the  loss  of  the 
first projectors to Angst, Orpheus speculated as 
to whether or not Spectres could return to wraith-
hood.  The  Prometheus  research  project  aimed 
to discern the essential nature of Spectres and 
whether Lifeweb manipulation, Pathos therapy, 
and  emotional  treatment  could  have  an  effect 
on their psychological makeup. Despite several 
promising avenues of approach, the project was 
discontinued when the lead researcher was pos-
sessed  by  a  Spectre  subject,  murdering  three 
interns before killing himself. The lead researcher 
persisted as a wraith, but has shown a notable dis-
like for the idea of continuing his work. The final 
subject remains at large, whereabouts and status 
unknown. The project comes up for reactivation 
each quarter, and it’s been passed on every time. 

Orpheus operations down, or there could be some modus vivendi 
reached between projectors and their Restless counterparts to 
mutual benefit. 
Mixed Chronicles

If a Storyteller permits a mixed chronicle, there are mul-
tiple ways to bring the characters together. They could all be 
in Orpheus’ employment, with the Restless agreeing to assist 
their living colleagues in exploring the Underworld. Alternately, 
the wraiths and the projectors could be facing a mutual enemy, 
whether it be Legionnaires hunting down Dictum Mortuum vio-
lations or living enemies looking to shut down the projection 
labs by hook or by crook. And then there’s always the possibility 
of having one player take the role of a Doppelganger, there to 
lead the hapless mortals down the pleasant path to Oblivion. 

ORPHEUS

489

Wraiths  willing  to  work  with  Orpheus  are  likely  to  be 
younger and potentially disaffected with Stygia and the Dictum 
Mortuum.  Some  may  have  worked  for  Orpheus  before  their 

demise, while others might be hues unable to assimilate fully 
into Stygian society and looking for any allies they can find. 

THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME

Deep in the Labyrinth lie the temples of the Neverborn, the nightmares of creation themselves dreaming 
new horrors into existence in their restless slumber. But at the very heart of the Labyrinth is a place where 
existence and nonexistence meet. Wraiths call it the Mouth of the Void. It is the literal point of no return, 
beyond which there is only the nothingness of Oblivion. 

Spectres, however, know it by other names — the All-Devourer, the Infinite Maw — even as they work 
to feed its eternal hunger. By far the most pervasive title is a simple one: the Grand Maw. In the murmurs that 
float into the deepest reaches of the hive-mind, this slurs into a single word: Grandma. Over time, the belief 
has crystalized that Grandma — referred to more respectfully as Grandmother by the Onceborn who hope 
to someday curry her favor — is aware, and that a terrible intelligence guides the vast hunger of the Void. 
Whether this is true or not is largely a matter of hushed debate, as no one has ever returned from beyond the 
all-consuming gate to speak of what might be behind it.

WtO is the rule of inspiration. Like we wrote will, it is 
a story about the world that flows after death and someone 
who wants to interference.

I’m sure that no rule can make you think about life and 
death like this. Especially in Asia, we have theory about hun 
(the spirit that leaves) and P’o (soul that left behind). Among 
them,  story  about  soul  wraith  (although  it  was  characters 
story) will make you think about the life that you spent.

Well...  sometimes  it  is  too  harsh  that  marginal  men 

speaks ‘instead’ about shadow.

La muerte es necesariamente el asunto más serio y por 
lo tanto el más poético. A lo largo de un plazo muy corto 
de  tiempo  perdí  en  circunstancias  muy  dolorosas  a  varios 
miembros de mi familia, Wraith me hizo una pregunta, ¿qué 
haces vos en tu vida diaria para no llenarla de Olvido? No es 
un asunto moral sino ético,  pensar sobre el comportamiento 
propio.  En  Wraith  las  decisiones  pesan,  la  trascendencia 
reclama responsabilidad consigo mismo y con los otros, no 
hay  un  derrotero  fácil.  Y  allí  radica  la  esperanza  sincera, 
desinteresada: en los actos propios; jugar en serio.

Wraith was not my first role playing game, not the one 
I have spent the most time in my life, but it is undoubtedly 
the one that made a most resounding impact in my life.

Its atmosphere and ambiance caught me from the first 
chapter: characters torn between love and hate, suffering and 
hope, empathy and selfishness... Stories of Life coming from 
Death that make you asses not only who you are in that world 
but who you are in this one. Those rules of the supernatural 
that help you become more human.

This 20th Anniversary edition is a gift to all those un-
conditional fans who, as myself, do not play it as much as we 
would want to, but keep the feeling that we never stopped 
playing and there’s no Maelstrom to snatch that away from us.

I  witnessed  The  Beast  Within  with  Vampire  and  the 
strength  of  a  pack  with  Werewolf.  I  felt  the  wonders  of 
Magick — but then something completely different arrived. 
Grim chains and a strange lock on the cover, a totally dif-
ferent concept of play where you also get to play the thin 
voice in another players ear... And the most weird place of 
the World of Darkness I ever had the opportunity to lurk 
my  players  into.  Oblivion,  forgetting  as  a  key  concept  — 
so  very  different  to  the  other  games.  So  different  themes. 
So much horror. So much beauty. So many stories, forgot-
ten, — or worse....

Wraith: the Oblivion is one of the most creative role-
playing games I ever loved. The authors played with the myths 
of the afterlife and developed  a perfect setting, cynical and 
ruthless. Perhaps the most desperate, original and bold White 
Wolf effort to provide verisimilitude to a supernatural subject. 
Its remarkable innovation was the role of the shadow: the 
perfect template for character’s dark side. 

When I read the first review of the game, I thought it 
was crazy. When years later I tried it, I had an unforgettable 
immersive experience.With its attention to internal conflict, 
this game has certainly helped me to improve my taste as 
gamer and organizer of gaming sessions.

I  bought  the  first  edition  of  Wraith,  with  the  glow-
in-the-dark cover, on its release and the book left me both 
confused and excited about the premise of the game. It was 
my first foray into ST-ing a WoD game and as supplements 
were released, my understanding of the game’s setting grew. 
The several Wraith campaigns I ran throughout the years (and 
editions) brought out the best in my players, and often the 
worst in their characters, in ways I never experienced with 
any other game. The bleakness of Wraith definitely made it 
not everyone’s game, but I always felt that besides the dark 
and gritty, there was always room for hope in the World of 
Darkness gloomiest game.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

There  are  many  fascinating  game  lines  in  the  World 
of Darkness, but Wraith:  the  Oblivion is not only one of 
them — while other games tell stories about humanity and 
bestiality, Wraith: the Oblivion draws the players into the 
dark corners of a human soul. Dead, but not able to forget, 
the  fettered  souls  are  beings  of  passion  —  and  forgetting. 
This is a game, where a character has to choose between love 
and transcendence, where his memories might be the biggest 
obstacles. A game, where your fellow player is the voice of 
your darkest wishes and deepest fears, trying to drag you down 
into the eternal void of oblivion. Wraith: the Oblivion is 
one of the most intense games I ever played!

I first was hooked into ghost stories by Orpheus. After 
ten month of  playing it I realized how much I love the whole 
ghost-theme and started  exploring Wraith: the Oblivion. 
The Wraith revealed before me as the  most painfully beauti-
ful, emotional, psychological and deep part of WoD setting. 
I always loved stories that left me sobbing quietly for days  
because of them, and Wraith: the Oblivion consists entirely 
of such stories.

Kasia “Vargnatt” Szuliak

Ghosts  as  characters  that  give  physical  manifestation 
to deep personal impulses and ambitions have always been 
fascinating to me. And Wraith was the first RPG to show 
me how this particular drama can be played in a way that 
actively involves at least three people at the table. A game 
that doesn’t have to be about the mission, the city or the 
afterlife, but it’s definitely about your character.

I do not have any personal experiences with being dead 
yet, thankfully. Also records of experiences from others are 
as unreliable as mine at best, to understand death I have no 
choice but to put forth theories about it. Telling stories about 
it is one way to understand death and what, if anything comes 
after it. Wraith: The Oblivion is a very good framework to 
create the stories (and perhaps comforting lies). It also gives a 
very humane approach to one of the biggest certainites about 
death,  that  one  would  have  longings,  unsolved  problems, 
unspoken words, and unexperienced life... perhaps as shallow 
as the next installment of your favorite series... We may not 
be able to “complete” a life, but we sure can tell stories of 
our protagonists who has the ability to do so... and perhaps  
find the peace to rest in...

This isn’t Heaven.
This isn’t Hell.
This isn’t anything you could have imagined. 
Death wasn’t the end.
Death wasn’t the answer.
Death was just the beginning.
So what do you do?
So what do you do?
Do you listen to the voice inside your head telling you just to let go?
Or do you still fight, still love, still feel the passion that won’t let you rest?
Oblivion’s the easy way out.
Life after death is hard.
Choose.
You have Eternity to weigh the consequences.

WRAITH: THE OBLIVION™
It’s not about death.
It’s about what comes after.
